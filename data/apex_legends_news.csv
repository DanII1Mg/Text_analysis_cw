1172470,DEC 2025: ANTI-CHEAT DATA SHARE,"INTROHi legends, welcome to our Anti-Cheat data share following Season 26! Our team is constantly dedicated to maintaining and improving competitive integrity in Apex Legends and this blog exists to provide additional transparency and share the ongoing work we're doing. This data share will not represent all of our team’s work as we are somewhat limited in what we can share as we do not want to tip off cheat-makers; there are always more initiatives happening behind the scenes. WHAT’S NEWIn Season 26, our Anti-Cheat team rolled out a new bot detection model. In collaboration with Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), we also deployed a new detection that expands on Direct Memory Access (DMA) detections for various cheat vendors. We believe these two additions will help curb the account selling market as we make things more challenging for bad actors to buy pre-levelled accounts. This should lead to a decrease in cheaters found in-game and an increase to the overall health of our game.Additionally, our team made strides in identifying and banning various compromised handheld consoles that were modded to run cheats.Let’s dive into the data! Take a look at the line graph and the table below and then read on as we break down the information.INFECTION RATESMatch Infection Rate (MIR) is the percentage of total matches that includes a cheater and it only takes one cheater in a match of 60 people to mark the match as “infected”. For more information about MIRs, please refer to our Anti-Cheat blog from last season.Let’s look at the MIR on PC first. As you can see from the table above, Season 26’s launch had the lowest MIR since we began measurement at 5.8%. And, while we saw the typical increase during the Split, the S26 Split was still below others measured. On consoles, you will notice a slight uptick at the start of the most recent split. But when looking at the line graph, you’ll see that, despite the increase, the number is still quite low overall. We are also focused on improving our detection models to better identify unauthorized peripherals. This is critical to us as we drive towards continued positive impact on the console MIR, and an overall better experience for console players.Overall, this is a metric where a lower number is always better and we’ll always be chasing further reduction. We still have work to do to bring this number down as much as possible and will continue to communicate our progress. BANSOur team continues to target cheaters with drive and dedication in each and every split. In Season 26 alone we banned over 92,000 accounts for a variety of reasons including botting, cheating or abusing exploits.A quick note about our ban process: Typically, we issue a 24-hour ban as a quick, actionable way to remove a suspicious account from the ecosystem. The Anti-Cheat team then completes a thorough investigation and decides if a more serious (or permanent) ban is warranted. This is why sometimes problematic accounts seemingly only get a short-term ban initially; it’s often a temporary solution while the Anti-Cheat team completes their analysis. A more severe ban may follow, depending on the details. REPORTS PER USERWe’re happy to share that Reports Per User on console in the most recent split are the lowest they’ve been in recent seasons! We are attributing this dip to improvements made to our detection models which have led to more efficient targeting of teaming and bots. Mid-season, we deployed our next-generation bot detection model and banned more than 1,000 accounts in the first 2 weeks. Typically we see an increase in RPU at the split, but because of reduction in bot reports we actually saw a decrease compared to season launch and the lowest split value since we began measurement. PROTECTING YOUR EA ACCOUNTWe've recently seen a few high-profile cases of compromised accounts. Our support team has been able to get these accounts back to their owners. As a reminder, there are a few steps you can take to protect your EA Account.Turn on two-factor authentication (follow the steps here)Never reuse passwords across different websitesBe cautious about the information you share onlineFor more help, read our guide to keeping your EA Account safe. LOOKING TO THE FUTUREWe remain dedicated to sharing Anti-Cheat information as frequently as we can with as much transparency as possible without showing our hand to cheat makers and bad actors. Thank you for reading and we’ll chat more about Anti-Cheat soon! ",1765216878,

1172470,Apex Legends™: Matchmaking Test Update,"Welcome back to the latest Apex Legends Matchmaking dev update! Grab a comfy chair, your favourite warm beverage, and settle in for our latest update.In this blog, we’re going to cover:A refresher of key matchmaking conceptsTest Results: 26.1 Ranked matchmaking testMatchmaking health motivated Duos changesThings you can do to (possibly) improve your matchmaking experienceWhat is next for matchmakingMatchmaking Key Concepts RefresherIf you have been keeping up on our Matchmaking Blogs (links here), then you can probably skip this section, or use it as a refresher and read on.Apex Legends’ matchmaking systems try to balance two main criteria for an optimal player experience: filling a lobby with similarly skilled players and doing so within a certain amount of time. It can only fill a lobby from the pool of available players currently online, who are actively seeking a match, on a specific platform (unless you have crossplay enabled), in a specific region.The system has parameters for each mode that control the acceptable skill disparity between “similarly skilled players” thus allowing them into the same lobby. However, this also needs to be balanced with ensuring players aren’t waiting in queue for too long as a result of the available player population at that moment.Platforms and regions with higher overall active populations at key times will result in smaller skill variance in matches. Active player counts (depending on platform and region) have a “peak” and “valley” each 24 hour period, when they are at their highest and lowest counts, respectively.The above graph illustrates the peaks (typically between 7pm and 10pm, local time) and valleys (in the middle of the night) of the number of matches being made across different hours of the day for a single region and players can expect similar trends throughout each season.Population is the key to establishing matchmaking that is both fast and “tight.” In theory, the fastest and tightest skill lobby would result from there being 60 players all matchmaking for the same game mode, at the same time, on the same region server, playing on the same platform, AND having the same skill value.As that is simply not the norm, we attempt to find the best matches for you for when you’re playing, and that sometimes results in longer queue times.We're always looking to improve the overall quality of your experience, share what we're working on and give context based on your feedback.Test Results: 26.1 Ranked Matchmaking TestNow that we’re all caught up, let's review the matchmaking test and the result from 26.1.This was our second test attempting to remove Masters tier (which includes Apex Predators, as they are the top 750 Masters tier players, per platform) from matchmaking with Platinum players and below.In this test, which ran for just under two weeks at the end of Split 2, Masters players were only able to match with other Masters and any division of Diamond (I through IV).The goals of this test (and this blog) were to:Determine if we can safely restrict Masters to play against only other Masters players and Diamond tierEnsuring every player that searches for a match is able to find one eventually, even if the wait is much longer than it is without the restrictionImprove our matchmaking parameters to adapt to tier populations shift over the course of a seasonCommunicate transparently with the community to set expectations for the future of Ranked matchmakingTLDR: This test successfully limited Masters matchmaking as intended and did not negatively impact queue times or skill width. When the test was run, our queue times and skill width were already near our targets, so they did not move much as a result. We are optimistic about what we learned and are eager to make improvements that can impact the overall seasonal matchmaking experience, not just at the end.The Ranked tuning changes in Season 26 increased the effort required to achieve higher tiers, resulting in lower-than-previous populations in Diamond and Masters. These lower populations pushed matchmaking at these tiers to the upper limits of what we consider acceptable queue waits and match skill-width for an ideal player experience. As a result, players outside of Masters experienced similar matchmaking before and during the test.One big takeaway for us from the last two matchmaking tests is that our ability to more aggressively adapt matchmaking to shifting populations could create more consistent experiences over the course of a season. We’ll dive more deeply into this challenge and resulting opportunity below.The above graph shows the percentage of players in each Rank Tier, per day, over the course of Season 25. Diamond was hitting about 20% of total players near the end of Split 2; this population is what allowed us to more easily restrict Masters to play against only Diamond I players.When we compare this to the distribution across Season 26 below, there is a dramatic difference in populations in the high...",1764182242,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1691520782_1764183341_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

1172470,Apex Legends™: Amped Patch Notes,"AMPED OVERVIEWWe’re starting the hype train for Season 27: Amped, right now, and this is your invitation to get on board! There’s plenty to be excited about this season: major changes to Olympus, Valkyrie retakes the skies, while Rampart and Horizon are getting tune ups, the meta is shifting to close range chaos with a new ‘Double Tap Alternator’ Hop-Up and Gold Laser Sight for pistols and SMGs, and we’re introducing fun updates to Tridents! Grab your friends, squad up and get ready to dive into Amped!For additional insights into some of Amped’s key updates, check out our highlights blog from last week and for details on all seasonal changes, please read on!ANTI-CHEATBefore we get into the nitty gritty of seasonal changes, a quick Anti-Cheat update for you all! As part of our continued efforts to combat cheaters in Apex Legends, we launched a new detection model, in early October, to assist us in investigating possible 3rd party bots in our game. In just two weeks, over 1,000 bot accounts were banned. We saw a majority of bans hit Windows PC (71%) and Switch (21%). Detected bot infection rates spiked after the rollout as expected - meaning the new tech is successfully identifying bots - then tapered off as we banned these accounts. As a result, we saw a meaningful decline of player reports (for AFK and abandoned match behavior) on Switch and reports per user over the subsequent 28 days decreased for both PC and Switch. Our team is continuing their hard work to establish and maintain competitive integrity and we will continue to provide updates when we have information to share!AUDIO UPDATESWe've been developing many new audio systems to address community feedback and improve audio reliability.This season we’re adding a new ""Focused"" mix option, intended to give you control over how you prefer to hear the action. Our new threat system will add dynamic contextual awareness to the mix. Multiband sidechain compression will help enemy footstep audio be heard more clearly. Environmental audio improvements offer a smoother blend between indoor and outdoor spaces. Additionally, we’re now armed with improved telemetry to more accurately discover causes of audio failures.We will continue to monitor feedback in our community spaces as it helps us understand how these changes affect your gameplay experience as we continue to work on these systems. For more details, please check our audio-focused dev blog.GAME STABILITYWe rolled out a profiling tool to our production servers to capture more information about instances of slow performance on servers. This tool (RProf) has commonly been used in our development environment to find slow segments of engine code and game script, but is now tuned for production use. From this, we have been able to examine and fix cases that are more unique to running the game at scale, and can more easily track degradations in performance over time. As always, game stability work is always happening behind the scenes and we will share updates when we have them! RANKEDThis season, we’re making balance adjustments to Kill Point values making eliminations more rewarding across all placements. We’re also making changes to loot distribution across Ranked Drop Zone POIs - there will still be some variance, obviously, but we’re hoping things feel a lot more even. We will continue to monitor player feedback on this change, and general sentiment surrounding drop zones. Additionally, we are reducing the requirement to earn the Ranked Ladder Champion Dive Trail from 3 completions to 2 to simplify seasonal goals, reduce grind, and make the Dive Trail more attainable while keeping it a mark of consistent top performance.You’ll find all of the details about these changes later in this Patch Notes.NEW FEATURE: WISHLISTWe want to give players some additional options for certain packs. Wishlist is a feature that will be enabled on select packs and will influence cosmetic drops for the Legends and loadouts you designate.Here’s how it works:Pick 5 Legends and 2 Weapons to add to your WishlistDepending on the pack Wishlist may only impact items of a certain rarity (specific rarity tier will be noted)If the pack drops a Wishlist-enabled item you are guaranteed at least one item from your chosen LegendsAll selections must be valid for Wishlist to be Active. A selection is valid as long as you don't own 100% of the items for that Legend or Weapon Class from the Apex Pack PoolIf a Wishlist is Inactive or Unavailable at the time of opening a Wishlist-enabled pack, the items will instead draw from the generic Apex Pack pool.You get 5 Wishlist edits per season (refreshed each new season). After that, you can keep editing anytime for 500 Legend Tokens per edit.See here for more specific details on how Wishlist functions and how our packs function.NEW: AMPED SEASONAL PACKThis season, we're introducing the Amped Seasonal Pack, available all season long.

Chase new heights in an updated Olympus, rebuilt for better flow, dynamic positioning, and elevated gameplay. Check out changes to Valkyrie, Rampart and Horizon that are sure to get your blood pumping. Welcome to the fray, the Double Tap Alternator Hop-Up, destined to make the Alternator a close range demon. Plus, expand your advanced movement toolkit with Mantle Boost and dive into the party. Ranked drop zone POIs are getting a loot distribution adjustment. This season, we also have updates to audio systems that we think legends will be excited about. With updates to the Trident AND a new Wishlist feature, this season is ready for you to lock in and feel the rush!OLYMPUS RISINGFloat into a more competitive Olympus, with NEW POIs: Somers University, Gravity Engine, Stabilizer and Dockyard! After a mysterious, second Olympus is discovered crash-landed on Págos, Horizon moves in to uncover what it all means, and to get this Olympus back in the sky and competition ready.By reducing open space and reworking problematic areas like Orbital Cannon and Energy Depot, this Olympus aims to provide a smoother competitive experience with safer rotations and more cover. Here’s a preview of some of the new locations in this update:Somers University – Built by Horizon to explore the mysteries of the universe and honor her son Newton, Somers University replaces Orbital Cannon and brings bold architecture and high-flying lifts to Olympus.Gravity Engine – The new beating heart of Olympus, Gravity Engine replaces Energy Depot and harnesses the power of Branthium to keep the city afloat. Lifts, zip rails, and verticality collide making this POI the next hotspot on Olympus.Stabilizer – This platform in the sky replaces Docks and is responsible for keeping Olympus properly aligned. Floating rocks from the planet below provide a path to its outer ballast structure.Dockyard – This camp near Hydroponics gets a massive upgrade, combining nostalgic elements from the original Olympus with a new emphasis on vertical gameplay.And that’s not all! We’ve made tweaks to almost every corner of Olympus, with new camps to explore and additional cover in previously open spaces. We look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on these changes.AMPED’S LEGENDSWe have a swath of Legend changes this season and Valkyrie, Rampart and Horizon are in the spotlight!Valkyrie is ready to rule the skies with a revamped jetpack; she can take flight quicker and move further than ever before. Rampart’s walls now have a roof that allows her to bunker up. Charge up your amped walls by dealing damage, then charge into battle. Horizon is primed with new upgrades that enable her to either float off her lift, or quickly slam to the ground.Get all the details on the Legend changes and more meta updates in the Patch Notes on November 3rd, 2025.DOUBLE BARREL DEVASTATIONSay hello to our little friend, the “Double Tap” Alternator Hop-Up! Get ready for devastating close-range firepower and watch enemies drop before they know what hit them. Harnessing the power of both barrels at the same time this smg-shotgun hybrid excels in the hands of any Legend that can close the gap and double tap (rule #2).MANTLE BOOSTWe’re adding another tool to your movement toolbox—officially! Give yourself a burst of movement by activating Mantle Boost as you climb up from ledges or walls, and use it to dive into your next fight. If you took the time to master what our community calls Superglide, don’t worry it isn’t going anywhere and remains the high bar for skill - Mantle Boost brings similar functionality with higher accessibility for all legends. Adjustable on-screen indicators will help you achieve perfect timing so you can work this technique into your battle strategy!AMPED RANKED PLAYWe’re adjusting loot quality across Drop Zones in Ranked play! The new Drop Zones sparked many internal and external discussions, one of which is about the fairness of different POI loot quality when you have no choice on where to drop.To assuage these frustrations, you will see more consistency in loot quality across different POIs. There will still be variance, but they will not be as extreme. Our goal is to have each match feel more fair, no matter where you drop. We will continue to monitor community feedback and reception.TRIDENT TUNE-UPSTridents are getting a tune-up this season! Starting in Season 27, they will feature improved handling, better and more lenient boost control and an all new ability to jump and glide over rough terrain. In addition to a wealth of handling changes the Trident now deals low ramming damage when barreling into opponents.

1172470,Ranked Matchmaking Test - Season 26,"As part of our ongoing efforts to improve matchmaking in Apex Legends, it's time for another round of Ranked matchmaking testing. Starting today, Master players and above can only matchmake with Diamond players and other Masters and Predator players.At the end of the previous season, our test of limiting Master players to only match with Diamond I players was received positively, and positively impacted the queue experience of most players. More on that here.However, our last test resulted in some players not being able to find a match in a reasonable time due to shifting population levels in Master and Diamond I players for their region, platform, and the time of day.It goes against the core of our matchmaking philosophy to purposefully create scenarios where certain players face challenges finding matches within a reasonable amount of time. Sometimes this can happen due to things outside of our control, but we strive to create rules where everyone will eventually find a match.Despite positive results, we held off on implementing another test for Diamond and Master players with our Season 26 Ranked tuning and the introduction of Drop Zones resulting in fewer players in Diamond and above, shown in the graphs below.The goal of this specific test is to understand, both in terms of player feedback and queue health, what the minimum population of Master and Diamond players must be to enforce a restriction, and when that could happen over the course of the season.25.1 - Ranked Tier Distribution, 3 weeks before the end of the season 26.1 - Ranked Tier Distribution, 3 weeks before the end of the season The above graphs show what the populations looked like 3 weeks before the end of each season.This is also why the design decision was made to expand the matchmaking restrictions for Master players to all of Diamond, as the total combined population of Diamond is now enough to support this change.We have also heard feedback from players that the difference between Master players and Platinum players is too wide of a skill gap to be in the same lobby, but matching with Diamond players more consistently meets your expectations.We will continue to explore options on how to best approach mid-season matchmaking when we have moderate populations of Masters and above, but not enough to create hard restrictions. To that end, in Season 27 Split 1 and the start of Split 2, Master and Predator players will still be able to match with high-tier Plat players.After the test is over, we’ll share a follow-up blog on the results and any next steps we plan on taking.Until then, happy matching!",1761152743,
1172470,Apex Legends™: Audio Update,"Apex has evolved so much since its initial launch, but something that has not changed is our intention for the sound of Apex: a balance of feedback, immersion, and emotion. Our primary focus is feedback, which delivers critical information to understand each situation, while immersion and emotion are what make the world of Apex unique and real. We strive to ensure every sound belongs in the Outlands and behaves in predictable ways. It’s worth mentioning that these features we’re adding for 27.0 aren’t all we have in store, but are a significant first step with more to come.In addition to rigorous internal testing, we rely heavily on our community’s experience to help us understand, improve, and prioritize our efforts. Just like every aspect of Apex Legends, audio is constantly developing and some of the changes we've been working on are nearly ready to be added to the game. Here’s a TLDR of everything we’re covering today that will be available with our upcoming season 27 on November 4, 2025:Updated Mixing: a new mix option to give each player the choice of how they prefer to experience the game—you can choose from the “Original” or the new “Focused” mix which reduces the volume of local player weapons (but not enemies), completely removes squadmate footsteps and increases enemy footsteps.Threat System: a dynamic evaluation of potential danger to drive contextual mix decisions for each player.Multiband Sidechain Compression: allows an active sound to dynamically lower the volume of other sounds; reducing clutter and increasing consistency. Environmental Audio Processing: new tech to allow for a more gradual blend as you approach and move between openings and doorways.Observability: new telemetry to track each time the game adjusts an enemy footstep event to allow for additional monitoring across different maps and gamemodes.OVERVIEWThere are multiple methods used to dynamically affect the game mix to feature critical sounds when needed. Our most basic method of making changes to the balance of sounds during the game are what we call ""mix snapshots,"" which we use to modify the volume and audible distance of individual and categories of sounds. Audio Voice Priority is the second layer of complexity within our audio system which helps to ensure that the sounds that matter most are played in favor of others. Some examples of this are enemy sounds being prioritized over squadmates, and threat sounds (ex. weapons, explosions) prioritized over ambient sounds. A sound's priority value is determined based on a number of factors including when it was started, its distance from you, volume, and more. Occlusion and reverb are two more keys to the puzzle that help locate sounds accurately. A sound behind a surface will have its frequency modified according to the density of the material occluding it, and the reverberation helps to identify if the sound is interior or exterior and the size of that space. This helps to identify when a sound source is in the same space as you or somewhere else. Frequency and gain are also modified by distance from the player, helping to pin-point the sound’s emitting position. All of these systems work together to provide a balance of immersion and clarity. The experience feels natural when working well, but can be jarring when it isn’t.UPDATED MIXINGThe amount of Legends, weapons, and other sources of sound has increased over our time in the Outlands and we’ve worked to maintain a consistent sonic signature for our universe. In addition to other technologies, we’ve been working on a new mix option to give each player the choice of how they prefer to experience the game.to watch videos: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-audio-updateThe new ""Focused Mix"" is optimized for threat detection and will be enabled by default starting in season 27, but you’ll be able to swap to the ""Original Mix"" that was previously the standard via the Audio Options should you prefer. Here’s some of the key differences:Lowered volume for your weapons and abilitiesCompletely removed squadmate footstepsLouder enemy footsteps: in particular a slight reduction in the volume delta between jogging and sprintingAs with everything, your feedback will be critical for us on this feature and we'll be making adjustments over time.THREAT SYSTEMWhat is important sonically changes moment to moment, and player to player. We've been working on a dynamic threat system to help drive contextual decisions that can affect the mix. Data (enemy proximity, line of sight, bullet proximity, and more) is continually evaluated to calculate a unique threat value for each player. That value can be used to affect the mix in many ways such as lowering the volume or audible distance of sounds that provide flavor but aren’t priority during combat, or to increase the volume of key indicators of potential threats such as enemy footsteps.to watch videos: https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-au...",1761059762,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_487176015_1761062400_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

We've been trying to bring her back down to earth through a series of balance changes over the last few months, but have been reluctant to touch the dash passive's speed or distance since so many players are having fun with it. This latest change is finally changing the speed of her dash, as we feel the data shows that reducing the power of the rest of her kit (even increasing the cooldown of her dash) wasn't enough to bring her back in line with the rest of the roster.",1760042651,['patchnotes']

1172470,Apex Legends™: Anti-Cheat Update,"It's time for another anti-cheat update. As Showdown begins, we wanted to share some insights into the previous season, talk about what we're doing, and take a quick look at the future. The team is hard at work behind the scenes, continuing to make progress in the fight against cheaters and unfair play. Here's a summary of what we're about to cover:A look at Prodigy : Total Bans (BT), Match Infection Rate (MIR), and Reports Per User (RPU) have fluctuated compared to the previous two seasons, as shown in the graph below. This is partly due to increased data flow, which has improved tracking and detection on consoles. Additionally, we've continued to work on tackling third-party macro devices.What we're working on : Analyze TB, MIR, and RPU in detail, three aspects of our usual objectives. To extract the data, we use several elements, which can lead to a variation in the values ​​(examples below). MIR focuses on Ranked, while TB and RPU include all modes.Recent Goals : The new tooling system has improved our ability to adapt, and will continue to evolve alongside cheats. This will help us address some of the biggest issues, including teaming and third-party bots. Since February, we've seen a 33% decrease in teaming reports, and we'll continue to monitor and refine the tool based on new findings. Targeting bots and anti-recoil systems are also key elements we're actively developing and testing.As mentioned in the last development post, we will continue to share new details where possible as they become available.A LOOK AT PRODIGYLast season saw an overall increase in total bans. The percentage of cheaters in matches and reports per user also fluctuated slightly from the previous season, depending on the platform. Additionally, we've recently seen an increase in data flow, which has paved the way for additional bans on consoles. Therefore, the numbers listed here provide a better representation of our actions than in the past. Improved tracking has helped us make more strategic decisions about prioritizing and allocating resources, including assigning new team members to regions with the most cheaters. Previously, our data was primarily drawn from the PC version due to cheating programs that don't exist on consoles. We've started including console accounts in these statistics, as well as ramping up detection and enforcement for teaming and the use of third-party macro devices. In the chart below, the percentage of cheaters and reports per user reflect the first two weeks after the introduction of each early- and mid-season patch. Total bans reflect the entire half of the season.WHAT WE ARE WORKING ONAs mentioned in previous updates , anti-cheat is a constant effort with a myriad of gears always in motion. Total bans, the percentage of matches with cheaters, and reports per user are just some of the pieces of the puzzle, but we'd like to explain in more detail what determines these values. Total Bans: The total number of suspensions (temporary and permanent) applied to user accounts through both automated systems and manual reviews. To combat unfair play, bans are used in conjunction with other measures (e.g., resetting ranking points).Match Cheating Rate: The percentage of matches in which at least one user has been reported three or more times and suspended for cheating in the last 14 days. Apex Legends has a higher number of users per match compared to other similar games, which can contribute to a higher percentage of cheating matches. For a match to be counted as a ""cheater match,"" even one user in 60 is cheating (though you may not encounter them directly or have any impact on your gameplay experience).One of the most effective ways to reduce the percentage of cheaters in matches is to apply suspensions promptly. By detecting cheaters more quickly, we'll limit their impact on matches.Reports per user: The sum of all reports against users reported 3 or more times in the previous 28 days, divided by the number of active users in the same period. Three or more reports are not required to impose a suspension. These are just general guidelines we follow to determine if someone is negatively impacting the gaming experience, regardless of the actions taken as a result of reports. Including a threshold of three or more reports is crucial because it often helps us identify those who may have been playing fairly before resorting to cheating.All measurements, including those mentioned, are taken into account by multiple factors (e.g., data centers, modes, match levels, and reporting categories). This means that values ​​can vary significantly by user, match, session, and even region depending on the data sample. Here are some examples of variables:The percentage of cheaters in matches is generally much higher in Ranked. This is where almost all cheaters congregate. Unranked modes have a much lower percentage of cheaters (between -50% and -80%) than Ranked.Furthermore, the percentage increases at the higher ranks of R...",1756834875,

1172470,Apex Legends: Matchmaking Test Update,"Late last season, we gave you the heads up about a matchmaking test that would run until the end of Prodigy’s split 2. This was born from hearing community requests for hard-limiting who Masters players could matchmake against, so we executed on exactly that to see how it would impact our matchmaking quality and to gather additional feedback and data.From July 28 to August 5, 2025, we created hard rules in our matchmaking configurations that only allowed Masters players to play against other Masters and Diamond I players. Diamond I players could match as normal. This test was needed not only to address some suggestions from the community, but also to gather data on this specific hard-limit to understand what type of impact it would have.Now that the test has concluded, we’ve compiled everything and are sharing a breakdown on our efforts and the results we’ve found.WHAT DID WE LEARN?Here’s our results from our hard-limit test that ran July 28 to August 5, 2025:Overall:Median matchmaking times remained consistent from before the change7% increase in matchmaking queue abandonment across all regions for ≥ Diamond 1Increase in average hours played from Diamond I players, but a drop for Masters players as they had much more restricted play windowsThis is fairly common towards end of season, but the drop for Masters was larger than we typically see during this time periodThis test provided some great learnings that will help us with potential next steps on how to further modify our matchmaking configurations over the course of a season.This test was generally well received by you, our community, with appreciation for our testing and transparency—which we’ll look to continue with any additional updatesOur initial announcement led to some concern around longer queue times for Masters players, especially in regions and on platforms with lower populations of Masters and Diamond I playersThat combination did end up having a negative impact as some higher tiered players had to wait extended periods during lower population times; matches did connect, but the experience fell outside of the anticipated expectations. Other regions with higher populations had healthy matchmaking during peak concurrency, but struggled to create lobbies for Masters players during off-peak times.Outside of the impact above, queue times for players that waited the longest had an average increase of 15 seconds for matchmaking. There was also a minute percentage where queues increased from ~4 minutes to 5-6 minutes.WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NEXT?Before we jump into potential plans for the future, here’s a rundown of our matchmaking goals for Ranked:Everyone should be able to find a match (even if they have to wait longer)Rank Tier width is prioritized over time spent waiting for a match (closer matches are more important than how long you wait)Increased transparency on why you’re getting matched the way you areWith those in mind, here’s what we’re working towards for our next Ranked matchmaking experiments:Expand the limit on who Masters can play against further into Diamond. We’ll be looking at a new set of timing rules for when Masters can expand matching into additional Diamond ranks after first waiting for other Masters and D1 matches.Maintain rules that prevent Masters from matching into Platinum and below (the skill gap between these is too wide to be fair).Looking at overall seasonal population growth curve to find the best time to enforce these rules, with considerations for players who hit Masters early in season before an optimal population for hard-limits and hitting our goals.Look forward to additional updates from the team as we get closer to our next rollout in Showdown Split 2. As always, we appreciate your feedback and continued passion around matchmaking and all things Apex Legends.",1755795983,

However, that flexibility also meant multiple teams could be funneled into the same POIs, leading then to a similar chaotic start as the regular drop method that we were trying to alleviate. To address this, we’ll be testing a version that matches the ALGS drop ship height. Our goal is to ensure Ranked matches feel more competitive.

1172470,Apex Legends™: Showdown Patch Notes,"SHOWDOWN OVERVIEWWILDCARDCheck out our dedicated blog here for all the cards you’ll want to have in your hand before jumping in.LEGEND UPDATESIn addition to some Controller class updates, we’ve also taken a pass at two smokeshow Legends. Good to have you back in the meta, Gas Daddy and Bangydang.CAUSTICCaustic’s gas should be deadly enough to live up to the fantasy, but lately it’s felt a little toothless. With the updates detailed below, Nox Gas has become something Caustics can trust to threaten or hold an area for a long time with windows that attackers can play around. Also, Caustic’s new Field Research perk allows him to gain additional Legend Updates—making him the first to be able to get all four upgrades at once!BANGALOREWith a whole new Legend Upgrade tree, Bangalore’s been given tons of new flexibility. Among these new options, are new breaching mechanics that allow you to clear out entrenched enemies.GAMEPLAY ADDITIONSWe’ve got three powerful additions to the Outlands with Showdown. Read on for an overview or dive into specifics with Patch Notes sections further down: Elite Weapons take the firepower from Ballistic’s personal stash and into your hands. These variants pack a punch and replace their typical counterparts for a limited-time. Showdown brings the RE-45: Burst, which swaps to Energy ammo and comes with a spin-up mechanic.Legend Amps are game-changing passives available in Unranked and Ranked BR matches. With five options to choose from, there’s an optimal Amp that could sway things in your favor in any type of fight.Locked Hop-Ups means that the looting for these boosts are no more. Each weapon comes pre-equipped with its Hop-Up waiting to be activated and unlocked for the rest of the match.RANKEDKey adjustments have been made to better reflect your performance and risks. Entry costs, placement RP, and kill points have been tuned to create more room for performance-based variance and rewarding consistent well-rounded play. The updated Challenger Bonus gives more RP to players who take on and win fights against higher-tier opponents. And those aren’t the only Ranked updates in Showdown.NEW: DROP ZONESDrop Zones will start Ranked matches faster and fairer with squads automatically spread out across POIs. Before the match starts, you’ll see a preview of your Drop Zone with a ping-able map for strategic co-ordination before locking in your Legends. Loot has been fairly distributed across POIs, so no Hot Zones here. Keep your head up, though. There’s always the chance a neighboring squad will contest by skydiving in. AURASIntroducing a brand new cosmetic option: Auras. When equipped, your Aura will be visible in the lobby, Legend selection, and during podium moments. In matches: during dives, emoting in 3rd-person, and it’s visible for both of the engaged players when reviving or finishing. You can toggle your clout on/off in the Legend Locker.Every player with access to Ranked will get the “Ascension Crest” Aura after logging-in after Showdown’s launch and it will reactively reflect your Ranked Tier going forward. Those still working on their Road to Ranked will be granted this Aura once Ranked is unlocked. ACCOLADESTime to recognize players and their squadmates for all that they do during a match—not just winning. From pulling off tricky double kills to expertly blocking damage for your squad, Accolades highlight actions that often go unnoticed, uncelebrated, and untracked. They’re designed to celebrate varying playstyles and skill, and can be earned in Unranked, Ranked, Wildcard, and Mixtape with each tracking separately.Each Accolade has up to four tiers for you to achieve as you progress and they’ll award XP too. Post-match, the summary will show your earned Accolades and your Gladiator Card the top three. You can earn and record multiple Accolades each day, but there’s a cap of 2200XP for these per day. Find the full list and your tracking under Account Progression, including descriptions, targets, and those you’ve earned this season, per mode, and how many times you’ve hit them.CHALLENGE UPDATEWe’ve updated our challenge system to try and help you progress more consistently no matter which mode you choose. Most challenges that used to require specific modes or had dual targets now count across all modes, making it easier to play how you want and still finish your Battle Pass.To keep time-to-completion balanced, some challenge targets have increased and we've added progression boosts to some modes. For example, “Deal 10K damage as a Skirmisher or Assault Legend” gets a 2x progress modifier in BR to match it to Mixtape’s completion time.This is part of our long-term goal to create challenges that support a wider range of playstyles. Jump in, play your way, and get rewarded just like before.NEW REWARD FLOWBased on your feedback around reward confusion, we’ve created a new summary to showcase your hard work and rewards without the plethora of pop-ups. You’ll now be able to see each reward...",1754324124,
1172470,Apex Legends: Showdown Gameplay Trailer,"APEX LEGENDS™: WILDCARDWildcard is a brand new way to play that challenges what you’ve come to expect with the typical Apex Legends matches. It’s a twist on the squads you’re used to, with streamlined Legends and the option to stack Legends as you please. It’s fun and fast with pacing built into its core thanks to an updated Kings Canyon with almost unlimited movement toys. And it’s all about the firepower here—more shooting, less looting speaks for itself. This new permanent mode allows you to take risks without worrying about your stats or RP, and you haven’t seen the last of what this mode will bring just yet.PLAY BIG, PLAY LOUDWith a mode as fast as this one, there’s just no time to loot—especially if you get that one squadmate who needs to spend the first ten minutes going through every bin. Wildcard’s about getting you into the match, trying things out, and building your Apex confidence all at the pace of Octane: ¡Rápido!MORE SHOOTINGWith a map built for movement, you won’t want to stand still. Get those guns ready and be prepared for battle around every corner, and after every revive.Weapon Leveling: level up your firepower by earning EVO Orbs by eliminating enemies, performing certain actions, and maybe even finding them in a Loot BinKitted Weapons: each piece you pick up also comes with a full batch of attachments that’ll level up with your weaponRespawning: as long as one squadmate’s alive then so are you, all the way through to the final ring. Bonus? Have them earn EVO to speed up your respawn time.Self Revive Kits: everybody gets one at drop, and if you don’t use you’ll lose itLESS LOOTINGWildcard’s system has been tuned specifically for the rapid fire match at hand:Auto Looting: bringing the goods straight to your inventory. With each elimination, ammo and EVO Orbs will appear for you to run over and automatically pick-up while keeping your head up.Reduced loot pool: no backpacks, no knockdown shields, no accelerants, no helmets, no Hop-Ups, you get it. Shield Cells are still up for grabs, but your health will auto-regen after you’ve been out of combat for a bit.Simplified Inventory: gone is inventory management with dedicated slots and auto-sorting to keep your focus where it’s neededULTIMATE PLAYGROUNDThe ultimate goal of this new permanent mode is exactly what it sounds like: an experimental playground for players to have some fun with, maybe even show off a little. We’ve had consistent feedback that players want a way to try things out and get better without the strings or confines of Unranked and Ranked, and Firing Range just doesn’t feed that hunger in the same way. Enter Wildcard. This 30 player mode has a shortened match length and tightened ring size to keep matches around the 15 minute mark. Each match should give you a taste of what’s possible without the pressure to perform. As we teased above, it also has its own gameplay parameters with different rules with Legends, a unique take on Kings Canyon, and a focus on getting those shots.STACK THOSE LEGENDSThe difference in experience begins with Legends. Everyone on the squad can pick who they want, even if the Legend has already been picked. Want three Mirages? Sounds like a lot of chatter and chaos, but go for it. In-match is streamlined too. There are no Legend Upgrades and no Class Perks. Just pure Legend power—and you may spot some unique Legend select animations too.WILDIN’ ON KINGS CANYONKings Canyon with a little bit of spice. This classic map has been updated to be the ultimate movement machine. Grav canons, zip rails, jump towers and jump pads galore bring the boost you’re looking for whether it’s running from a fight or to it. ",1753915101,

Here’s a quick TLDR of what we’re covering in today’s dev update:Amazon GameLift ServersWe moved to GameLift servers back in April.Noticeable improvements in CPU performance, reduced rubber banding, and better hit registration.Fast Patch: we’ve developed a new system that allows us to deploy client patches as quickly as the same day compared to the old method that took a longer, and often variable, amount of time.Continuous ImprovementsCode review overhaul has resulted in fewer boots to the lobby and server errors.Memory management has expanded from On-Demand Skin Loading into other areas of the game including maps and VFX.DX12 performance has improved since the sunset of DX11 has allowed the team to have greater focus on the new version.Check out our update video on Youtube or read on for more details.AMAZON GAMELIFT SERVERSBack in April, we migrated to Amazon’s GameLift servers to improve overall performance and deliver a smoother, more reliable gameplay experience for all. If you missed that, you can read our update and progress report here or check out the graph below.AWS Server Migration chart, now with more y-axis!Moving back to the present, GameLift has continued to contribute to a more stable and reliable gameplay experience with upgraded hardware and greater control of how we deploy our system and tools. We've seen improvements in CPU performance, reduced rubber banding, and better hit registration when compared to data from before the switch.GameLift is also an investment into Apex’s future as we’re seeing greater consistency, and we’ve also improved monitoring and data access, which helps us spot and solve issues faster. For example, data centers are now more flexible which allows us to adjust them locally to have the most impact.FASTER PATCHINGYou might remember back at season 20, Breakout's launch that we introduced On-Demand Skin Loading, meaning every single skin no longer loads in automatically at game launch. This has saved a lot of wasted memory across platforms and has helped improve performance because of that. Utilizing similar technology, we’ve developed a new faster patching system and we’re happy to share that this was recently implemented. Client patching used to take a longer period of time that varied depending on a few factors. This new system reduces that time down to a single day—allowing us to react much faster to community feedback and internal data. Note that this is currently limited to client patches and there are a variety of patch types that we (and game dev teams in general) utilize, but we’ve still seen an impact on our turnaround. In fact, if you encountered a resolved issue back in May, then you may have noticed how quickly we’ve been able to react now firsthand. And we’re not done yet. We’re continuing to explore ways to go even faster.CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTSWe’ve said it above and we’ll say it again: we’re continuously making improvements to enhance stability and performance. Thanks to these various efforts, we’re seeing significantly fewer outages and player-impacting server issues than we’ve encountered in the past. Here’s just a few key changes that have helped with this positive impact:Code review overhaul: this has resulted in fewer instances of players being kicked to the lobby with “server error” messages and a more stable experience overall. Memory management: we’ve identified areas where we can and have reduced memory usage to give us more room and you more uninterrupted time in the Outlands. An older example of this is the aforementioned On-Demand Skin Loading, which we’ve leveraged in other aspects of the game such as maps and VFX.DX12: the sunsetting of DX11 support has allowed us to focus our resources on the DX12 variant, making it smoother and more reliable. It goes without saying, but these are just some of the ongoing improvements the team is working on. Look for more positive impacts to reliability and your experience over the coming year, and more updates as we make tangible progress.LOOKING FORWARDWith better tools and servers in place, identifying and actioning issues will be faster than ever. There are also optimizations that we’re looking into for all of our maps via our terrain system. Game reliability will always be a priority. We’re committed to continually improving performance and reliability—and not just in stability, but across anti-cheat, matchmaking, audio, and more. They’re all important parts of Apex Legends not just for you, our community, but also for us.",1750192484,
1172470,"Apex Legends Anti-Cheat Update: June 3, 2025","In keeping with our promise of more regular updates, today we’re sharing some more details around our anti-cheat efforts and the impact they’ve had since our last check-in. TLDR: we’re seeing a continued decrease in infection rate and we’re working on lowering it even further. Anti-Cheat remains a top priority. Trends over the past three seasons and additional insights regarding our efforts show that there’s been a positive impact against those who take part in unfair play. The included graphs report two metrics: Match Infection Rate: percentage of Ranked BR matches with detected cheaters. Multi-reported Users: percentage of weekly players reported for cheating at least 3 times in the past 28 days. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a9288402022a6fc20aafea78206178f4970da971.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/dbd7c35dbff50a2b7ec04512216448a5a28eea4e.jpg These metrics adjust for fluctuations in player numbers by normalizing by match and player counts respectively. Both display a 30%+ reduction from peaks back in Season 22 (August 2024), highlighting positive impact from our efforts to combat cheating. We attribute these drops primarily to a few things: Ban on Linux Devices in Season 23: provided steeper than usual seasonal drop and helped contribute to continued downtrend. Enhanced Tooling & Automated Detections: faster banning has lowered the number of matches a cheater can infect. There are also additional ongoing initiatives around anti-recoil and other behavioral detection models to name a few. We’ll continue sharing updates as more progress is made, and appreciate your support. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit as of June 4, 2025 @ 4pm PST: We wanted to provide some new graphs and additional clarity to answer some of the questions that popped up after we shared our initial update. Here’s some further context on the Y-axis on the new graphs those looking for more info: Match Infection Rate is the percentage of matches in which at least one player was reported 3 or more times and banned for cheating within the last 14 days. While Apex Legends' infection rate tends to be higher than several other live service games, this can be attributed to the number of players in a match. 60 players in Battle Royal can be 6x the amount of players in other team-based games. Reports Per User is the sum of all reports against players reported 3 or more times in the preceding 28 days divided by the number of active players in that same time frame. Three or more times is the general guideline that we use to determine when someone is negatively impacting the player experience, regardless of the report leading to a ban. Note: 3+ reports are not required before a player is banned. The match infection rate is one of our core metrics for measuring anti-cheat success. It doesn't tell the whole picture, however, which is why we consider it in addition to other metrics such as players banned by detections, the number of player reports, or overall sentiment from the community. We’ve already made significant advancements in the past year and will continue to evolve our tools and processes to address new methods of cheating as they emerge. We will continue to provide more information as we are ready to share it. Keep an eye out for more of these updates in the future. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/40aa89f2a725f5427a12670d03c945607880f076.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/40aa89f2a725f5427a12670d03c945607880f076.jpg ",1749077972,

1172470,Apex Legends™: Prodigy Patch Notes,"ANTI-CHEAT Before we jump into the seasonal updates, here’s a quick progress check-in on anti-cheat. We’ve been focusing on many iterative improvements across an array of efforts including internal cheat detection, automated detections, and third party solutions. Our ongoing work against teaming has continued to have a positive impact on bad behaviour, primarily in Ranked. We’ve also ramped up efforts combating bot activity performed by automating certain devices, and a decrease in nefarious bot activity should already be noticeable in your matches by the time you read this. This population may be small, but their actions can still disrupt your time in the Outlands and we’re continuing to target actions against these players to ensure that every match is worthwhile. There’ve also been a plethora of improvements that we’re looking to actively update ranging from bug/exploit fixes to hardening existing prevention measures; we hope to share more on these in the future. Finally, we wanted to thank you for the feedback on our mid-season addition of Report Action Feedback. Please continue to submit in-game reports as they do work both in identifying cheaters and the impact they’re having in your matches. AUDIO As part of our ongoing efforts to improve audio reliability, we have implemented a system that will allow us to improve how we diagnose audio issues for our PC players. We will now look out for common symptoms of audio issues (ex. footstep audio events being dropped excessively) throughout your matches. When we detect an abnormally large amount of these situations with in-game audio, we will occasionally offer you the option of uploading a detailed report containing everything our audio engine did throughout the course of your match. Since the scope of this diagnostic information is limited to our audio systems, the uploaded data is completely anonymous; the recording is purely game related audio, and does not contain voice chat nor any information that can be tracked back to you. MATCHMAKING This season, we’re tackling matchmaking quality through region population management, leveraging skill values in Ranked, and by increasing queue wait times for high-skilled lobbies. Population management comes in the form of a system improvement that allows auto-merging of players into higher population regions to expand the pool of available players for closer skill matchmaking. Since the available pool on each platform, in each region, and at any time of day can vary quite a bit, we are testing ways to get those players together without sacrificing too much latency. The next two major changes this season focus on matchmaking quality in Ranked. The first change is how players are reset each season: initial Rank and tier placement is based on the player’s tracked skill value and not how much RP they had at the end of the season. This will group like-skilled players together, even if they haven’t played in a while. Players new to Ranked will receive their initial placement based on their performance in Apex so far. The second change is part of our seasonal tuning for matchmaking which this time around means asking our Platinum, Diamond, and Masters (including Predator) players to wait a bit longer while we try to find them opponents that are closer to their RP value. Skill and RP aren’t the same thing, but they are closer than they have been in the past. LTM: ARENAS Arenas returns at the start of the season to test your skill and cunning in a round-based 3v3 Deathmatch. Experience the classic mode with the latest weapons and Legends. Prepare a loadout at the start of each round, fight your opponents in intense squad battles, and learn your opponents’ weaknesses to prevail.

1172470,New Updates Coming with Apex Legends™: Sparrow,"SPARROW: PRODIGY A seriously skilled, but rarely serious archer enters the Outlands. THE MAN, HIS LEGEND Enea Davide Guarino was born into the most respected bounty hunter clan in the Outlands, the Clessidra Rossa, known for their unparalleled archery skills and dogmatic moral code. Enea was a promising successor for the head of the order, but he refused to see the world in Clessidra Rossa’s binary terms, and as he got older his family grew concerned over his resistance to their views. Being raised by such a tightly-wound group made him restless, often leading him to make reckless decisions. One particular choice created a rift between him and his family, and it became clear they would never see eye to eye. Enea was shunned from his family and the Clessidra Rossa. Enea is heartbroken about leaving his family, but is determined to figure out how to have it all—both a life on his own terms and his family’s acceptance. While bounty hunting on his own to support himself, he’s unexpectedly recruited by Kuben Blisk for the Apex Games—the perfect playground to flex his skills and have fun at the same time. In his heart, Enea hopes that the publicity will help him gain the respect of his family. RECON WITH ITALIAN FLAIR Sparrow is a very agile Legend who can utilize his double jump Passive to get to vantage points quickly, then he’s able to make full use of his Tactical and Ultimate abilities. With his Tactical, you’ll gain knowledge of the battlefield by selecting clever spots. We recommend utilizing these as traps to cover your flank, choke points, or more actively to track a known target. His Ultimate will help your squad control a large area, flushing enemies from cover or denying a potentially fatal push. PASSIVE: DOUBLE JUMP Press jump while in the air to jump again. You can also press jump while climbing to launch Sparrow up walls to gain height quickly. He can also carry additional arrows and explosive arrows for the Bocek. TACTICAL: TRACKER DART Shoot a tracker from your gauntlet to reveal enemies who walk within its line of sight. Tracker darts can be placed on most surfaces, and enemies will be revealed by a trail that can be seen through walls. If any enemy is over 40 meters away there will be a distance marker over their head. These darts can also be used to activate Survey Beacons from afar. ULTIMATE: STINGER BOLT Shoot a large arrow that anchors where it lands. Once charged up, it will damage anyone within its range, causing damage and slowing any opponent it hits. Getting behind cover, leaving the zone, or shooting the arrow are the options enemies have when they find themselves caught in Sparrow's ultimate. LEGEND UPGRADES Upgrades Level 2 Extra Traps: Gain an additional Tac charge and +2 traps in world Hunt Target: Sparrow gets a speed boost when running towards a marked enemy Upgrades Level 3 Alternate Mode: Ult now has 3 charges that fire fewer pulses in a smaller radius Life Siphon: Sparrow's health and shields are recovered if enemies are damaged by his Ult LAUNCH CHALLENGES Step into Sparrow’s shoes for yourself while he’s unlocked for all from May 6-20, 2025. Launch Challenges will take place in two batches over the first four weeks of the season with tests to your Legend ability, weapon flexibility, and damage capability. First round: May 6-20, 2025 PT Permanently unlock Sparrow & earn additional rewards Legend and Weapon challenges Second round: May 20-June 3, 2025 PT Legend and Damage challenges Earn a variety of rewards GET THE LOOK Get ready with Sparrow with a style fit for a Legend in the launch store.

1172470,APRIL 2025: AWS SERVER MIGRATION,"We wanted to share an update about a recent behind-the-scenes change we’ve made to improve your experience in Apex Legends. As a long-term investment in the tech powering Apex, we’ve officially migrated our game servers to Amazon GameLift Servers. This partnership gives us more flexibility to identify and address issues across regions, ultimately helping us deliver a more consistent experience over time. It’s worth noting that every player's connection is unique, and no single change will affect everyone the same way. But this move gives us stronger tools to dig into specific problem areas and, where possible, make improvements. One early sign of progress: we've seen a noticeable drop in game server performance degradation, things like rubberbanding and hit registration issues. Post-migration, matches experiencing these issues have decreased. While this impacts a relatively small percentage of total matches, it's a meaningful step forward. To celebrate the move and thank you for being part of this journey, we’ve lined up some fun things for you: April 17–24: 1.5x XP on all sources April 17–24: 2x XP when playing in a party April 18–20: Double Battle Pass Stars on Weeklies Thanks as always for playing, and we’ll keep you updated as we continue to invest in the future of Apex. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b79baa9673482749c2e6c8768fab9614ce77c715.jpg",1744909357,['patchnotes']
