After years in the making, the team behind one of the best indie games of all time says that it's ""more likely"" the overhaul will land in January, but there's still a chance we could have it in our hands before the end-of-year holidays.

A very Happy Thanksgiving to each and every one of you! Our teams are taking a small break today and tomorrow to spend time with friends and family (and generous helpings of turkey, dressing, and more). Of course, Christmas and the busy shopping season lurks right around the corner as well - so much going on all at once! It goes without saying that we are beyond thankful for the support you all show us each and every day. Even on the most difficult of days, it is that support that makes it all worthwhile. You make all of this possible, and we never forget that. We also know it has been overlong with the Terraria 1.4.5 dev cycle, but we are getting closer and closer each and every day. Thank you for your patience there. Let's settle in and see what this month's State of the Game feast has in store... PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - RACING THE CLOCK TOWARDS SUBMISSIONS Greetings, Terrarians! Another month has flown by and the team has made some great strides towards the completion of Terraria 1.4.5. Localization work (at least in regards to the PC side of things) has pretty much been completed at this point - outside of a few stragglers that we may just take care of within a post-release hotfix. Outside of that, the team has been hard at work testing and fixing bugs as well as coordinating with all of our various global partners to try and get everyone as far advanced as possible in parallel. We have not yet reached the point of making first party submissions, but we should hopefully be there soon. We will try to let everyone know once those submissions are in, at which point things will be mostly out of our control. We do have guesstimates about how long that will take based on past rounds, but we have seen it go way faster and way slower before so you never know. Timing-wise, the launch window remains the same - though January is more likely at this point unless we get lucky with faster-than-expected submissions. We will try our very best to continue to narrow that window down as we know more. We should know a LOT more once we get the first round of submissions out of the way. The reality is that first party staff go home for the holidays eventually - at which point we are stuck waiting on them to return. We are racing that clock to at least get our first round of submissions in and done this year. If we get first-pass approval, December remains possible. If not... then it's probably January. We are trying to be as transparent with the process as we can here - we know it has been a long time coming, so we owe you that much. Now, we wouldn't want to leave you empty-handed spoiler-wise either, so we have what we think is a really cool one for this month - a revamped crafting UI! This new take on the crafting interface blends what has worked so well in regards to research and duplication on Journey Mode and brought it over into the mainstream crafting process. These changes also apply to the Guide recipe interface. This means you will be able to sort through the sometimes-daunting pile of possible crafting recipes for any given material via both categorical tabs and even a text-based search box. This becomes all the more important with the changes to craft from nearby chests that will arrive with Terraria 1.4.5... Taking all of this together, we hope this helps everyone to be able to more quickly find and craft that one perfect item that they want more quickly! (This is still undergoing some tweaks as we find and fix bugs/issues in the testing process so its final form may differ) https://i.imgur.com/eSzG1tH.gif The next generation Terraria Crafting is here! All that said, we always do step back reflect at this time of year on how thankful we are for everyone in our amazing community - you truly are the engine that makes Terraria go. You are the soul of what makes Terraria what it is and what it will become in the future. We are in awe of your creativity and passion around this video game that our small team works on every day. There is so much darkness in the world today, it is refreshing to know that we can all rally around and enjoy a game of Terraria together. Here's to many more years of that to come. So, thank you - a thousand times thank you - for your support over the years, today, and in the years to come. Cheers! STEAM WORKSHOP NEWS Click the banner above to check out the Terraria Workshop!

Halloween has always been one of our favorite times of the year - especially when we get to see all of the crazy costumes, creepy decorations, and creative pumpkins that Terrarians put together each year. So, whether you entered the annual Halloween Contest or not... please be sure to share your spookiest creations with us! On the development side of things, we do have some more clarity on timing to share this month. There are still a lot of moving parts involved that could adjust things, but it is starting to feel like we know the general boundaries. More on that in a bit. For now, let's get set to dive into another month of Terraria news... Trick or treat! PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - TESTING AND LOCALIZATION AND SUBMISSION PLANNING, OH MY!​ Hello again, everyone. Last month, we shared that we were quite close to the content complete/Release Candidate stage. Things are still looking pretty decent in that regard, enough so that parallel beta testing is underway on most platforms so that we can go ahead and capture and fix bugs as they arrive rather than a strictly sequential process. Additional work has been underway this month focused on localization - not only for the new content, but also weaving in three new languages and the localization community review conducted over the past year or so. This should ulimately yield better translations for existing content that more accurately take game context into account. We are also thrilled to at long last be able to provide Terraria in Korean, Japanese, and Traditional Chinese. This area of game development is often more complex than it seems, so we are very glad that it is NEARLY done! That leads us to the third topic - one that we all know and love - planning for things like first party submissions and any additional work needed by our global partners in order to enable a global sync launch. To put it mildly and not to bore anyone with the details, there are a LOT of moving parts and interdependencies that we have to manage in this process. It is also not a very quick system to navigate and it comes with a lot of unknowns (you can never say what a given first party might take issue with... requiring additional fixes... and another round of submissions). We do have a plan in place, if all goes perfectly to schedule, for when those submissions might occur. Beyond that, it is honestly a wild card as to how long it takes - a wild card with some reasonable boundaries, but still a wild card. Toss in the Holidays for everyone involved (e.g. at some point, the first party reviewers are gone for the year), and it gets even messier. With all of that said, we are realistically looking at a launch window for Terraria 1.4.5 that is between mid December and the end of January. It is impossible to predict at this point where things will fall in that window. There are far too many moving parts that could break either for us or against us to say at this time. However, we do feel good about the time window itself. Again, we are very aware that this update has taken far too long to reach completion - all we can do is share our apology for that time span and just know that we are doing our best to get it out as quickly as we can. We also cannot wait to share the plans for the future as well, once the update is out and all fixed up post launch. STEAM WORKSHOP NEWS Click the banner above to check out the Terraria Workshop!

On November 1st the monthly update release of tModLoader will go live. As always we are grateful for the massive amount of community participation in developing and testing new features each month.

If you are interested in participating in the next mod jam, be sure to come to Discord to be notified. This month's release contains mostly bug fixes and smaller features. We've fixed several UI inconsistencies, fixed a major sound volume issue, and even fixed major issues with how liquids are drawn, especially around sloped tiles.

We have one foot already into the Fall season - our favorite season of the year! - and we are drawing ever closer to the release of Terraria 1.4.5. More on that below. We are also getting really close to the release of the Terraria Board Game in November. The end of the year is setting up to be quite eventful indeed! We are also already setting the stage for what lies ahead in 2026 - Terraria's 15th Anniversary year. We hope we can bring some more cool stuff your way as a result of those plans, but that will have to wait for another day. For now, let's dive in to the latest and greatest news in the world of Terraria! What's in store this time... PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - THE FIX IS IN (PROGRESS)​ The team has been hard at work this month, aiming to reach the ""content complete"" (also known as the Release Candidate) stage within the next couple of weeks. What does that mean, exactly? Well, that means that - at that point - we will have officially added all of the new content/features/etc. that will make it into Terraria 1.4.5. After that, all that is left to do is testing, tweaking, and bug fixing. Of course, that testing/fixing process takes a good amount of time and is somewhat unpredictable (we had some pretty nasty tickets emerge just this past week, for example). Once we reach ""content complete"" and we have a bit of time to focus on fixing, we should have a much better sense of precisely when Terraria 1.4.5 will reach completion. We are working as closely as possible with our partners in parallel to try and shorten the time needed on the backend for first party submissions, localization, etc. - as, again, our goal for 1.4.5 is a global synchronized launch. All that said, reaching content complete is a major milestone and we are truly at the final stages now. We know this update has taken far too long to get out to you all, and we are sorry for that. We do hope that you enjoy it once it is out - and that you are excited for what else is in store for the future of Terraria. More on that in the months ahead. For now, we are all in on the push to get this update out to you as quickly as possible! This month's spoiler looks at some improvements to the way NPC Housing operates and is communicated to the player... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/e391dae59456ffd1ede440abc751e91d750d1d45.png Villagers no longer require a House in order to appear!

This month's release contains the new ModAchievement feature. We are excited to see how mods use ModAchievement and how they'll give players long-term goals to work towards. We've seen many mod makers showcasing their new achievement art this last month and look forward to seeing them in-game. As usual, we'd like to encourage modders to test out new tModLoader features on the preview branch if they are relevant to your mod. Major features in preview are listed on our Discord.

We are well into the final push for Terraria 1.4.5 (for real, more on that below), and tickets are flying through the system. Several members of the team were also able to get together in person this month for the first time in many years - and for the first time ever with some folks. We have also been able to take care of a lot of planning for ""what comes next"" that will hopefully make for more consistency down the line. More on that in the future. With that said, we are all back home and ready to push this over the line. Let's get right into it, shall we? PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME NOW​ The Re-Logic team sat down this past month for one last parsing of the list of items remaining. Some things were deferred and others prioritized - all in an effort to arrive at something we have been looking forward to for quite a while: an internal launch window. Up until this point, the timing has been somewhat fluid based on additional content needs and unexpected bugs and such. We are not quite ready to share that timeline publicly just yet, but we have informed all of our internal partners (DR Studios, etc) of the plan so that we can work together to make this happen. More than ever before with 1.4.5, this is truly the final push. Speaking of the release of Terraria 1.4.5, we are hoping for and planning on this being a global launch. What that means is that we are aiming to release on all platforms at or around the same time. That includes PC, Consoles, Mobile, China Mobile, etc. We are considering this somewhat of a ""dry run"" for the post-Crossplay world - which is something we hope to bring to fruition in very short order once 1.4.5 is out and all hotfixes are done. This requires a lot of coordination and planning for things like localization and submissions. As mentioned above, that process is well underway. Happy to answer questions from anyone as we can, but things are really coming into focus now... As for spoilers this month, the team thought it might be fun to look at some of the unsung work that goes into these updates. Bug fixes, tweaks, and changes that may not have a lot of visual flash and sizzle, but certainly impact the Terraria experience. We've shared an example below: Ticket TER-2230 - ""Better convey the existence of player defense multipliers in Expert/Master+ worlds"" The issue at play here is that Player Defense in Expert and Master+ worlds is subject to defense values being multiplied by 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, but this information is never conveyed to the player, resulting in players mistakenly believing defense becomes less and less valuable as the world difficulty increases. This leads to players making suboptimal build decisions. However, just increasing the defense number also can create confusion, so there needs to be some way to communicate both the increase effect and the fact that it is tied to a given difficulty level. Lots of ideas and discussions then occur - do you just increase the numbers, do you do a hover-over tooltip, maybe a graphic element, etc. - until we arrive at a final decision, shown below: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/f48b01876cf72e5fb4027efbb5385ccb366d7c46.gif In 1.4.5, the Defense Shield shape and colors change along with providing an explanation for how much damage is mitigated for that level of Defense on a given difficulty. There are countless little things like the above that go into each update - alongside the bugs that we all know and hate being squashed underfoot. Speaking of bugs, nearly 900 bugs have been closed during the development process of 1.4.5! Again, we are in the final push now. The content list is locked in, the bug and ticket list is locked in and the internal timeline is set. We are hopeful that we will be able to share something more publicly soon! RE-LOGIC x GAMESCOM Last week, a handful of the Re-Logic team met up at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany. What started as ""Loki needs to go to Gamescom to handle some meetings and business-y stuff"" turned into an opportunity for about half of our team to meet up with each other in person. This was the first time we have had even this many team members in one place since 2018 - and it was the first time for a lot of us to meet the wonderful @Kazzymodus ! Meetings were had, sights were seen, and the team reveled in the chance to connect with each other in a way that only being together in person can accomplish. We also had the chance to meet some of our favorite partners and developer friends for the first time. This was far, far overdue and we are already looking forward to the next time! We thought it might be fun to share a few pictures from our adventures.

This month has seen quite a bit of effort focused on one of the new unique World Seeds. It is indeed a pesky one, given the odd ways it seems to interact with the worldgen. We are not quite ready to dive into the details of that one just yet, so you will have to remain in the dark for now. As to what we do have to show this month...

105600,Huge new Palworld update makes Terraria inspired raid boss even more powerful,"There's just something about collectables in videogames that scratches an itch for me. Whether it's monsters, mascots, or mates, I can't help but spend hours unearthing hidden characters or unseen achievements. Pocketpair's popular <strong>Palworld</strong> is just one of many games that's effectively captured the buzz of creature collecting, because there really is no better feeling than farming with your Pals.

Well, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. All hands remain on deck in regards to Terraria development. To get the tough part out of the way first, we still do not have a release date to give out. Every day is one day closer, of course, but we are trying to remain overly cautious and conservative in regards to giving out any timing. We do not want to repeat the mistake of giving out a timing window and then have things change and it not be accurate. So, we must once again ask for your continued patience as we do the hard work that needs to be done in order to ensure a quality update for everyone. Short of pushing crunch time on the team (which we are not going to do), things are proceeding as fast as they can at this point. With that said, we have a few fun spoilers this month that we hope everyone will enjoy. So, without further ado... Let's see what is in store this month! PC - RE-LOGIC NEW TRAPPINGS FOR HOME SWEET HOME... AND A LITTLE PALWORLD TEASER​ We have a pair of topics to cover in spoiler-land this month. First off, we have a handful of new furniture sets coming with the update - providing even more ways for players to customize their abode, arenas, and more. To give you a quick glimpse at what all goes into each of these sets, here is an advance look at the new Hallowed Furniture Set: https://i.imgur.com/ImL2PTl.gif I feel more regal somehow just for looking at it... We may show off a few more of these little additions if time allows - but we hope this at least gives you a sense for one small addition coming with Terraria 1.4.5. In case you missed it, the Palworld side of the Palworld x Terraria crossover launched yesterday. Dubbed ""Tide of Terraria"", this latest update brings the world of Terraria into the Palworld universe... and much more!

You can pick up a copy of Palworld - and check out the latest news on the Palworld front via the link below: PALWORLD - OFFICIAL SITE --- WHAT ABOUT THE TERRARIA SIDE? This, of course, begs the obvious question of ""what about Palworld content coming to Terraria?"" We can confirm a few things on that front. One, there will be Palworld content in Terraria.

105600,The Terraria 1.4.5 update introduces new weapons from its most iconic foe,"Somehow, <strong>Terraria 1.4.5</strong> keeps getting bigger. The long-awaited 'final update' for one of the best-selling games of all time is creeping gradually towards us. But developer Re-Logic hasn't left us hanging. The end of the month means the Terraria State of the Game for May 2025, and with it come fresh 1.4.5 spoilers. This time, we've got two new weapons that should make the early game feel a lot more dynamic, and also prove particularly welcome for those who enjoy modes such as Skyblock. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/1-4-5-update-slime-weapons"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/cryptmaster/anniversary-update"">Dramatic dungeon crawler Cryptmaster celebrates anniversary with a hefty upgrade</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/islands-and-trains/cozy-rail-building-game"">New city builder Islands and Trains is a relaxing alternative to Cities Skylines</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/reforj/update-corner-sculpting"">Spiritual Minecraft successor Reforj transforms building tools in first update</a> ",1748611130,

Time is really flying this year - or maybe it's just us? Terraria turned 14 years old this month, which is crazy to think about - a massive thanks to each and every one of you for your support over the years! Anyway, another month of progress is in the books and the concerted effort (and extra hands on deck) towards tackling tickets is already paying off. Our rate of working through these has accelerated noticeably. There is still a good ways to go, but we are very pleased with the pace. We know that everyone is desperately wanting a release window. We discuss this very topic on a regular basis - ultimately, we don't want to ever cut corners, and we want to be very sure of any date/timing we give whenever it is ready for prime time... so just hang in there with us a bit longer. We know this update has taken a long time, and we thank you for that patience you show each month. That said, let's dive into the latest and greatest, shall we? https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC SLIME - NOT JUST FOR BREAKFAST ANYMORE!​ Often, early game Terraria can feel a bit limiting in regards to gear choices. Sure, you will eventually find enough ore to slap together a cool new sword, or perhaps luck will favor you with a shiny drop from a chest hidden near the surface... but outside of getting desperate and turning to Wood gear, what choice do you have? This becomes even more of a factor on World Seeds with limited resources, such as Skyblock. What if you could craft a nice early weapon out of the most common enemy that roams the plains and forests of Terraria - the humble slime? Well, in Terraria 1.4.5 you will be able to take some of that extra Gel and form it up into one of two new early game weapons: the Slime Spear and Slime Whip! These weapons will also inflict the Slime debuff on enemies. This will make them both easier to keep track of - and (also new to 1.4.5), more susceptible to fire! This makes for a nice one-two punch alongside some fire arrows, Wand of Sparking, or anything else that can inflict On Fire! This will also make these Slimy weapons a bit more ""interesting"" in multiplayer situations... https://i.imgur.com/GIX22Yo.gifLet's just hope Baby Slime doesn't ask what that whip is made of... https://i.imgur.com/qWtzjNY.gif Now you're cooking with Slime! In case you missed it, we also released Terraria 1.3.0.8 as a beta branch on Steam in celebration of Terraria's 14th Anniversary.

The catch? They would be tethered together and playing on hardcore. Any death from either player would end the run. What new spoilers appeared? What development insights did Redigit reveal? What sorts of crazy shenanigans did they get up to? Most importantly - how did it end!?! Terraria - still bringing players closer together than ever before after all of these years! So, we hope that everyone enjoys that fun little journey into the world of Terraria 1.4.5 - we wish there could have been more, but sadly two seasoned Terraria pros got taken out by... a waterfall.

We know that this update has taken a very long time and we appreciate your patience more than we can say. Please just hang in there with us a bit longer. With that said, let's get right to it! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA - BRINGING BACKGROUNDS TO THE FOREGROUND​ One of the long-running aspects of the upcoming Terraria update has been the development of a whole new suite of biome backgrounds. Hand-crafted by Luna (also known as RunicPixels), these deceptively detailed works of art really set the mood and keep things fresh as you explore each Terraria world. We are showing just a few examples below, but we have several others already completed and ready for prime time. Make sure that you take the time to look closely and take each of these all in.... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/78e7adc579f9df445a4bc1a0b00095fec2e324db.pngFairy Circles, Ancient Bones, Frozen Rivers, and Gnarled Corrupt Trees, oh my!

A Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to each and every one of you from Team Terraria! We hope that everyone has found ample time to spend with family and friends during this time. That has been the focus of our team over the past couple of weeks - a good chance to rest and recharge for the push into what is to come in 2025. That said, we did take a few days away from the holiday celebrations for a quick playthrough on the new Skyblock seed. As with all of our playthroughs, shenanigans quickly followed: dev duels, Chippy vs Red for the CEO crown, even what has come to be known as ""debug command battles"" commenced over the course of the adventure. These are always not only a lot of fun, but also beyond useful in assisting with bug fixing and balance. We can't wait to see what you make of this seed when the update drops! Let's see what is under the Terraria tree this year, shall we? https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA - FLOORS? WHERE WE'RE GOING WE WON'T NEED FLOORS...​ As we mentioned in the introduction to this month's State of the Game, most of the team has been on Holiday break, spending time with family, getting some home projects done, things like that. Of course, then there is the madness that has been the Skyblock playthrough. Our goal with the Skyblock seed is to take a game format that is somewhat notorious for being grindy and for experts only and to make it at least a bit more approachable/accessible to a broader audience of players. As such, a lot of our time on this session was focused around balance (and bugs, of course). Skyblock is sort of its own set of rules and such, so a lot of care has to be taken to make sure it feels right. That said, we had our usual share of trolling and craziness. The CEO crown changed hands more times than we can count via a variety of 1:1 duels between devs, testers, and more. We had more fun and insightful chats than we could recall in a long time - both trips down memory lane and gazing into the future. That said, we thought we might share a screen or two from our playthrough world just for your viewing pleasure. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/5ae9d99efc325acfb16d4970ca73cc347a133131.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/3be77fb37911ac739dd0b06abf9730895fdedc4f.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/fcc8b6a83dcc07f4de84faf117882636d68dc126.png --- TERRARIA 1.2.4.1 IS NOW AVAILABLE ON STEAM {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/1dd357d39f86dd6469a827127dc6c9ace9a9e62c.png Yes, this is the actual banner from the 1.2.4 launch...

The work on the final lists from each dev team member is nearing its conclusion, which is a great measure of progress. That said, we are pretty certain that there is no way that we will see Terraria 1.4.5 release this year. To make a long story short, end-of-year releases (especially if you are trying to sync launch across PC-Mobile-Console AND do so globally at the same time) are fraught with peril due to review cycles, people leaving early for the holidays, etc. The hope was that we would be able to get things in ahead of that end of year mess, but that isn't looking to be the case. We are also not going to force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch for what would be an arbitrary deadline. So, that said, the next Terraria update is moving along into 2025. We are sure that will not be welcome news for many - but we remain committed to being a quality-first studio, so we will take the time necessary for each update to feel ""just right""... and we think that once the update is out, everyone will appreciate that time and care.

105600,Terraria 1.4.5 update makes reforging your best gear a lot less scary,"Each tiny addition revealed for the <strong>Terraria 1.4.5</strong> update makes me even more excited for its impending arrival. Developer Re-Logic is continuing its trend of turning a proposed minor set of tweaks into a full-blown, comprehensive overhaul filled with upgrades and new items. In its Terraria State of the Game for October 2024, head of business strategy Ted 'Loki' Murphy rounds out the spookiest month of the year with a handful of fresh spoilers for one of the best PC games of all time. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/1-4-5-update-jungle-juice-reforging"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/map"">Terraria map size, biomes, and how they work</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/mods-best"">The best Terraria mods 2024</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/1-4-5-update-weather-rework"">Terraria 1.4.5 makes weather much more dramatic and dangerous</a> ",1730461428,

October is quite possibly our favorite month here on the Terraria team. We are big fans of the turn towards the Fall alongside all of the spooky happenings that come along with Halloween. Speaking of which, if you have any amazing Terraria-themed pumpkins, costumes, or anything similar that you put together for Halloween this year, we would love to see them - and maybe feature them in the community section next month! On the development side, the team is pushing hard towards the end of the year, checking off items on the team's collective list at a blistering pace. More on that later, but for now, let's see what treats the Terraria team has waiting for our amazing community this year! All that said, let's see what's going on in the world of Terraria... https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA - LIFE FRUIT HAS GOT WHAT ADVENTURERS CRAVE The team has been making some amazing progress on the ""lists"" we mentioned in September's State of the Game. There is still quite a bit to get done (and test and fix, etc), but we remain committed to never cutting any corners. Ultimately, updates will take the time they need to be done right - that mantra of ""it's ready when it's ready"" has served us, the game, and the community right for 13 years and counting after all! As for what that means for timing and whatnot, we cannot really say just yet. That said, we will be sure to keep everyone informed here in the SOTG as well as elsewhere when the time is right. Thank you for your patience and your support! Speaking of your support, we are thrilled to reveal that Terraria has finally eclipsed the 60 million units milestone (60.7m to be precise) - with 33m on PC alone! Simply put, we could not do what we do every day while maintaining the principles we hold so dearly without your support. Thank you doesn't do it justice - rest assured we aim to keep being worthy of that support. Life Fruit has always been a valuable commodity in Terraria - but really loses its usefulness once the player has reached full health. The scientists in the Terraria food labs have taken some steps to fix this problem. Let's check in with our resident food expert to find out more... Check out the Console/Mobile section for a sneak peak of Jungle Juice in action! Oh, and in case you missed it, we had a sneaky little hidden spoiler posted on TCF during the TCF 10th Anniversary Festivities: https://i.imgur.com/Zdsgvmy.gif Avoid that nasty ""one click too many"" - and giving the Tinkerer even more of you hard-earned coins... https://i.imgur.com/CicmbR2.png STEAM WORKSHOP NEWS - DEVELOPER'S CHOICE https://i.imgur.com/4Wu7N7y.png Click the banner above to check out the Terraria Workshop!

The tModLoader team and our amazing community of contributors continues to improve tModLoader. On November 1st the monthly update release of tModLoader will go live. Once again this month's release contains many improvements to the user experience, some gameplay bug fixes, as well as new features with examples and documentation for mod makers. We'd like to remind modders about the preview branch where we test new features before they arrive in stable the following month. Modders interested in new these features, listed both on our GitHub and in the #preview-update-log of our Discord, can join the preview branch to get early access to the new features and test them in their mods. We really appreciate the feedback from modders using the preview branch to try out the new features. One feature we are currently previewing is additional support for modded tiles that react to wind and player movement, as some vanilla tiles do. Modders on the preview branch can test it out and make sure it works correctly for chandeliers, banners, vines, and other similar tiles. Modders and users should also keep an eye out for our monthly Steam announcement on the 1st where a complete listing of bug fixes and API changes for this month's release will be listed.

For several members of the team, this is their favorite time of the year - Halloween decorations are already starting to go up! Speaking of, we hope everyone is already coming up with ideas for cool Terraria pumpkin carvings, costumes, and art because we always love to see them. In the meantime, the teams remain hard at work on adding/tweaking/fixing content for Terraria 1.4.5. The finish line is starting to take shape, though we admittedly do have a couple of decent-sized ideas we want to discuss internally and decide if we should take those on before we can say for certain. How's that for vague? All that said, we are pretty excited for what is in Terraria 1.4.5 already, what we know is still to be added, and what may or may not be yet to come. Just a little while longer... All that said, let's see what's going on in the world of Terraria... https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA - WHITTLING DOWN THE FINAL LISTS As we mentioned in the opening of the State of the Game, the team has the final list in-hand - as well as a few possible additional things that we might include, which we will decide in the next couple of weeks - and is hard at work with getting all of that content together. Terraria 1.4.5 has turned into quite an update, far exceeding our initial intent to ""just do the Dead Cells content"". We know the update process has been longer than usual (or anyone expected), but the end is in sight and we hope that it will not be too much longer before we can get and give a sense for timing. We had a few spoilers in mind for this month, but none of them really felt right and/or are things we may not want to spoil at all before the update drops. So, that being the case, no spoilers from the PC side this month, I'm afraid. Of course, it is always a good time to look back on the tons of spoilers given for this update thus far - even we were floored by what all has been shared so far! Oh, and if you haven't checked out Core Keeper yet, you should - the team at Pugstorm are good people and they have created a pretty fun game! https://i.imgur.com/CicmbR2.png STEAM WORKSHOP NEWS https://i.imgur.com/4Wu7N7y.png Click the banner above to check out the Terraria Workshop!

As the month comes to a close, the Terraria State of the Game for August 2024 has arrived, bringing with it fresh new spoilers for one of the best-selling PC games ever made.

That may have set the record for the fastest-feeling Summer of all time. We hope everyone at least got a chance to grab some fun times with friends and family over the past few months - before we all plunge headlong into what Fall has in store. On the Terraria front, we are full speed ahead in the second half of the year, with development of 1.4.5 still going quite well (we are nearing the 50th beta of this dev cycle!). Each month sees the addition of even more cool stuff - we are particularly excited for what was added this month, though we are only going to spoil one of the more ""shocking"" tidbits for now. We know everyone wants that juicy release date still, but we are patiently working through our list of ""to do's"", and we do not want to ever cut any corners... so it will still be a bit longer, I'm afraid. With that out of the way... let's take a look at a particularly intriguing State of the Game! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA - WEATHERING THE STORM While Terraria has had various weather effects for quite some time, they have mostly been cosmetic. Outside of wind - which can impact movement and projectiles - and possibly the visibility-limiting blizzard/sandstorms, weather has never really played a huge role in the Terraria adventure. Terraria 1.4.5 aims to change that up a bit by not only adding some new natural/weather phenomenons, but also making some weather elements more... interactive. Remember, if you feel your hair standing on end, it may be time to seek shelter indoors! How shocking! What other goodies have the team added this month? Well, be sure to check out the Console/Mobile section for at least one more spoiler... but as always, some things will remain a secret.

As you all know, we cannot say enough about how much we appreciate the members of our community. In addition, we have always tried our best to be a charity-minded company. With that as background, we are beyond thrilled to share that we are partnering with the Make-A-Wish® Foundation to make a young Terrarian's wish come true! Make-A-Wish® New Jersey contacted us a few months ago to share that they had a huge Terraria fan whose biggest wish we could help make a reality. Of course, we jumped at the chance to make this happen and we were quickly introduced to Frank. Frank is a 17-year-old teenager from Rockaway, New Jersey who is battling a critical illness. Frank declared to Make-A-Wish® New Jersey that his one true wish was to have his own Vanity Set in Terraria. Since then, we have been working closely with Frank to bring this Vanity Set to life - from initial concepts to various iterations to adding flavor text and more, it has been a real honor and pleasure to work hand-in-hand with Frank to make his dream a reality. He is certainly a Terrarian, through and through! With all that said, we are pleased to be able to reveal Frank's Vanity set, which will be coming everyone's way with the Terraria 1.4.5 update...

We haven't fully sorted out how this will be toggled just yet, but we will in time. As always, there may be further tweaks and such to this set and the shader before it goes live in Terraria 1.4.5, but we didn't want to wait any longer to share it with all of you! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png We also sent Frank a little Terraria swag... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/16d08c65e34a7af9257139a687f07a8d0d008d8b.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/70fdd7262408be49e38c44dbf83829169fa533f2.jpg Huge thanks go out to Frank, Make-A-Wish® New Jersey, the entire Terraria dev team, and our very own Jaxrud🌳 who took on the monumental task of fulfilling this wish. We cannot wait to see Frank's reaction when he gets a chance to dive into Terraria with his very own Vanity Set later this year! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png ABOUT MAKE-A-WISH® NEW JERSEY {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/146b26167919dae1d951f12c34e2c2dedac26915.png Make-A-Wish® New Jersey creates life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. In the fight against a critical illness, a wish serves as a catalyst for renewed strength and encouragement for every child and family on their journey. A wish helps kids look past their limitations, families overcome anxiety and entire communities experience joy. Most importantly, wishes can improve a child’s quality of life. We believe a single wish transforms lives. With their national headquarters based in Phoenix, Arizona, Make-A-Wish® is one of the world’s leading children’s charities, with 57 chapters serving children in every community in the United States and its territories, and nearly 40 international affiliates. Make-A-Wish® New Jersey was founded in 1983. Serving children in every municipality in the Garden State, Make-A-Wish® New Jersey has granted nearly 12,000 wishes since its inception.

We are greatly enjoying the warmer temperatures and the chance to get outside a lot more. Of course, development work remains at a steady pace as we draw ever-closer to Terraria 1.4.5. In the meantime, we hope that you enjoyed the 13th Anniversary celebration (and re-release of 1.1) earlier this month... and that you are looking forward to the upcoming board game as much as we are! 2024 is nearly half-done, and we are quite excited about what the rest of the year has in store for Terrarians everywhere. With that out of the way, let's dip our toes into this month's pool of Terraria news! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - THE RE-LOGIC FAMILY GROWS! The Re-Logic team is beyond ecstatic to reveal that our little dev team family has grown by two with the official addition of jopojelly and Kazzymodus! Just who are these new Re-Logic team members and what will/have they be working on? Let's find out! KAZZYMODUS Kazzymodus has been a beta-tester for Terraria for more than five years, having experienced the development of 1.4 - still known as 1.3.6 at the time - onward first-hand from start to soon-to-be finish. During that time they've tested a great deal of content, weeding out a lot of issues before it ends up in your collective hands, as well as giving feedback and suggestions to make sure any new (and old!) content is the best it can be. Now in charge of Quality Assurance, they're doing their best to make your 1.4.5 experience as smooth and bug-free as possible! --- JOPOJELLY Jopojelly became involved in tModLoader during its infancy and quickly became integral in making mods and adding new features to tModLoader. He has always strived to make the experiences of both using mods and making mods better. Rather than make new content himself, jopojelly focused on guiding millions of tModLoader players in experiencing modded content through his quality of life mods Recipe Browser, Boss Checklist, and Census - to name a few. These mods help make players aware of all the awesome bosses, items, and town NPCs added by other mods they have installed so that they can experience them all. Jopojelly will continue to work on collaborating with the tModLoader community on adding new features and bug fixes to tModLoader. https://i.imgur.com/CicmbR2.png UNLEASH YOUR INNER VERMIN VIA THE RAT TRANSFORMATION {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/69f6116c2730f6c500c691441ff431f86c42d104.gif The latest in the handful of transformations coming to Terraria 1.4.5, the Rat Transformation will let you climb walls and squeak into small spaces! https://i.imgur.com/CicmbR2.png TERRARIA TURNED 13 - CHECK OUT THE FIRST FINAL UPDATE! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/9b9af09b0de6d2664860a2e5b654820a1fa19c56.png Don't miss the world premiere of the Wall of Flesh and the horrifying Mech Bosses!

It is humbling to know that our small team has been able to release and support a game as successful as Terraria for all these years. Even more humbling is the unwavering support that each of you have shown us throughout those thirteen years.

These could be broad personal reflections - or even just fun little happenings that occurred along the way over the years. Without further ado, let the storytelling commence! DARTHMORF Hey everyone, I’m ‘darthmorf’ or Sam – some of you may know me as a moderator on the Terraria forums or may have used my Terraria Logo Maker tool. I’ve also been lucky enough to help test early version of the game since around mid 2017 and have had a great time over the years getting to peek behind the curtain and get to know the developers and my fellow testers (and a few other people from the community too!). The group multiplayer playthroughs are so much fun, and I still manage to learn something new about the game every time I play ... between the many many deaths that is. Certain moments during testing for both Master Mode and the even harder seed variants like 'For the Worthy' were particularly tough, not to mention the trolling from other members of the testing team and even the developers! I very much empathise with the original 1.3 Expert Mode testers ... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/9570cd4ca2353891b7274631218a1a6d1f772fda.gif We got to see lots of funny, weird and interesting bugs too. I sadly can't mention all of them, but a favourite of mine was the brief period of time when ALL projectiles were affected by wind. It made certain boss fights quite interesting, even if it was totally unplayable! Just don't mention infinite boulders, or the 'Wall of Guide'... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/32c66fa31361575ba6ee98301e53ed5c4967a560.png Hmm, yes this is how you sit in a chair, right? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/ca1581fcbcf384e9ea956f34b6bb24f3cf33522d.gif There seems to be something wrong with this campfire. https://i.imgur.com/7qiXvDx.gif Motion smoothing for teleporting enemies might have been a mistake... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/d0dab6aaa96dc2a2eafdd1d4cb4112e709e02861.gif What do you mean I can't deploy my stool while grappled to a wall!? Another huge highlight of my time was getting to meet up with a few other members of the community, along with some people from Re-Logic, DR Studios and 505 Games back in July 2019. It was truly a blast to hang out in person and I cannot wait until we get to do it next. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/05be7c67fb331b829b2061346b30d4a025381c99.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/e408d6d0620d6b36b67e35817ee2ef5d6f672fef.png I've been a part of this amazing community for a while now, and I'm still blown away by just how friendly and kind everyone is.

We noticed lots of speculation that spring would bring the release of 1.4.5 - sorry to say that those guesses were incorrect.

The team really enjoyed seeing how everyone reacted to last month's spoilers - especially Roller Skates! We have been doing a team and tester playthrough on the Vampire Seed over the past two weeks, and we have an even greater appreciation for these new masters of mobility than ever before. Once you skate your way through the Wall of Flesh fight, you may never go back! As always, these playthroughs generate a ton of notes about balance and new ideas as well as highlighting some nasty bugs that we can then fix along the way. You know, things like ""Oh oops, with the new item stacking feature, you can accidentally reforge multiple items at once... we better fix that before the Goblin Tinkerer gets so rich, he retires."" {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/238dc175af7d9703f6dff731a6490af1067b37a1.png We can think of no better way to spend nearly 9,000 platinum... don't worry, we fixed this already. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/0eadfe24fc1aece6fcd4a916eafb6e8579e45209.jpgOur Vampire playthrough ended as it should... with each of us cooking in the sun, except Redigit, who may or may not be a daywalker...

105600,Terraria: Undeluxe Edition - Out Now!,"We have heard the Terraria Community's cries to bring back the versions of Terraria from long long ago for many years now. Frankly, we appreciate the nostalgia as much as anyone, but to say that the daunting task of trying to remove 13 years of content from the game has held us back from doing so would be a massive understatement! That being said, we are pleased to share with you all that starting today, the Terraria Undeluxe Edition is available for fans everywhere to enjoy! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/d6aeaa2085d0271f65aa6024855fb935d3f7eb28.png Highlights of this massive downdate include: DIG 12 Biomes to explore - who needs locations like the Ice Biome... too darned cold! Be careful not to trip as you leap over single-high blocks Rope? Minecarts? Blocks and platforms will suffice. The Crimson was deemed too nasty and the Hallow too sweet, so they both have been kicked to the curb. Demon Altars (those purple spiky things) are now immortal - resistance is futile! Cacti can and will damage you - I mean they ARE covered in needles after all Built-in Bunny Protection will prevent you from accidental Bunny-cide. Delve deep into caves free from the threat of boulders and traps FIGHT Over 360 items/weapons/armor/etc. to find and craft 45 enemies will seek to defeat you at every turn! Defeat the Goblin Army to obtain the greatest mobility accessory in the game, the Rocket Boots! To maintain accuracy the Scraggler was re-added then promptly removed Four challenging boss encounters await Face the terrifying Final Boss, Skeletron! Challenge the endgame Dungeon for fortune and glory! BUILD All 8 NPCs are now clearly labeled by their role so you don't have to remember that Helen is your Nurse Enjoy the streamlined experience of items without any nasty modifiers - no Goblin Tinkerer to take your hard-earned coins here! Speaking of coins, you are going to need to carry them with you if you want to buy something. Valid housing? Figure it out yourself. Axes are now required to chop up all wood blocks - we don't want any accidents! Chests contain a whopping 20 storage slots for you to stash your piles of loot! Avoid accidentally using items by being sure they are in your hotbar prior to use - waste not, want not! Wire? Where you are going, you won't need wires. Paints? Dyes? Angles and slopes? Who needs that kind of variety in their life? You can only imagine the sheer amount of time and effort it took to remove almost 500 enemies/critters, 21 bosses, 5100 items, 32 NPCs, 14 biomes (and all of the mini-biomes), 82 music tracks, 586 tilesets, and so on. A small price to pay for the awesomeness that is Terraria v1.06! Starting today, you can pick up Terraria Undeluxe Edition at your favorite Steam Store! We know you will join us in enthusiastically welcoming Terraria Undeluxe Edition to the Terraria family of games!",1711991416,['workshop']

Users will see a new menu when joining a multiplayer server if mods need to be reloaded, explaining which mods will be downloaded, enabled, or disabled. Finally, mod loading speed has been improved by roughly 10%. We expect to see faster mod loading times and more consistent syncing of mods in multiplayer.

While it's not a Cult of the Lamb-style sex update (that much has been confirmed; sorry everyone), it seems that one of the other most-requested Terraria features could legitimately be on its way, something that could totally transform how we play the 2011 classic forever. Have you ever wanted to return to old, nostalgic versions of Terraria, and reminisce with some simpler, bygone builds?

We hope that everyone that was interested had a chance to pick up the Terraria x Makeship Hallowed Armor Plush late last year. Those should be shipping out just as soon as Makeship completes manufacturing, etc. In the meantime, we are pleased to reveal the second in our plush armor series with Makeship - Silver Armor! The subject of Terraria's box/cover art for many years, Silver Armor has always been an iconic set - since the very early days of Terraria itself! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/d7723a195e7e022c23e11a6de6cb9cf4976bc9d7.png Casting a shimmer all around from the sun glinting off of its polished surfaces, Silver Armor is the best way to adventure in style early on in the world of Terraria!​ Taken straight from the iconic Terraria cover art, the Terraria Silver Armor plush includes a Silver Pickaxe as well as a Silver Bow – perfect for keeping enemies at bay as you delve deeper in search of ore and treasure. You can always strap the one you are not using to your back for safe keeping. We think it looks pretty awesome - and we hope that you agree. To place your order or to find out more, click the banner/image above or the link below! We are already early in planning on what armor will be next... as well as other ideas. TERRARIA SILVER ARMOR PLUSH - ORDER NOW! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png HOW MAKESHIP CAMPAIGNS WORK​ Makeship utilizes a unique method for determining whether or not a plush gets manufactured and shipped out to players. Essentially, each campaign goes out as a preorder for a set period of time - for this campaign, that will be 21 days - and if the plush orders meet the minimum quantity needed (200), the plush gets made and shipped out to everyone that bought one. If it doesn't hit that level, then no one is out a dime - but sadly, our Silver Armor plush will only ever exist as a concept. The short version: The Silver Armor Plush will be available for preorder from today through the next 21 days If Makeship receives at least 200 preorders, the plush will be manufactured and shipped to customers If it does not hit that threshhold, then the plush will not be made, everyone gets their money back, and we will hope for better results on our next attempt. https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png That's pretty much everything to share on this campaign. We really want to see this one be a smashing success - because we think this plush is really cool, and we are really excited to make more armors in the future. Your support here will tell the tale on both fronts. So, if you like what you see and you think the Silver Armor plush might look great in your collection, pick yours up today! ",1708357524,

One great example is the collection and storage of dropped items, be they something like fallen stars or even an AFK farming setup. The team has introduced the Hopper for that very purpose. Shall we see it in action? Picking up your drops and placing them in chests is SO 1.4.4...

105600,Terraria Makeship Series - Hallowed Armor,"Greetings Terrarians! For a good while, we have seen what the good folks over at Makeship have been doing with plush for some of our favorite games (Spiffo from Project Zomboid) and our favorite creators (Khaios has done several). So, when they reached out to us to see if we might be interested in expanding the Terraria plush lineup in new directions, we thought it sounded like a great idea! Terraria is so full of items, monsters, and more that could make some amazing plushies. What we have planned with Makeship is a series based upon some of the more popular armor sets in Terraria - starting today with the Hallowed Armor! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/39ac65c80febcbfd86ae72089c15cff7854cf5ee.png Crafted from the finest Hallowed Bars and the souls of vanquished mechanical monstrosities, Hallowed Armor protects the hero from all manner of evil that awaits in the world of Terraria!​ Our Hallowed Armor plush comes complete with the legendary sword Excalibur as well as a Pickaxe Axe - the ideal tool for both delving deep underground and gathering wood. You can place one in the hands of the plush and strap the other to its back for safe keeping. We think it looks pretty awesome - and we hope that you agree. Now, we need your support to be sure that our Hallowed friend (and future armor sets and more that we have planned) makes it all the way to production and beyond.

Essentially, each campaign goes out as a preorder for a set period of time - for this campaign, that will be 21 days - and if the plush orders meet the minimum quantity needed (200), the plush gets made and shipped out to everyone that bought one. If it doesn't hit that level, then no one is out a dime - but sadly, our Hallowed Armor plush will only ever exist as a concept. The short version: The Hallowed Armor Plush will be available for preorder from today through the next 21 days If Makeship receives at least 200 preorders, the plush will be manufactured and shipped to customers If it does not hit that threshhold, then the plush will not be made, everyone gets their money back, and we will hope for better results on our next attempt. https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png That's pretty much everything to share on this campaign. We really want to see this one be a smashing success - because we think this plush is really cool, and we are really excited to make more armors in the future. Your support here will tell the tale on both fronts. So, if you like what you see and you think the Hallowed Armor plush might look great in your room or would be an amazing gift for a friend or family member this Holiday season, get your order in today!

We hope that your pumpkin carving, candy collecting, haunted house visiting, and trick or treat preparations have been going quite well. On our end, we have loved seeing the Halloween Contest entries coming in (over 300 entries and counting - you still have time to get your amazing Pumpkins, Costumes, and more in!) while we continue to work away on 1.4.5.

It is also the time of the year where we really start to reflect on how much we appreciate each and every one of you and your support.

It has been another exciting month! On November 1st our monthly update release of tModLoader will go live. This month's release contains fixes for various gameplay inconsistencies with Terraria. Dye visuals, boss item drops, bomb damage, tool speed, and echo coating have all received fixes to match Terraria behavior. We are extremely grateful to the users that reported these issues to us. The mod configuration menu has been reworked to be less confusing for mods with multiple configuration pages. We also have exciting news for modders working in a team. Modders added as a ""Contributor"" to a mod on the Steam workshop will soon be able to publish updates for the mod to the workshop directly. Mods will no longer need to be updated only by the original uploader. Mod owners should take some time this month to ensure that everyone listed as a ""Contributor"" on the Steam workshop for your mod is trustworthy enough for this responsibility. Please remove any contributors that do not meet this standard. The feature for contributor publishing will be active November 21st starting with our preview releases to provide time to act. Please spread the word to other mod teams you know that might not have seen this announcement. We look forward to this feature enabling mods to more reliably update to fix bugs that arise. Modders should also keep an eye out for our Steam announcement on November 1st where a complete listing of API changes this month will be listed.

105600,Terraria creator Andrew Spinks shares idea for a new game,"<strong>Terraria</strong> freaks me out sometimes. On the surface, it's a colorful, serene, innocent-looking game with all the warmth and gentility of a peaceful Minecraft world. Green grass. Blue skies. Just you, the outdoors, and your imagination. But then you dig, and you find yourself fighting gigantic, hideous bosses with names like Wall of Flesh, Brain of Cthulhu, and the Lunatic Cultist. It's a deceptive, dual-natured world where the pastoral rapidly gives way to the nightmarish. After dozens of hours in Terraria, perhaps it would be nice to play something calmer. Sharing a short insight into his game-making ambitions, Terraria's creator Andrew 'Redigit' Spinks says he might one day like to work on precisely that - a chilled game in the style of Clicker Heroes, Cookie Clicker, and the other idle icons. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/new-game"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/halloween"">Trick or Terraria, the spooktacular Halloween contest is back</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/1-4-5-cenaxe-fairy"">Terraria 1.4.5 update lets you sling mud and befriend a developer</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/terraria/unity"">Terraria dev pledges $200,000 to Unity rivals amid fees controversy</a> ",1696944406,

There have been many bug fixes made to tModLoader, but this month's release has a particularly large amount of new functionality for modders to play with. New features include: Support for modded Builders Toggles Modded Emote Bubbles Rubblemaker support Reworked NPC buff immunity system A way to store world header data The long awaited Extra Jump API These latest additions have made their way into tModLoader thanks to the efforts of our amazing community of modders who have been willing to contribute to tModLoader. We always encourage modders to continue contributing features to tModLoader, as there is no better way to ensure that TML continues to grow in ways that will best support future modding efforts. Changes like those listed above allow modders the ability to make things that were previously prohibitively complex to implement. We hope players look forward to mods incorporating these new features and encourage modders to take a moment to test their mods on the preview-v2023.08 Steam branch prior to October 1st to ensure a smooth transition.

Whether you are already back, heading back, or glad to have school way back in your personal rear-view mirror; there is always time for the latest Terraria news! Our teams have been working feverishly all month, adding new goodies to the game and balancing and fixing what already exists. Beyond that, we saw three product launches in the month of August - busy times! You will definitely want to dive deep into this State of the Game, as there is a good bit of juicy and important information to cover. Fall is right around the corner, and it is one of our favorite times of the year. Who knows, maybe we will see a return of the always-popular Terraria Halloween Contest... Without further ado, shall we get right into all things Terraria? https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - TUNES, TIMING, AND NEW ADDITIONS The team playthrough has come and gone. I don't think anyone will soon forget their time in The Mad Realm of Boulders! Fun was had, TONS of notes were taken, and the benefits of this playthrough are already being seen in the work on Terraria 1.4.5. Speaking of time, we have an update on timing for everyone. As we started to check off what work remained on the update, we realized that we would really have been remiss to not cover off some long-standing needs for new music. That's right, Terrarians, the 1.4.5 update will contain several new music tracks by our favorite composer, Scott Lloyd Shelly! How many exactly is still a bit to-be-determined, but we are anticipating at least 5 and maybe more! Want to check one of them out? Of course you do! So, all that said, we mentioned an impact on timing - the production of all of these new tracks takes a good amount of time in composition, review, editing, etc. We are not going to rush Scott while he works on the latest in a long line of Terraria musical masterpieces. So, that means the update is going to take a bit longer to come out than we had originally anticipated. Now, before anyone gets too upset... the team realized that if we are having to wait on this music anyway, why not just keep the update development moving on our end and add even more goodies?! What all will that entail? Well you will have to wait and see - but we have some pretty substantial ideas. How much we can get done will depend on how long the music takes. We are pretty confident everyone will be very happy with what we have in store and will feel like this was extra time well-spent. Can't show you too much too soon, though, so it will all be a mystery for now. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/d19fa0953e0711af34f219e0f5aa9ba189dd671b.png Oh, who are we kidding, you knew we were going to show something new.

We are very excited to be able to at long last share a very unique partnership that has been in the works for some time now - Terraria x Madrinas! That's right, we have been working hand-in-hand with our good friends over at Madrinas to create some unique coffee flavors that we hope everyone will really enjoy! It has been a lot of fun trying out flavors and bouncing ideas off of each other, and we are pretty pleased with how it all turned out. Besides, who doesn't need some extra fuel for those late night (or early morning) Terraria sessions? That one more cave beckons! If you are not familiar with Madrinas, they are a well-known coffee company focused on providing innovative new coffee flavors while using only all-natural ingredients. From Whole Bean to Cold Brew, they aim to have a coffee out there that is right for everyone. All in all, we have two cool flavors to share with you here: one based on everyone's favorite 500 year old nature spirit, the Dryad - and the other seeks to answer the age old question of what exactly does a Pigron taste like? The team at Madrinas has also put together a really cool collector's box set that has both flavors and some other goodies as well. So without further ado, grab your favorite mug or shaker cup and let's dive in to Terraria x Madrinas! As always, simply click on a product image to head on over to purchase that item, and we have listed each of these in our very own Merchandise Hub at Terraria.org/Store. https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/ec5f17ea05fbef04f91ad2b15b5f0f450c4b3ecd.jpg TERRARIA x MADRINAS LIMITED EDITION COLLECTOR'S BOX SET This is the cornerstone of the Madrinas x Terraria collaboration!

We saw the great Tree vs Axe War of the Terrarians take place on Terraria Community Forums as well as all over social media? Which side did you wind up supporting? The good news is that things are back to being nice and peaceful again with the leaders of each side reaching a spruce to end hostilities. The even better news is that we will all get to enjoy a couple of new items as a result! We cannot wait to share what we have in mind there when the time comes. Beyond that, we are hammering out the final bits and going through one of our first team Terraria playthroughs in quite a while. These are always fantastic to do near the end of update development for balance, QA, and even the occasional new idea. We know that everyone really wants a launch date window, but we still are not quite ready to share that at this time. Soon though, hopefully! Let's dive headlong into July's happenings and hints of what is to come in August and beyond! https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png PC - RE-LOGIC TERRARIA 1.4.5 - SEEDS, SEEDS EVERYWHERE ​The team has started the customary group full playthrough that accompanies the end stages of development. These are very important (and fun) sessions, where we unearth any remaining pesky bugs, find anything that feels unbalanced or not fun, and - quite often - come up with some fun new ideas. We have been taking the time to listen to fan requests as well - and one we have heard pretty frequently is a way to see which worlds which characters have visited previously as a method to help know which character goes with which world(s). Players and worlds are also now sorted by most recently played. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3949769/271ccb47cabd7c24976344552b61070c9d3c159c.png The team is also having fun diving into the potential of World Seed combinations. With 128 different possible seed combinations, the team has let its creativity run wild by adding a whole bunch of fun combo effects - some big and some small. This includes at least 2 (and maybe more to come) combos that will substantially change the gameplay experience in unexpected ways. Want an example?

After a lot of testing and changes, we are ready to release this next big version of tModLoader. We have seen significant uptake within the modding community on our 1.4.4-preview Beta, and are looking forward to a smooth transition to the next big stage. A lot of hard work went into this, so a big thank you to everyone involved. Likewise, although 1.4.4 is released from our end, there will still be some mods not yet released on 1.4.4. This may include some popular mods. We anticipate several of these noteworthy mods to release within the few days to follow, and ask for your patience as modders publish their work. For more information on the Jump to 1.4.4 and all that's happening around it, you can read more in our big announcement from earlier this month: tModLoader 1.4.4 Transition Plan We are excited to see our modding community is already more than half way to our 60% porting effort target! As a reminder, we are waiting to changeover tModLoader to 1.4.4 as the default option until the majority of mods have posted a 1.4.4 version. Please note that 1.4.4 will NOT replace 1.4.3. 1.4.3 will continue to be available in full through Steam Beta options, just as 1.3 is today.​ As always, we kindly request that we all respect modders' time and not hassle them about porting to 1.4.4. Please be respectful as we all wrap up this big jump forward. Please stay tuned, and thank you for your patience. Once again, we are excited to bring tModLoader to 1.4.4 age!
