779340,Total War 25th Anniversary Showcase,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39760201/2f0e52e3db666839d2da5034f87c33a9fbdf434c.png Total War Community, That’s a wrap on our 25th Anniversary Showcase – we hope you enjoyed it. A huge thank you to everyone who tuned in from around the globe to witness this small piece of history and to welcome this exciting new era for the franchise. Below, you will find all the information you need to know about the new announcements, including an FAQ at the bottom to help answer any pressing questions. TOTAL WAR: MEDIEVAL III {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39760201/a0b96be6c9cf6ed8ab94aa9d5ceaa319d20591df.png We’ve been waiting a long time to say this: Total War is going back to the medieval era. We’re in the opening stages of Total War: MEDIEVAL III’s development – pre-production, to be precise, meaning we’re still years from release. But this isn’t just another game for us, it’s the realisation of something we’ve dreamed about for almost 20 years. The Medieval series is one of the most cherished chapters in Total War’s history, and creating a true successor is a goal we’ve held close for a long time. Now, we finally have the chance to make it happen. This next chapter will be both a tribute to its predecessors and a bold revolution for what historical Total War can be. The team’s vision is clear: to create the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox featuring our signature blend of grand strategy and tactical real-time battles. A game that lets you shape your realms, rewrite history, and immerse yourself in the drama and intrigue of the Middle Ages like never before. Some of you might be asking why we’ve revealed it this early, and the answer is quite simple: we want you to come on this development journey with us. At certain points throughout the year, we’ll share behind-the-scenes insights and give you a closer look at how the game is taking shape, so you can see it evolve with us – and in some cases influence its direction. This isn’t just a sequel; it’s the rebirth of historical Total War. Watch the announcement trailer here: TOTAL WAR: WARHAMMER III – LORDS OF THE END TIMES {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/39760201/3b535d8d7830063a96a677cb914f25b54a7b8156.jpg The End Times are nigh, but Total War: WARHAMMER’s saga is far from over. It’s hard to believe, but the Warhammer series is about to hit its 10-year milestone, and what better way to celebrate than with something truly apocalyptic. In summer 2026, the Lords of The End Times storm into the Immortal Empires campaign, bringing with them four brand-new Legendary Lords from different races alongside a deadly host of new units, lore inspired objectives and sandbox campaigns. Leading the charge is none other than Nagash, the great necromancer himself. Long whispered about in the darkest corners of the lore, he returns with one goal: to drown the world in undeath. He’ll be joined by a motley crew of horrors including the mighty Blood Dragon Legendary Hero, Walach Harkon, alongside Tomb Heralds, Morghast Archai, the Khemric Titan and more. But that’s not all. These new Legendary Lords arrive alongside the free End Times Update, a transformative new addition to Immortal Empires inspired by pivotal chapters from the lore. Expect a revamped campaign experience; cataclysmic events, apocalyptic scenarios, and all new campaign customisation options. And to crown this update, a new Legendary Lord will rise, ready to leave their mark on the cataclysm to come. There’s more to come, and we’ll share additional details as development moves forward into the new year. Finally, we’re in the early stages of developing our End Times content. What we’ve shared represents our current vision, but it may evolve as development continues - as always with the goal of delivering the best possible experience for all of you.

For our Core Technology team, that meant creating a new evolution of our game engine - and we’re calling it Warcore. When we looked at the lineup of future Total War titles, it was clear that our existing technology needed to level-up and Warcore is the result. It’s the most advanced engine foundation in the franchise’s history, empowering our developers with powerful tools to make gameplay more immersive, dynamic, and responsive than ever before. But it’s important to highlight that this isn’t a one-time upgrade. Our talented team have designed it with a long-term vision, so whilst it will be in its infancy at the outset, the intent is for it to evolve over time and unlock groundbreaking new capabilities that ensure Total War stays at the cutting edge of strategy gaming for years to come. And for the first time in franchise history, Warcore opens the door for future Total War titles to launch on PlayStation and Xbox, bringing the scale, depth, and tactical mastery of Total War to a n...",1764867978,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1827942241_1764868453_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

779340,Join us for the Total War 25th anniversary celebrations,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31721797/be39422cd27a3116b3ce77f4d8e689be00aaaa91.png Hey Total War fans, 25 years ago, in a small one room office just down the road from where I write this message, Total War was born. The vision was rooted in a love for both history and strategy gaming, with the aim of seamlessly mixing the best parts of grand strategy and real-time tactical battles into a single experience where you truly felt like the commander of a vast empire. During those early years Total War’s identity formed. The team were focused on authentic recreations of the most pivotal moments in human history from the Age of Antiquity through to the emergence of the great naval empires. As the genre evolved and our teams changed, we expanded into new territory by leaping into the fantastical; meticulously recreating Games Workshop’s iconic Warhammer World as a truly unique strategy experience. There have been triumphs and tribulations throughout the years, and we’re honoured and humbled to be one of the few video game franchises that get the chance to celebrate such a huge milestone. Without your support this would never have been possible – so a massive thank you from all of us on this special day! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31721797/812d90ece1ee1c37fbff348098652ce711c15ce2.jpg Some of you may remember from my update last year that we had plans to celebrate this anniversary in a meaningful way. Our teams are hard at work fine tuning a program of content that not only shines a light on past games but builds the foundation for us to begin revealing what we have planned for the future of Total War. And yes, this means the reveal of new games and content. 25 years of Total War will begin with a look back at our legacy. Taking place from August until the end of November, we’ll journey through each series that has been released since 2000. Expect content like retrospective video interviews, developer livestreams, sales across our entire catalogue, as well as fantasy and historical multiplayer tournaments. We also want to make this a celebration you can get involved in, so we'll be hosting giveaway competitions, inviting you to ask questions of our developers, as well as spotlighting your favourite mods and content creators who have helped make the Total War community what it is today. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31721797/b6e5e77e23906595528f385a024b26b119fbd6cc.jpg Beyond celebrating the past, we plan on welcoming the future of Total War in a big way. Behind the scenes, we’re in the early stages of producing the Total War: 25th Anniversary Showcase, the first video presentation of its kind in our history. Taking place in early December, this show will unveil the new games that you can expect to play in the near and distant future, as well as introduce you to the development teams making them. We’ll have more details to share as we approach the end of the year, but whether you’re a fantasy or history fan, there will be plenty to enjoy! Alongside all of this will be more WARHAMMER III content. Patch 6.2 arrives next week with a focus on Magical Items, Tides of Torment's third and final faction will be revealed in July, and we'll unveil some long-awaited content at the anniversary showcase. It's incredible to think that this series is now in its ninth year, and we look forward to sharing what we have planned for the future. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31721797/bc0af97b03b074b0aca1cb9053540cac1eca4871.jpg What’s especially important to me this year is celebrating everyone who has made Total War what it is today. This includes all of you reading this message who have helped create the best community in gaming. Whether you’re playing our games for thousands of hours, watching our trailers, submitting bug feedback, or commenting on our socials, all of this has helped us build a game we all love. It also takes an army of passionate and talented staff to take our games from concept to completion. Many of them talk about growing up with Total War; how it gave them an interest in history or the deep lore of Warhammer, and how it created a desire for them to work at Creative Assembly. They’re fans making the game they love, and I want to thank each and every one of them, past and present, for their contribution to making this milestone possible. We hope you’re excited for the future. Happy anniversary to you all, — Roger Collum, Vice President of Total War {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31721797/6c60f48ca9e3596a90de8949ddad412389e63e62.jpg For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

779340,Total War fans carry the torch with fan-made Three Kingdoms patch,"Historical Total War fans received a bit of a blow earlier this year when Creative Assembly announced it would no longer be supporting Total War: Three Kingdoms. Sure, we're getting <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/new-standalone-game"">some kind of successor</a>, but overall fans <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/no-more-dlc"">were not happy</a>. With support pretty much shut down for the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-great-strategy-games-you-really-should-play-or-else"">strategy game</a>, a group of modders have taken it upon themselves to try to inject some TLC into Three Kingdoms by making an unofficial fan patch and releasing it as a mod. ""This mod made by all the community fixed 66 bugs that CA will never fix,"" the description reads, with the Steam Workshop entry listing six names as authors. Fixes vary from characters that should be dead still able to spawn in campaigns, especially in later start dates, to errors in terrain effects that were introduced in the 1.7 patch. There are also plenty of fixes to specific leaders and factions, and this mod also incorporates contents from <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424776930&searchtext="">another mod</a> (with permission) that makes use of unused assets created by Creative Assembly for the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-total-war-games"">Total War game</a>. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/1-7-1-bug-fix-mod"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/armies-single-unit"">Total War fans discuss whether they want single unit armies again or not</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-historical-next"">Total War fans are discussing what historical title they want next</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/mods"">The best Total War: Three Kingdoms mods</a> ",1636993369,
779340,Total War fans discuss whether they want single unit armies again or not,"Total War fans are discussing one of the more pivotal changes to <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-total-war-games"">Total War games</a> of the past decade. A design shift that appeared in Total War: Rome II moved the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-great-strategy-games-you-really-should-play-or-else"">strategy game</a> away from single unit armies, to the army-centric approach where every unit had to be in a stack. In theory, this would lead to less stacks roaming the map. A poll on the Total War subreddit with over 6,000 votes currently swings in favour of bringing back independant unit movement by 60% to 40% keeping things as is, with a small minority voting 'other' as a third option. Not a decisive result as, say, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/pfv1db/where_are_you_getting_tw_wiii_steam_or_epic/"">which platform redditors are going to buy Warhammer III on</a>, which is notable in and of itself. Reading through the comments you'll also see plenty of love for Total War: Three Kingdoms, which attempts to offer the best of both worlds. Important characters can roam around the map with their own personal retinue of up to six units, and a character's class governs what units they can recruit.

779340,Total War fans are discussing what historical title they want next,"Total War: Warhammer III may be coming, but if you're not a fan of Games Workshop's iconic fantasy setting then historical Total War fans are currently a bit stumped. You have A Total War Saga: Troy, of course, but it's clear that as the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-saga-troy/steam-release-date-mythos-expansion"">Steam release</a> approaches Troy is embracing the mythological aspects of the setting. Total War: Three Kingdoms was the last 'major' historical <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-total-war-games"">Total War game</a>, but support for that <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/no-more-dlc"">officially ceased earlier this year</a>. We're getting <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/new-standalone-game"">a new Romance of the Three Kingdoms-era game</a>, but there's no clue as to what that could be. In the absence of anything concrete, series fans on the Total War subreddit are discussing what historical game they'd like to see next. Reddit user HFRreddit has posted an image that breaks down four possible options, along with the notable people and events that happened during the respective eras: Total War: Medieval III (1066 - 1453), Total War: Reformation (1494 - 1700), Total War: Empire II (1700 - 1815), Total War: Victoria (1815 - 1900). This is of course assuming that Rome III isn't on the table, and not taking into account other time periods Creative Assembly might want to explore. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-historical-next"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/armies-single-unit"">Total War fans discuss whether they want single unit armies again or not</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/mods"">The best Total War: Three Kingdoms mods</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/dlc-guide"">The complete Total War: Three Kingdoms DLC guide</a> ",1629735118,
779340,Total War: Three Kingdoms doesn't need a new game to finish what it started,"Last week Creative Assembly posted a video entitled 'The future of Total War: Three Kingdoms'. This short three-minute clip <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/new-standalone-game"">bade farewell to the game</a>, showcasing footage from across the game's lifecycle to sweeping dramatic music, and rounding up some fun player stats. The video also explained that Three Kingdoms is now ""finished"", the team is looking to the future, and that work has begun on a new <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-great-strategy-games-you-really-should-play-or-else"">strategy game</a> also based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. There's only one problem with all of this: Three Kingdoms <em>isn't</em> finished. I don't mean that as a disparagement of the game's quality, but there are at least two things the game hasn't done yet. First, we know Creative Assembly planned a second expansion pack for Three Kingdoms after <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-review"">The Furious Wild</a> that was meant to build out the north of the map - it was mentioned in <a href=""https://www.totalwar.com/blog/dev-blog-july-2020/"">a dev blog in July 2020</a>. Suddenly declaring that the team has ""completed content for Total War: Three Kingdoms"" suggests that something changed quite dramatically in the time since. At least <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/patch-1-7-1-beta-mount-song"">Mount Song and the Hulao Pass were put in the right place</a>. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/new-game"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/1-7-1-bug-fix-mod"">Total War fans carry the torch with fan-made Three Kingdoms patch</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/armies-single-unit"">Total War fans discuss whether they want single unit armies again or not</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-historical-next"">Total War fans are discussing what historical title they want next</a> ",1622812890,
779340,Total War: Three Kingdoms is getting review bombed after devs terminate support,"Yesterday <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/new-standalone-game"">Creative Assembly announced</a> that expansion and patch support for Total War: Three Kingdoms would cease, two years (and a week) since release. In its place, a new game that's also based off the iconic Romance of the Three Kingdoms book is being created, but what form this will take is not clear. While this isn't as unprecedented as it seems, it certainly took us - and the Total War community at large - a bit by surprise. We've seen a lot of confusion and disappointment over the decision, something that hasn't been helped by the slightly vague dev diary video released yesterday. Looking at Reddit alone, there are <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/nm9lll/the_news_is_confusing_and_entire_korean_total_war/"">several threads</a> you <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/nm89kl/we_have_completed_our_content_for_total_war_three/"">can read</a> where Total War fans have been voicing their concerns. On <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/779340/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS/"">Steam</a>, Total War: Three Kingdoms has received nearly 1,500 negative reviews over the past 24 hours alone. One main point of contention is the expectation that a future <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/dlc-guide"">Three Kingdoms DLC</a> would have expanded the northern areas of the map to include the 'northern tribes', in a similar way to how the Nanman were introduced into the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-great-strategy-games-you-really-should-play-or-else"">strategy game</a> via the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-review"">Furious Wild expansion</a>. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/no-more-dlc"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/mods"">The best Total War: Three Kingdoms mods</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/dlc-guide"">The complete Total War: Three Kingdoms DLC guide</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/new-game"">TW: Three Kingdoms doesn't need a new game to finish what it started</a> ",1622225821,

The game's devs have announced today that, while their work on content for Three Kingdoms DLC is now wrapped up, they're now pivoting onto a whole other project based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel.

Exactly what this new project will be is a bit of a mystery for now, with Zhang saying that the studio will share more when it's able to. However, what they do tease for now is that they're ""increasing focus on the novel's rich cast of characters and their individual and unique narratives, taking the core of what made Total War: Three Kingdoms so special and pushing it further.""

This may not seem like a big deal for some, but Three Kingdoms has been praised for its rendition of this iconic period in Chinese history and the infamous Romance of the Three Kingdoms text.

779340,Total War: Three Kingdoms - Fates Divided review,"When it was announced that Three Kingdoms' next expansion would focus on the war between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao and the Battle of Guandu, I had one question: are they going to recreate <em>that</em> scene from the TV show? You know, the one where Cao Cao laughs in Yuan Shao's face and then runs off waving his arms and snickering, like the pantomime villain he is? I figured the answer would be no (fair enough: I'm pretty sure that never actually happened in The Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel), but even without it this new expansion has plenty of rich and enjoyable tools to play with. Fates Divided is in many ways the opposite of The Furious Wild: whereas that expansion gave us the vibrant, warlike factions of the Nanman, Fates Divided and its accompanying update enrich the game's existing factions with more subtle, underhanded means of approaching problems. Many of those factions are already pretty Machiavellian, and none more so than Cao Cao. His new 'schemes' mechanic enables him to spend his credibility to basically trick the game, or as a resource to swing diplomacy in his favour. Yuan Shao's rework, on the other hand, is military minded, making captain retinues more useful by letting you upgrade them with lineage points. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/fates-divided-review"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/pacifist-campaign-fates-divided"">Total War and Peace - a pacifist run of Three Kingdoms: Fates Divided</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/fates-divided-release-date"">Total War: Three Kingdoms' next DLC is Fates Divided, out next month</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/dlc-guide"">Total War: Three Kingdoms DLC guide</a> ",1615388904,

779340,Total War and Peace - a pacifist run of Three Kingdoms: Fates Divided,"Total War games are not supposed to be played peacefully. It's right there in the name. Though many other large-scale <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-great-strategy-games-you-really-should-play-or-else"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">strategy games</a> offer non-violent victory conditions or playstyles, this series has always been about crushing opponents in the theatre of war. But Three Kingdoms is a slightly different creature. Ever since the game launched a couple of years ago, players have been trying - and sometimes even succeeding - to play pacifist campaigns. They're possible for the first time in the series thanks to an overhauled and much-deepened diplomacy system, and Liu Bei's Unity mechanic is handy for forging peaceful confederations, providing a further boon. Nevertheless, pacifist campaigns remain very difficult. But hope is here for all proponents of peace. Three Kingdoms' next expansion Fates Divided, and the hefty update that rolls in with it, give aspiring emperors a suite of new tools to solve problems without poking them with a spear.

779340,The 35 best ultrawide games on PC,"Ultrawide gaming monitors are the kind of hardware that might seem too excessive, maybe even a bit too <em>gamer</em> to bother with for playing games on PC, especially when their demanding resolutions often require powerful graphics cards to make the most of them. Once you try one, though, there’s no going back. I’ve been a big fan of ultrawide gaming monitors for years now, mostly because supported PC games just look fantastic on them. And that’s why I’ve put together this list of the best ultrawide games on PC – to show you exactly what they look like in the flesh, complete with GIFs and photos of them running on an ultrawide monitor so you can see them in motion with your own peepers. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/18/the-35-best-ultrawide-pc-games/#more-913873"" class=""more-link""> (more…) </a> ",1605722435,

779340,Total War: Three Kingdoms DLC Guide,"Total War: Three Kingdoms is an unusual game in terms of DLC - by choosing such a specific historical period in which to base a game, the options for expansion are immediately limited. Sure, you can try and re-skin an entire grand campaign and jump hundreds of years, but we've seen the middling results of that in the past such as with Empire Divided for Total War: Rome II or with Age of Charlemagne for Total War: Attila. The far better DLC model is keeping the campaign, but adding new characters, units and faction mechanics, the same way as Total War: Warhammer II. For the most part Three Kingdoms seems to be adopting this method, but with the timeline and separate period start positions added in Mandate of Heaven, we are now seeing something far stranger.

779340,Total War: Three Kingdoms - The Furious Wild review,"What little history there is behind Nanman chieftain Meng Huo suggests he had a rough go of it. He appears in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, in which he's notable for being captured and released by Zhuge Liang seven times during the Nanman's rebellion against the Han before finally admitting defeat. Total War: Three Kingdoms' new The Furious Wild expansion tells this story, and while it expands Three Kingdoms' already impressive map, it begins as a much more constrained experience. The Furious Wild starts you off in the southwestern jungles of Three Kingdoms' feudal China, taking the role of one of four tribal leaders. The Nanman people are affiliated only by shared culture, and the tribes live in a state of uneasy peace as the events of Three Kingdoms are getting underway. They can either unite and survive, or be crushed by the sweep of the Han empire as it consolidates its power and inevitably pushes at old borders. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-review"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/free-update-160"">Total War: Three Kingdoms is getting a free update with a full campaign map rework</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-dlc-interview-preview"">Total War: Three Kingdoms - Furious Wild is ""totally different""</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-expansion"">Total War: Three Kingdoms' next expansion adds ""fearsome"" Nanman factions, animal units, more</a> ",1598972435,

The developer has also added strategic chokepoints, which accommodate the new kind of tactical battle, the gate pass battle. Gate pass battles take place, as you might expect, at gate passes, which are a new type of settlement placed in strategic chokepoints. The maps are essentially fortified towns with two avenues of approach arranged opposite to each other.

779340,"Total War: Three Kingdoms - Furious Wild is ""totally different""","Yesterday, the biggest piece of DLC yet for <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-expansion"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Total War: Three Kingdoms was announced</a>. The Furious Wild will be the game's first fully fledged 'expansion pack' - as opposed to the chapter packs released to date - and will add four new factions from a wholly new culture, the Nanman, when it releases on September 3. In stark contrast to the regimented Han and their successors, the Nanman are a group of jungle-dwelling tribes. Players craving something of Total War: Warhammer's unit diversity will be thrilled to hear that they'll add over 25 new units, utilise entirely different weaponry and tactics, pursue all-new campaign goals, and that each of the four new leaders will play differently. The paid expansion will also land alongside a free update that will expand the campaign map to include the Nanman homelands in China's southwestern jungle, as well as adding new Lord (<a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299590/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS__Shi_Xie/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Shi Xie</a>), new units, and Gate Pass battle maps. To dig into all this goodness for more detail on how the Nanman play, their basis in history, and how developer Creative Assembly is continuing to satiate the ravenous appetite of its broadest, most global audience yet, we spoke exclusively with senior designer Simon Mann. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-dlc-interview-preview"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-expansion"">Total War: Three Kingdoms' next expansion adds ""fearsome"" Nanman factions, animal units, more</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dune-game-funcom-frank-herbert"">Frank Herbert's Dune is still the template for the entire RTS genre</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/a-world-betrayed-review"">Total War: Three Kingdoms - A World Betrayed DLC review</a> ",1597830017,

Titled 'The Furious Wild', the incoming DLC pack ushers in a hearty batch of new content that includes four new factions, a map extension, and even some free goodies and updates for all Three Kingdoms players to enjoy. As announced in a press release - and shown in a new trailer unveiling the expansion pack (included below) - Total War: Three Kingdoms - The Furious Wild adds four ""formidable tribal warlords"" of the Nanman culture, who call the ""deadly jungles of the south"" home. These are Meng Huo, King Mulu, Lady Zhurong, and King Shamoke, and they each boast some pretty intimidating tactics of their own. For example, new mechanics include flaming mace, blowpipe units, and among the expansion's 25 new units are even some ""revered"" elephants and tigers. Gulp. In addition, the expansion adds an expanded map for third century China, focusing on the ""lush but deadly jungles"" of the south, as well as new faction mechanics, a tech tree, and ""unique missions and narrative events bespoke for the Nanman culture"". <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-expansion"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/furious-wild-dlc-interview-preview"">Total War: Three Kingdoms - Furious Wild is ""totally different""</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dune-game-funcom-frank-herbert"">Frank Herbert's Dune is still the template for the entire RTS genre</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-three-kingdoms/a-world-betrayed-review"">Total War: Three Kingdoms - A World Betrayed DLC review</a> ",1597784302,

We've seen modders doing more than ever, filling in the gaps and creating content that CA may never get around to adding themselves across both fantasy and historical. Total War: Three Kingdoms is the most popular and innovative historical Total War we've seen in years. Also being based in such a popular historical period, and being of so much interest to the Chinese gaming community, there have been a tonne of mods. These not only add elements to make character even more distinctive, but also offer a touch of individuality to players, which feels very at home in a historical period, which at its heart, is about heroes. What are the best Total War: Three Kingdoms Mods? * Make them Unique (Overhaul); * Wu Kingdaissance (Overhaul); * ...
