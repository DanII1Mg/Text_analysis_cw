Since the 1.0 release, we want to continue delivering a stable experience on the default version of the game Using experimental allows us to polish everything up some more before releasing it to everyone and potentially including some side effects which might affect the current experience Also, as usual this update is quite big in terms of changes as we’ve been working alongside with Fishlabs ( https://fishlabs.de ) for a few years now They have designed and implemented the controller support in preparation for the Console release (Yes, Satisfactory is coming to consoles if you didn’t know already) with our blessing and collaboration This update includes many years worth of work so as usual, if you find anything unexpected or something that was working before suddenly does not work anymore, please let us know over at our QA Site https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/ Your posts are incredibly helpful and your feedback is always appreciated, But for now let’s dive into the new content Controls > General > Select Controls > Controller > Apply Photo Mode There’s been a major overhaul to the existing Photo Mode adding brand new UI and Settings Including a multitude of new filters, effects, poses, frames, colour adjustments, camera lens controls to tweak to your liking, there’s a huge number of possibilities to get the ideal shot of you and your factories or you and your friends in multiplayer There’s also a dolly mode so you can create small transitions and videos or anything your creativity allows, as well as multiple grid and crop settings for aspect ratios You can also decouple the camera to move it around within a range of the pioneer and toggle visibility options for the Pioneer or even have the option to have the Pioneer’s helmet follow the camera around Crash Site Dismantling You will also now will finally be able to clean up debris from Crash Sites from your biomes and get some extra resources for your efforts by doing so Just remember that you must open and retrieve the Hard Drive inside the Crash Site first to be able to dismantle everything Personnel Elevator To expand your traversal options for Pioneers in larger factories, you can now build and use the new Personnel Elevator Once you do the initial elevator placement, you will be able to zoop vertically to desired your elevation and add as many Elevator Floor Stops as you wish to match with your factory design You will be able to customize the names for each floor as well as the icons and colours for each button that you can press to access each floor so you can keep track of exactly where each stop leads Advanced Game Settings No Fuel setting The highly requested “No fuel” option has finally been added to Advanced Game Settings, so you if you enjoy playing with AGS, you no longer have to do extra steps when using vehicles Trains Buffer Stops We’re introducing a new mechanic for trains, when manually driving a Train and reaching the end of the railway, Trains will now derail entirely and you will have to interact with the train in order to get it back on the rail, similar to how Train Collisions work To prevent this, you now must place Buffer Stops at the end of Railway paths, Including Train Stations, that you intend to manually drive through QOL Left-handed Path and Block Signals Both Path signals and Block signals now have a “Left Side” and “Right Side” build mode that can be alternated by pressing R when having the hologram active Railways rework Railways have gotten some major improvements with their implementation, so they should be a lot nicer and better to build overall than ever Buildings Logistics Conveyor Wall Hole New Conveyor attachment that can be freely placed on any Wall (And Windows!) allowing for conveyors to pass through to allow for more customization. A big improvement compared to the existing Conveyor walls with a fixed placement for connections Conveyor Lifts - Splitter and Merger support The Splitter and Mergers capabilities have now improved, and they can now be attached to Conveyor Lifts, allowing more modularity to your vertical builds Splitters or Mergers will attach to both the Input or Output of a Conveyor Lift, as well to any point in-between, for extra flexibility in your builds Priority Merger This is a new type of Merger that allows you to prioritize which one of its active inputs should be output first There are 3 levels of priority to choose, so if two inputs share the same level of prior...",1743512564,

526870,Experimental Update v1.0.1.6,"Hi Pioneers! Hello again everyone, Here is another patch for Experimental, today we have a much bigger change that improves our Foliage, Lightweight, Recipe and Schematics systems to overcome multiple networking bottlenecks that we’ve had in the past While playing in Multiplayer and Dedicated Servers, you could end up in situations where after removing large amounts of foliage, foliage might stop replicating completely, resulting in foliage being non-interactable or not properly disappearing, the same could happen to buildables like Foundations and Walls among others after building many of them. We’ve made improvements that should result in less strain on Unreal Engine’s replication system leading to an improved multiplayer experience, they should also alleviate the “Reliable Buffer Overflow” issues on joining a session, as well as addressing additional side issues like interacting with the Advanced Game Settings menu during multiplayer kicking you out of a session With this, there should be a significant improvement in how fast foliage and buildables are loaded, compared to joining a save and seeing buildables and foliage pop in and out of existence or have them be uninteractable Since changes in Experimental might have some unexpected side effects, please BACKUP YOUR SAVES before trying it out You can find your saves in: %LocalAppData%/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/ There should be a folder with a lot of numbers, that is your Steam/Epic ID and that folder will contain your saves, you can copy this folder somewhere else If you would like to know more about this change and the previous changes added to experimental you should watch our video on them by our community manager Mikael https://youtu.be/Z3UtGdftZbc If you would like to quickly access the Experimental version, first BACKUP YOUR SAVES and then: For Steam: Then right click the Game on Steam > Properties > Betas > Beta Participation > Select Experimental For Epic: Look in your game library for “Satisfactory Experimental” from there you can install it And don’t forget to BACKUP YOUR SAVES before you start playing We’re very curious to hear about your experience with this latest patch so please let us know over at our QA Site if you encounter any new issues https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/ We appreciate all of your feedback And remember, If the Experimental release turns out to be too unstable for you, you can always switch back to the default version of the game and restore your save game and continue enjoying Satisfactory as usual See you all again soon ",1741715993,['patchnotes']
526870,Experimental Update v1.0.1.5,"Hi Pioneers! Hello again everyone, Today we are reopening Experimental again! From now on we intend to use Experimental to properly implement bigger bug fixes, programming changes or optimizations without compromising the current 1.0 experience for those who are comfortably playing in the 1.0 default version of Satisfactory This should also help with reducing the frequency of patches/downloads necessary for the majority of players since we’ll space out a bit more when we will move Experimental versions into the default version once they have been stabilized Since changes in Experimental might have some unexpected side effects, please BACKUP YOUR SAVES before trying it out You can find your saves in: %LocalAppData%/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/ There should be a folder with a lot of numbers, that is your Steam/Epic ID and that folder will contain your saves, you can copy this folder somewhere else The fixes today involve the Customizer, Lightweight Buildables as well as a Dedicated server fix and some crash fixes, if you would like to know more about the changes in detail you should watch our video on them by our community manager Mikael https://youtu.be/Z3UtGdftZbc If you would like to quickly access the Experimental version, first BACKUP YOUR SAVES and then: For Steam: Then right click the Game on Steam > Properties > Betas > Beta Participation > Select Experimental For Epic: Look in your game library for “Satisfactory Experimental” from there you can install it And don’t forget to BACKUP YOUR SAVES before you start playing If we happened to introduce any new issues with these changes, please let us know over at our QA Site https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/ We appreciate all of your feedback If the Experimental release turns out to be too unstable for you, you can always switch back to the default version of the game and restore your save game and continue enjoying Satisfactory as usual See you all again soon ",1739898632,['patchnotes']

526870,FICS*MAS Available now!,"https://i.imgur.com/7cNTEMk.png Hi Pioneers! It's once again that time of the year, and after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reaction from all of you over our 1.0 release, we wanted to give you all something special before we started to go on vacation for the holidays. So, keeping with the holiday spirit, we decided to give FICS*MAS a bit of the 1.0 treatment which means all the previously released FICS*MAS content should now be looking and playing better than ever ! What this boils down to is that there are new surprises for all of you to unlock, explore and enjoy! If you would like to see a small teaser of what FICS*MAS is, take a look at this video from our community managers: The FICS*MAS event will be available in the 1.0 and Experimental versions of the game from December 1st 2024, until January 18th 2025! As always, we want to make sure no one feels pressured to rush their FICS*MAS projects while also dealing with work or the holidays in real life. By letting the event run into mid-January, there should be plenty of time to enjoy all of FICS*MAS even if you pick it up for the first time by the end of December as everything in the Calendar can be unlocked retroactively until the last day of FICS*MAS. For this year, we’ve also done gameplay updates to the Calendar and MAM FICS*MAS Research Tree to make it easier to progress and prevent soft-locking by losing items, as well as some rebalancing to FICS*MAS-related build costs and item stacks to make setting up the production line more fun. https://i.imgur.com/3cVjwIa.png As for the Calendar, like always, you'll be able to unlock new goodies daily that are crucial for your Pioneering needs as you progress through it. The updates we’ve done to it will be revealed when the day is right for it, quite literally. What’s December without some of that sweet, sweet waiting game? We could talk in more detail about the new stuff included in this year's FICS*MAS, but considering the nature of the event, we feel like that would be spoiling much of the fun.. So if you want to find out more, download the latest update and check the Calendar in the HUB to get started! https://i.imgur.com/26JNReL.png Also! In case you missed our previous post; with the FICS*MAS update we're also releasing bunch of fixes and optimizations, as well as answering some requests like the ability to copy paste settings on Generators and Extractors. These changes are more general and here to stay, unrelated to FICS*MAS, so if you're curious about those you can read more the changes here: 1.0 Fixes v1.0.1.0 Patch Notes But that's not all!, Today we have a few highly requested fixes as well: GAMEPLAY Reverted the snapping changes when building on the sides of Pillars to allow free placement again BUG FIXES Potential fix for a crash when replacing holograms with another (I.e.

526870,Only 2 weeks left until 1.0 Releases!,"Summer may soon be over, but for some of us, that end couldn’t come any faster. In just over 2 weeks, what has been an 8-year long development process and 5-year journey through Early Access will end, and Satisfactory 1.0 will finally launch on September 10th. While this date does not mark the definitive end for the game’s development, it is certainly a colossal milestone for our team as much as for our community, and one worth celebrating fondly. Today, we want to dive into a few more details about what exactly it is we’ll be celebrating, so without further ado: helmets on, Pioneers (as if you have a choice). PHASE 5 AND TIER 9 https://i.imgur.com/iQl9Skh.jpeg If you skipped physics back in school, now is the time to catch up. The main attraction of 1.0 will be the endgame, and we’re thrilled to finally be able to share that it comes in the form of a brand new fifth phase and ninth tier with a heavy focus on Quantum Technology! While many parts from earlier tiers will be relevant in progressing through phase 5, a bunch of new items are being added on top, almost all of them as complex to craft as their names are hard to articulate. With all these new toys available to you, your goal will be to give the Space Elevator one last run for its money and finish Project Assembly once and for all. While we won’t share the juiciest details with you just yet, phase 5 is aimed to feel like a natural progression path continuing from phase 4, in terms of gameplay and advancements in technology. We’re also intending for it to add to the narrative beats coming in 1.0 (more on that very soon…), through many of the phase’s ongoing visuals and the logic behind how some of the machines operate. And as the icing on an ever more power consuming cake, we’ve also addressed some recurring feedback regarding a few things in the game. Perhaps the Mk.3 Miner was never the issue? Finally, it is worth noting that with phase 5 introduced to the game, the no-longer-final phase 4 will have its requirements for completion relaxed. The previous requirements were placeholder and intentionally tuned to absurd numbers to deter people from completing it during Early Access, and that worked about as well as you’d expect considering the players we’re dealing with. The new requirements will be as follows: 500 Assembly Director Systems, 500 Magnetic Field Generators, 250 Thermal Propulsion Rockets and 100 Nuclear Pasta. FICSIT is expecting pristine performance, Pioneer. NARRATIVE In fact, more on that right now! The narrative of Satisfactory has been cooking in the oven for a long time. After receiving the initial wave of feedback from our first playtests, it was clear that players wanted a purpose as to why they were building all their factories and committing industrial takeover. Over the course of Early Access, however, we’ve chosen to not include a work-in-progress story in the game at all, to not show our hand early and reveal spoiler-y elements of the world before they are fully complete. Keeping the story under wraps has also allowed us to rethink how we approach it whenever it grew too big or ambitious, and to reiterate on it whenever we felt like a different style of storytelling in Satisfactory made sense. So, let’s talk about what does make sense: the goal of the implementation of Satisfactory’s narrative is for it to be non-disruptive to the core gameplay loop, while leaving the world people have already gotten familiar with unchanged. Satisfactory is first and foremost a factory building game, and this narrative must fit that vision. Thus, there will not be any campaign mode to access from the main menu, nor a marked “main scenario” route to follow on your map etc., like players may expect from many other titles. There also won’t be any cutscenes that outright stop player movement or agency. There will be an ending to the game to work towards, but it won’t halt your building momentum or stop you from further progressing your factories in your session or save file - all gameplay elements will remain undisturbed. Being this secretive about Satisfactory’s story for so many years has, naturally, also led to things changing about the narrative itself since its original conception. In fact, almost every detail we’ve teased about story specifics on various Socials has been changed. The broad strokes remain the same - Planet Massage-2(A-B) is still the same world you’ve come to know, and you’re still a Pioneer working for FICSIT. FICSIT itself has changed a lot, however, and characters such as Caterina Parks and Steve are no longer part of the game. Really, the only familiar aspect of FICSIT remaining is ADA, Vocaloid and all, because we’re not interested in finding out how fast our office will be torn to shreds (rightfully) by you all if ADA is ever removed. Finally, Mercer Spheres and Somersloops, which we’ve labeled as story-related work-in-progress items in the past, will still have some connection to the narrative but their main purpose h...",1724685112,

526870,Satisfactory 1.0 Release Date,"Satisfactory is finally leaving Early Access and launching into 1.0 on September 10th! Players can look forward to plenty new features coming in 1.0, however, today we're happy to announce one of the most long awaited features, You will finally be able to flush the toilet in the HUB!!! Premium plumbing is now a reality, the HUB’s once trivial toilet has been updated with an advanced flushing mechanism, providing an extra luxurious worker experience for pioneers. I'm sure this is all the news you need to be excited for 1.0 but there's of course much more content coming. Much of it has yet to be revealed but let's summarize some of the changes we've revealed so far coming in 1.0. WORLD UPDATES Several resource nodes have been added, altered, or removed on the world map, enabling new possibilities to tangle the most beautiful conveyor belt spaghetti to ever grace Planet MASSAGE-2(A-B)b. Even seasoned Pioneers may need to remove their helmets and scratch their heads over how to efficiently use all new resources available to them. The bulk of specifically node reductions have happened in the Northern Forest, to encourage expansion from there once players progress into the later phases of the game. On the same note, nodes have been sprinkled throughout the map, placed where it makes geographical sense and to achieve a more even spread of resources. The main materials addressed are Caterium, Sulfur and Quartz. On top of this, nodes of Iron, Copper, Limestone as well as water Geysers have received the sprinkle treatment across the map, to help the income of basic resources wherever you raise a factory. Coal has also seen changes, with a slew of it being added in close vicinity to The Abyss, while also being removed in a couple spots on the map. For full details on how resource nodes have changed, please refer to our node maps in the Satisfactory 1.0 Press Kit. https://i.imgur.com/9CWNHKG.jpg RECIPE UPDATES 1.0 also introduces changes made to recipe costs, to promote smoother transitions between phases and tiers especially later in the game, and to allow players to access tools, vehicles and other fun things for you to use while having fun working your bones off for FICSIT (just don’t tell your boss you enjoy your job!). We want to allow players to explore more varied means of exploration, optimization and better quality of life as they progress through Project Assembly. In tiers 5 and 6, progress will no longer be gated by Heavy Modular Frames and Computers respectively - you can now progress through either tiers without these items. In the case of Heavy Modular Frames, manufacturing them becomes more relaxed by reducing the number of Encased Industrial Beams needed. Computers, meanwhile, no longer require Screws to be created, reducing the number of materials needed to manufacture them to three. A key takeaway from these example changes is that you may now unlock Trains without utilizing Heavy Modular Frames or Computers whatsoever! Another example of the relaxed requirements in the endgame is how players will interact with Supercomputers in 1.0, which will no longer be used to make Programmable Splitters or Geothermal Generators. Programmable Splitters will instead use AI Limiters, and Geothermal Generators will use Highspeed Connectors. RESEARCH UPDATES Like the relaxed Recipes, changes are being made in several MAM Research trees to not have players face a huge spike in complexity and effort when moving between adjacent Tiers. Relaxing the harsh wall introduced by Supercomputers even further, they are no longer part of the Caterium MAM Tree. For explorations sake, Gas Masks are now unlocked through the Mycelia MAM Tree instead of in Tier 5, and the Jetpack will be available upon entering Tier 5 rather than needing Oil Processing completed first GENERATOR UPDATES Power issues could be strong causes for friction up till now, especially early-game, which we also mean to address in 1.0. Firstly, Biomass Burners now have an input for Conveyor Belts, letting you automate everything yielded by your relentless planetary deforestation. The hope with this change is that people can spend more time designing and building early game factories without being stopped regularly by the need to refill Burners manually. Furthermore, in the late-game, Fuel Generators are seeing an increase in how much power they can produce, from 150MWh to 250MWh, or a roughly 67% increase. With this change, Fuel Generators will also consume proportionally more materials, but the additional power they provide should make them able to compete easier with Nuclear power now, which otherwise tends to overshadow the need for Fuel Generators. FURTHER GAME OPTIMIZATION Efforts to ensure a stable and consistent gaming experience with Satisfactory never cease. 1.0 has had a lot of time to simmer in UE5, and steps have been taken to further reduce stuttering, memory requirements, overly chunky computations and texture memory requirements.

526870,Update 8 is now out on Early Access!,"Hi Pioneers! Today Update 8 is now available on the Early Access version of Satisfactory for everyone to try out and have fun with it! This update showcases the combined efforts of the studio over more than a year worth of work with both Unreal Engine 5 and Update 8 as a whole, so there are a LOT of changes that have happened since Update 7 released on Early Access. We’ve spent the last few months trying our best to stabilize as much as we can so you all can have a good experience when Update 8 releases on Early Access, with that being said, It never hurts to BACK UP YOUR SAVES :) If you are experiencing issues, want to give us some feedback, or just post any cool ideas you might have, please let us know over at our QA/Questions Site: https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/ We always enjoy reading all your comments after a big update like this Our community manager Snutt has prepared a new video for you all which goes over what’s new in Update 8 so be sure to check it out If you have been following along through Experimental, everything in this patch notes will be already known to you, as this build has little or no changes from the latest Experimental from last week, but you can still give them a look as there might be a new thing or two you didn’t know about However, If you haven’t been keeping up with the patch releases at all, there are a LOT of new things to go through, so grab a snack/drink and let’s get started Upgrading to Unreal Engine 5 With this come many reworks and updates of systems that should improve aspects of the game, We’ve put a lot of effort into stabilising the game and performance before the Early Access release, but there might very well be things that we’ve missed. So again please back up your saves and let us know about any differences that you encounter while playing Update 8. Jace talked about the upgrade in depth in one of our earliest Update 8 videos check it out for more info! : https://youtu.be/dY__x2dq7Sk World partitioning With world partitioning in UE5 the level streaming should be much more flexible compared to the tile-based system we used before, reducing hitches that you will have encountered where these tiles used to intersect. Vehicle physics & sound overhaul With UE5 comes an all-new physics simulation called Chaos, we’ve reworked our vehicles to use this instead of our previous implementation. The manual driving of vehicles has been redone and we made improvements in feel and usage of the different vehicles. With this we also reworked all vehicle sounds, eliminating many issues and overall improving quality and consistency. Enhanced Input System A new system we switched to with Unreal Engine 5 is the Enhanced Input system. With this we implemented contextual key bindings in the options, allowing for much more granularity and control over your control scheme across different contexts like the build mode, driving vehicles, using equipment, etc. Upscaling (DLSS, XeSS, FSR) Added several upscalers for any hardware that supports them. Anti-aliasing (TSR & FXAA) We added a lightweight anti-aliasing method known as FXAA (Fast approximate anti-aliasing) which allows for better performance on lower end machines or for people that don’t like the effect that the previous default anti-aliasing technique had. We also support TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) which is Epic’s implementation of upscaling technology combined with anti-aliasing. For user experience we added several presets: Performance, Balanced, Quality & Insanity. Nanite With Unreal Engine 5 comes Nanite, a new way of rendering complex meshes allowing for high visual quality. Due to complications we only decided to convert a part of our content to Nanite. Rocks, Cliffs and Conveyor items will be using Nanite for the time being. Lumen Lumen is a Global Illumination system that improves lighting and reflections. This new rendering feature will make the world and factory more grounded which can result in more intense & realistic scenes. We decided to have Lumen disabled by default even on the ultra-preset due to its high demand on the hardware. There are several scalability options to make Lumen perform well on most hardware. When using Lumen, we recommend running with an up-scaler enabled on the “Performance” preset and Lumen on Medium or High due to the minimum quality difference. Blueprint improvements There were a number of improvements you’ve requested and that we still wanted to make, which should significantly improve using them Jace talks a about the new features coming to Blueprints in this video: https://youtu.be/ZDN_b6TX5gg Dismantling We’ve added a Blueprint dismantle mode that you can toggle with ‘R’ by default while in the regular dismantle mode. With this you can dismantle an entire Blueprint at once! Building Blueprints now have a directional indicator in their hologram making it easier to place them in the correct rotation. We also implemented Quick Switch for Blueprints, allowing you to quickly toggle...",1699978303,

526870,Update 8 Fixes v0.8.2.1,"Hi Pioneers! Hello everyone, here’s a few hotfixes from some of the bigger issues we’ve seen you encounter from yesterday that might be preventing some people from playing the game or that will hopefully improve the experience for others. There’s two things to explain for this patch: New Pioneer being assigned when loading your save If you’ve linked your accounts before, yesterday’s patch would give you a new character, so you would see your previous character offline hanging out where you previously were. The temporary solution was to find your old character and hit it with a weapon and then retrieve your items If you did this, Today’s patch will result in the same situation, you will go back to your original character, so it will once again seem like you got a “new character” even though it is now back to the original What this means is that if you didn’t play yesterday at all, the expected behaviour should be that you don’t get a new character at all, you shouldn’t be affected. Offline mode will now be automatically started when online authentication is not available or hasn’t finished This will be done without a popup for now as it is WIP, so if you get in-game and notice that you’re not able to invite or join multiplayer games try relaunching the game and wait a bit longer for the authentication to finish, You can see the status of this on the bottom left of the screen.
