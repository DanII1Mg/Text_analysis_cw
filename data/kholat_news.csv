343710,The best Steam games that have literally zero players,"It's the year 2123. Half-Life 3 still isn't out yet. In a dark, dusty server farm, two explorers finally break through the wall to the inner chamber. Flashlights dance across strange hieroglyphics, ancient messages etched into the whiteboard - ""Dead Space Remake is fire,"" ""I totally ship Astarion and Gale,"" ""lol how mid is Starfield?"" Buried amid these decrepit slabs of black plastic and SSD trays, forgotten, forsaken videogames of a bygone empire. Once, they were adored by millions of people. Now, they are abandoned, left to rot in the Steam libraries of gamers past. It might be hard to imagine, a world where Baldur's Gate 3 and Counter-Strike 2 have become but relics. Time, however, is a brutal monarch. Even the best games are eventually left with zero players. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-games-with-zero-players"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/twitch-prime-free-games-july-2020"">Twitch Prime's next five free games are available now</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dear-esther/the-chinese-room-digital-refunds"">Dear Esther devs The Chinese Room aren't happy about the current digital refund system</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dear-esther/dear-esther-landmark-edition-release-time"">Dear Esther: Landmark Edition is out tomorrow on PC, and it's free for owners of the original</a> ",1703794697,

While we were digging the numbers one peculiar fact draw our attention – there was a country where Kholat sold one single unit on Steam – Nepal. We couldn’t help ourselves but wonder who is that person. Whoever is that guy or gal, that one person in 29 million people country, we would like to express our gratitude for the support and grant him or her a lifetime voucher for all past and future games developed and published by IMGN.PRO on Steam. If that’s you and you’re reading it now - please reach out to us on cooperation@imgn.pro We would actually love to visit Nepal and meet you in person soon.
