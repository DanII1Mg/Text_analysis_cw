10,Come slide with me through loopy shooter maps in this homage to Counter-Strike's beloved glitch surfing,"Counter-Strike surfing is a modded game mode for Valve's bomb defusal <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games"">FPS</a> in which players skate through obstacle courses by means of a physics glitch. It has a proud history dating back to 2004, when modder Charles ""Mariowned"" Joyce discovered that it was far more enjoyable to slide off roofs than shoot people in his custom map Killbox. So he made a new map dedicated to sliding, The Gap. Thus the greasy chute that led to Alice0 (RPS in peace) hailing CS surfing as <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-surfing-is-the-esport-we-deserve"">""the esport we deserve""</a> in 2020. People have crafted their own versions of the mode in games like Roblox, and Proper Game Developers such as Blizzard have seemingly taken inspiration - <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch"">Overwatch</a>'s Lucio is surely a love letter to the mode. Now here comes SurfsUp, a free-to-play surfing game in the Godot Engine. Released this month, it's been favourably compared to surf maps in Valve's <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two"">Counter-Strike 2</a>, and is worth a pop even if you have no prior experience of counters or striking.

Originally a humble Half-Life mod, <strong>Counter-Strike</strong> was quickly spotted and bought by Valve, which also hired its two developers. 25 years later, Counter-Strike 2 averages 1.6 million peak concurrent players per day - estimates vary, but most sources assert that the shooter earns Valve around a billion dollars a year. Not bad for something that was first built in a college dorm room. Le, however, doesn't work at Valve anymore.

10,The unlikely origin of Counter-Strike surfing,"In my younger and more vulnerable years, I spent a lot of time getting shot in the head in Counter-Strike: Source. While there were many factors working against me - my age, my characteristic lack of dexterity, my (for the time) toaster-level PC, and my bargain-bin 200 DPI Dell laser mouse - I never let these disadvantages stop me from padding some lucky player's K/D ratio with my ill-fated MAC-10 rushes. When I would search through the list of servers for players of a similar skill level, I would come across a panoply of fan-made mods and maps intended to offer a respite from the endless dual grind of de_dust and cs_office, and I would occasionally take the plunge and sully my dad's hard-drive with these bizarre creations. Of these offerings, the most consistently-populated servers were always devoted to the act of ""surfing,"" a fact that boggled my pre-teen mind. When I would connect, I would see long, sloped ramps to nowhere, curling and twisting through empty space towards an unknown destination. While my opponents seemed to slide across the slope with ease, I would hurtle into the abyss every single time. No matter how loudly I pleaded with my fellow surfers to explain the trick, they would hurl obscenities at me and tell me to use F10 to deploy parachute - a button which would, in fact, abort the game. (To be fair, it was pretty funny the first time.) Later in life, I eventually figured out that holding a movement key against the slope allowed you to stick to the path, and I embraced surfing and other such ""trickjumping"" as a fun palate-cleanser at the end of a long night of gaming. Charlie ""Mariowned"" Joyce is the apparent inventor of the first surf map for Counter-Strike 1.6. Joyce confided this in <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a4r4yz/whats_your_greatest_accomplishment_that_you_cant/"" target=""_blank"">AskReddit thread</a> where people revealed their ""greatest accomplishment"" that they can't bring up in normal conversation, and he was immediately mobbed by fans of his work, and surfing in general. ""It was pretty overwhelming,"" he tells me. ""I thought I'd just get a couple of people saying, 'hey, I remember surfing, that's cool.' Or maybe, best-case scenario, reconnecting with an old buddy.

10,"Valve has 1,700 CPUs working non-stop to bust CS:GO cheaters","All popular multiplayer games fight never-ending battles against cheaters. But as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive rose in 2014 to become the most-played FPS in the world, a few things made it particularly susceptible to hacking.&#xA0; As the 10th game released on Source (and the third mainline CS), there were already piles of knowledge on how to tamper with Valve&apos;s engine. Hacks built for ancient stuff like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch could, with a few minutes&apos; tweaking, perhaps function in CS:GO (although Valve says they&apos;d be trivial to detect). Design-wise, the traits that make CS:GO a skillful game of angles and accuracy also make cheats more effective. Weapons are highly lethal, so putting those guns in the hands of aimbots makes them even more devastating. And CS:GO&apos;s focus on information and stealth means that knowing the location of your opponent is invaluable&#x2014;fertile ground for wallhacks. CS:GO&apos;s fight against hackers is &quot;important, valuable work&quot; according to Valve, but if you&apos;ve played the FPS, you may have noticed a couple years ago that things were beginning to get dramatically better. Not only did Reddit complaints and frustrated replay clips of cheaters seem to circulate less frequently, but the perception of cheating&#x2014;as hazardous as anything to a competitive game&apos;s health&#x2014;seemed to dissipate. We published stories of high-profile bans, along with news of <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/more-than-11000-csgo-cheaters-ate-the-banhammer-today/""> thousands of cheaters </a> getting banned in single waves. How was Valve purging most of these jerks? ""Cheaters didn't get the memo we were doing it, and players were super happy and we were just busting cheaters left and right. It felt so good."" John McDonald, Valve In one of the only in-depth moments of transparency on this topic, Valve programmer John McDonald spoke at the Game Developers Conference last week in San Francisco about how he and Valve used deep learning techniques to address CS:GO&apos;s cheating problem. This approach has been so effective that Valve is now using deep learning on &quot;a bunch of problems,&quot; from anti-fraud to aspects of Dota 2, and Valve is actively looking for other studios to work with on implementing their deep learning anti-cheat solution in other games on Steam. Solving CS:GO&apos;s cheating problem While between projects sometime in 2016, McDonald noticed that &quot;The only thing the community was talking about was cheating,&quot; based on online discussion and a private email address that received mail from CS:GO pros. &quot;It was this, just, deafening conversation,&quot; he says. The uptick in VAC bans around this period, McDonald says, supported what Valve was hearing. To combat the issue, Valve and McDonald looked to deep learning, a solution that had the potential to operate and adapt over time to new cheating techniques&#x2014;attractive traits to Valve, which has historically elected to automate aspects of Steam rather than hire hundreds of new employees to tackle issues like curation. What Valve created is known as VACnet, a project that represents about a year of work.&#xA0; VACnet works alongside <a href=""http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/""> Overwatch </a>, CS:GO&apos;s player-operated replay tool for evaluating players who have been reported for bad behavior. VACnet isn&apos;t a new form of VAC, the client and server-side tech that Valve&apos;s used for years to identify, say, when someone&apos;s running a malicious program alongside a game. VACnet is a new, <em>additional</em> system that uses deep learning to analyze players&apos; in-game behavior, learn what cheats look like, and then spot and ban hackers based on a dynamic criteria. ""Our customers are seeing fewer cheaters today than they have been, and the conversation around cheating has died down tremendously."" John McDonald, Valve McDonald says that &quot;subtle&quot; cheats remain difficult to solve, but in building VACnet, Valve decided to target aimbots first because they present themselves at specific, easily-definable points during rounds of CS:GO: when you&apos;re shooting. This allowed Valve to build a system that captured the changes in pitch (Y-axis) and yaw (X-axis)&#x2014;degree measurements in a player&apos;s perspective&#x2014;a half a second before a shot, and a quarter second after. This data, along with other pieces of information like what weapon the player is using, their distance, the result of the shot (hit, miss, headshot?) are the individual &apos;data particles&apos; that together form what Valve calls &quot;atoms,&quot; essentially a data package that describes each shot.&#xA0; VACnet can&apos;t necessarily spot a cheater based on one atom, though. &quot;We need a sequence of them, what we actually want is 140 of them, or at least that&apos;s what the model uses right now &#x2026; We just take the 140 out of an eight round window and we stuff those into the model, and we&apos;re like, &apos;Hey, if you were to present this sequence of 140 shots to a juror, what is the likelihood you would get a convict...",1522028328,

10,American team makes it to the final of a CS:GO Major for the second time ever,"<a href=""https://twitter.com/itsmeERROR/status/957446332553334785""> Photo by Jo o Ferreira, click for source. </a> For as long as CS:GO has existed as an esport, North American teams have played the role of the underdogs, perpetually overshadowed by European&#x2014;and recently, Brazilian&#x2014;squads who always end up taking home the hardware at the big tournaments. Since the advent of the Valve-supported Major tournaments in 2013, no North American team has ever won one; today, at the penultimate day of ELEAGUE Boston Major 2018, the Americans of Cloud9 have brought themselves tantalizingly close to ending that drought. After a rocky start in the group stages, Cloud9 fought their way back into contention with a convincing 2-0 win over the French squad of G2 Esports. The vagaries of the tournament bracket meant that this victory set them on a collision course with CS:GO&#x2019;s current team to beat, the top-ranked Brazilians of SK Gaming. Riding a wave of momentum, and with the hometown crowd cheering their countrymen on, Cloud9 nonetheless entered their semi-final match as the heavy underdog. As soon as the first map got underway, it was clear that it was time to throw rational predictions out the window. A series of incredibly well-executed rounds and some huge individual plays led Cloud9 to a crushing 16-3 victory to start things off, shocking the analyst desk and driving the crown into a frenzy. Despite the second map not going quite as well, resulting in a 16-8 victory for SK Gaming, Cloud9&#x2019;s momentum appeared unbreakable, and they rallied to win 16-9 on the third map to clinch their berth in the tournament&#x2019;s grand finals. This outcome marks only the second time a North American team has managed to make it into the finals of a Major, after Team Liquid reached (and subsequently lost) the finals of ESL One Cologne back in 2016. If they pull off a win tomorrow against the formidable opposition of FaZe Clan, they will make CS:GO history, and perhaps begin to turn the reputation of American Counter-Strike around. They&#x2019;ll also have faced one of the toughest roads to victory of any Major-winning team in recent memory, due to their lacklustre performance in the group stages putting them in a very tough bracket position. Making their way through G2 Esports, SK Gaming and FaZe Clan, <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2018/january/23""> the fourth, first, and second best </a> CS:GO teams in the world respectively, is a feat that will finally put to bed any question about Cloud9&#x2019;s legitimacy as a top-tier team on the world stage.

10,"CS:GO's new Dust 2 map, reviewed","<a href=""https://doctorred2000.deviantart.com/art/SFM-CS-GO-Wallpapers-657157142"" target=""_blank""> Image by DoctorRed2000 on DeviantArt </a> For the last few days, Valve has been teasing the release of a revamped version of venerated Counter-Strike map Dust 2, and yesterday <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/feast-your-eyes-on-and-test-out-the-revamped-counter-strike-map-dust2/""> they spilled the full beans </a> on the new facelift. Valve&apos;s been refreshing old Counter-Strike maps for a while now, in an attempt to keep CS:GO looking as modern as possible, but messing with Dust 2 is a bit more of a risky proposition than modifying less-played maps like Train. The more beloved a map is, the larger the potential backlash will be. Dust 2 has been a staple of competitive play for over 15 years, and was far and away the most played map in the game until its removal from the active map pool back in February.&#xA0; It&apos;s not surprising, then, that Valve&apos;s rework is so conservative. While all the assets have been replaced with higher-res, higher-poly ones, achieving the goal of bringing the map in line with modern graphical expectations, changes to the way the map plays are modest.&#xA0; The biggest change is to the visual clarity, which has been improved across the map. Most of the dark or busy looking areas that allowed players to blend in with their surroundings have been illuminated: the tunnels leading to B are much brighter thanks to a new open ceiling, and a lot of the crates throughout the map have been draped in white cloth to better contrast with player models. Bombsite A benefits from the deletion of the busy-looking doors at the back of A long, and some cleanup of the wall decoration along catwalk. These are bound to be uncontroversial changes, and are in line with what Valve has been doing with the other map facelifts. There&#x2019;s also been some common sense cleanup work that probably should&#x2019;ve happened years ago. Stuff like widening the window from CT spawn into B site, and simplifying the scaffolding near CT-side mid doors, feels like pretty basic quality-of-life improvements that will prevent newer players from getting stuck on weird geometry or having their shots glance off of random pipes. What impact will these changes have? In the coming weeks we&#x2019;ll get a better idea of the full ramifications of this update. A couple things to keep an eye on will be whether the new single car on A long (which replaces a pair of cars that were at odd angles in the map&#x2019;s previous version) will actually be useful as cover now, and whether the increase in room to maneuver behind B site&#x2019;s car will increase its viability as a hold point for CTs. It s a healthy overhaul that makes some modest but interesting changes without reinventing the wheel. There are also some subtle changes that may not even be intentional, and may or may not have a substantial impact on gameplay. Foremost among these is a problem we&#x2019;ve seen already on some of the other modernized maps, but doesn&#x2019;t seem to have caused enough of a ruckus to attract Valve&#x2019;s notice: almost every previously-flat surface is now slightly bumpy (presumably for visual fidelity reasons), which affects the way grenades bounce off of floors and walls. Given how big of a deal smoke and flash placement is in CS, this may prove to be problematic in the long term, as it&#x2019;s going to reduce the accuracy with which banked grenades can be placed. Also on the topic of small, maybe-unintentional changes, the spawn locations have shifted slightly. A <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/75lq72/new_dust_2_feedback_and_bugs_megathread_13607rc1/do757d6/""> helpful redditor </a> has pointed out after exploring the map that counter-terrorists can now get to their side of A long a full two seconds before terrorists can get to theirs, which may impact which corners CT players choose to hold, and which angles T players choose to peek from. Again, these are the kind of changes that will require some time to shake out, and we won&#x2019;t know the full effect of this stuff until the competitive meta has fully adapted, which may take even longer than usual given there&apos;s a decade-plus of habits to unlearn. But Valve seems to have struck a good balance with this update. It&#x2019;s a healthy overhaul that makes some modest but interesting changes without reinventing the wheel. From a purely visual perspective, the new Dust 2 is beautiful, and undeniably an upgrade from the previous iteration. The terrorists have also gotten new higher-fidelity player models as part of the deal, and they&#x2019;re a big improvement over the dated look of the existing models. (Puzzlingly, the CT models have not gotten the same treatment thus far.) There are of course a host of bugs related to the new geometry, allowing for all manner of unintentional boost spots and weird clipping, but this has always been the case with these big map refreshes, and generally they get fixed in a fairly timely manner. Once these issues are addressed, we should expect to see Dust 2 re-added to the Active Duty map pool (possibly at the expense of Cobblestone) and the tournament circuit will quickly demonstrate what effect, if any, the update will have on the way Counter-Strike&...",1507917240,

10,The best reload animations,"A reload is a seconds-long sideshow of watching ammo numbers go back up, a firearm equivalent of <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-hand-animations-in-first-person-games/""> wiping the blood </a> off a blade. Whether it&#x2019;s the snappy accuracy of a mil-sim mag swap or feeding vomit balls to a living rocket launcher, reload animations are testament to the artistic prowess of personalizing a ubiquitous aspect of shooters. In alphabetical order, here&#x2019;s some of the best reload animations on PC. Battlefield 1 - Gewehr 98 Battlefield&#x2019;s reloads mix function with form to spruce up each kit&#x2019;s arsenal without straying too far into prolonged five-finger theatrics. The bolt-action rifles have satisfyingly crisp rechambering sequences, and it&#x2019;s wonderful picking out DICE&#x2019;s split-second touches on the older weapon design. The left hand of this Gewehr 98 sniper clamping over the rifle&#x2019;s port to prevent an unspent bullet from flying out as he cycles the bolt to reload is a fine example.&#xA0; Battlefield 1 - Kolibri&#xA0; Behold the pee-wee Kolibri, the tiniest sidearm in a game filled with bulky, ancient MGs and hulking tanks. This novelty pistol has perhaps daintiest reload animation in gaming history. Swapping a magazine smaller than some caterpillars (the slight wiggle before the magazine enters its housing is a hilarious nudge) perfectly accompanies the sophistication of the pinky, ring, and middle fingers raised at maximum teacup clearance.&#xA0; Battlefield 4 - AK-12 Diverging from typical FPS fare of tilting the gun sideways for a clearer view of a reload, Battlefield 4&#x2019;s AK-12 instead scores points for sticking with the realism of a trained military soldier dispensing with unnecessary movements. Note the forward-facing angle during the entire animation&#x2014;this keeps the barrel&#x2019;s business end pointed at the enemy&#x2014;and the support hand curving beneath the grip to rack the charging handle and keep the firing hand near the trigger. <em>(gif via </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL0hNvamUfM""> <em>Jarek the Gaming Dragon</em> </a><em>)</em> Battlefield 4 - AN-94 &#xA0;The AN-94 provides another AK-style reload with a much flashier &#x201C;mag-pop&#x201D; sequence that both seems terribly wasteful and oddly celebratory at the same time, almost as if it&#x2019;s the gun version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2MiFvGPMo""> sabering champagne </a>. <em>(gif via </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM_PXAd_WwQ""> <em>Static Gaming</em> </a><em>)</em> Battlefield 4 - Unica 6 Catching one of DICE&#x2019;s handful of easter-egg reload animations guarantees a double-take and that special feeling of accomplishment for triggering the fabled 1-in-10,000 probability. The Unica 6 secret reload is one of the earliest recorded from Battlefield&#x2019;s community, and it holds a special place of honor for its ridiculous speedloader flick and follow-up cartridge comfort pat. <em>&#xA0;(gif via </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC5gK3lZJl4""> <em>Shimytangtang)</em> </a> Battlefield Hardline - .410 Jury Battlefield Hardline boasts plenty of hidden reload animations seemingly trying to upstage each other with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG2SXoSxT8Y""> increasing </a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21a3Cbr6zI""> ridiculousness </a>. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHpyOgCkfAI""> Levitating an AK magazine </a> with powerful criminal magic is impressive enough, but it&#x2019;s hard to top the mesmerizing smoothness of the twirling .410 Jury and its gunslinger savant performing some extremity ballet. <em>(gif via </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4O9lVst7Q""> <em>Gibs O Matic</em> </a><em>)</em> BioShock - Grenade Launcher Everyone&#x2019;s favorite objectivist dystopia beneath the sea is a playground of art-deco architecture and hybrid steampunk weaponry&#x2014;and then there&#x2019;s the Grenade Launcher which looks like something the Home Alone kid slapped together in his garage. Its rough reload gives weight to its explosive power; you practically break the thing in half to shove in another coffee can&#x2019;s worth of grenades into its metal gullet. Borderlands 2 - Tediore Borderlands 2&apos;s zillion guns follow a small pattern of reload animations based on each manufacturer. For Tediore, it involves chucking the entire gun like a slab of beef (with obligatory explosion) before generating a new one right in your hands. And yes, there&#x2019;s entire character builds centered on <a href=""https://youtu.be/QBurw__ZyTY?t=43""> throwing out as many Tediores as possible </a>. Call of Duty: Black Ops - G11 The few prototype guns found in Black Ops&#x2019; Cold War-era arsenal are a refreshing change from the cookie-cutter animations pasted across nearly every Call of Duty, and the G11 assault rifle nails that conceptual feeling best with its caseless rod reload and cocking handle crank that wouldn&#x2019;t look out of place on a windup toy. <em>(gif via </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUv3jn28SBY""> <em>Undeath92</em> </a><em>)</em> Crysis 2 No single weapon in Crysis 2 sports an interesting reload, but each Nanosuit mode changes how Prophet rearms himself with suitably subtle animation changes. If you&#x2019;re in power mode, you&#x2019;ll slam in magazines with gusto and cock the handle with a firm grip. In stealth mode, you&#x2019;ll more gingerly swap magazines and slowly bring back the handle so it makes less noise. Maximum context. Counter-Strike 1.6 - M4 Surprising detail and nuance, for the time. The classic one-two of the open-palm mag-tap and fantastically inaccurate forward assist yank was a common occurrence when spectating a ...",1482340435,
10,Why I love total conversion mods,"Some of the best games I&apos;ve ever played aren&apos;t games at all. That is to say: some of my fondest gaming memories have come courtesy of total conversion mods&#x2014;modifications which take some of the best and most well-known classics and radically transform them into new and exciting things. I imagine most of you will have played at least one total conversion at some point in your gaming careers, but Chris&apos; list of <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-total-conversion-mods-ever/"">the best total conversion mods ever</a> gathers a large number of my own favourites and may point some of you towards mods you haven&apos;t yet played.&#xA0; The benefits of total conversion mods are probably pretty obvious. First and foremost, they extend the time spent wandering our favourite game worlds; and quite often offer players the chance to visit new realms and arenas tied to the games in question. These scenarios tend to be dreamt up by hobbyist modders&#x2014;people who, like you, are fans of the relevant series. The best total conversions therefore portray likely circumstances and credible characters which complement their source material.&#xA0; What I love most about total conversion mods is tied to that last part. As hobbyists, the folk behind these projects create them for free&#x2014;at times designing worlds similar in scope and size to big budget games, fitting development time around full-time employment among other real life distractions. Many have went on to earn cash from their endeavours eventually, but the vast majority of developers start out driven by passion alone. Over the years I&apos;ve chatted to a few of the devs responsible for some of my favourite total conversions and it&apos;s their stories which have been among the most interesting I&apos;ve ever heard.&#xA0; Minh Le is a name some of you will know well. Le, who otherwise goes by the pseudonym Gooseman, is a freelance programmer, modeller and designer for Facepunch Studios&apos; open-world survival game Rust&#x2014;however also co-founded the one-time Half-Life mod Counter-Strike with Jesse Cliffe in 1999.&#xA0; As I&apos;m sure most of you are aware, Counter-Strike has gone onto become pretty popular, however it wasn&apos;t until last year that I discovered Le and Cliffe spent the first three years of their respective Valve careers without actually meeting in person. When Valve approached the duo about acquiring the mod they&apos;d crafted using the original Half-Life GoldSource engine, Le moved from Canada to Valve&apos;s Seattle HQ while Cliffe spent the next few years finishing school. It was only after this time that Le and Cliffe were ever in the same room together.&#xA0; Valve&apos;s GoldSource engine and its Half-Life 2 Source engine have been responsible for a number of other total conversion success stories. Garry&apos;s Mod celebrates ten years on Steam this year and has seen its community grow exponentially&#x2014;not to mention its multitude of user-made game modes&#x2014;in that time. Unlike Counter-Strike&apos;s more focused beginnings, Garry Newman designed the sandbox game which would eventually allow him to take up game development full-time as a result of messing around with the Source engine and a desire to see how far he could push it.&#xA0; Newman learned coding on the job and in a chat earlier this year told me that without Source Control pre-release, GMod game crashes meant he was forced to bin all previous work and start the entire game from scratch every time he encountered bug-related problems. Further crashes meant repeating this process and then hoping for the best in the next run. Other total conversion stories of intrigue include <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/sven-co-op-the-half-life-based-multiplayer-game-is-now-live-on-steam/"">Sven Co-op</a>, another Half-Life mod which, although created in 1999, was continually developed and iterated on before finding its way onto Steam for free earlier this year. The prolific and super efficient work of Elder Scrolls enthusiasts and hobbyist modders SureAI has seen the likes of Nehrim and <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/enderal/"">Enderal</a> come to be&#x2014;both hugely impressive Oblivion and Skyrim mods which are arguably as good, or at least equally as ambitious, as their source material.&#xA0; XCOM: Enemy Unknown&apos;s ultra-challenging Long War total conversion mod is another of my own personal favourites about which creator <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/how-one-xcom-mod-spawned-a-development-studio/"">John Lumpkin told me back in July</a>: &#x201C;Last September, I went to the Firaxis offices when they were in the fairly late stages of polishing XCOM 2. I met Jake Solomon there and showed him what XCOM: Enemy Unknown modding looked like. He wondered aloud if I had closets full of chains and leather.&#x201D; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; He doesn&apos;t, it turns out, but Lumpkin&apos;s story&#x2014;not to mention those touched upon above&#x2014;is but one of thousands of interesting anecdotes behind some of the most outstanding mods-cum-games I&apos;ve ever played. Furthermore, the dedicated communities these mods have inspired make the mods themselves even more inspiring in my book. Again, <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-total-conversion-mods-ever/"">Chris&apos; &apos;best of&apos; list</a> is well worth checking out, and I&ap...",1481138143,
10,Someone's modding CS 1.6 into CS:GO,"Counter-Strike: Classic Offensive is a remake of Counter-Strike being made inside a remake of Counter-Strike. Yesterday the modder <a href=""http://www.moddb.com/members/z00l/mods"" target=""_blank"">Z00L</a> released a launch trailer for his curious mod, a project that aims to reproduce the look and feel of the original Counter-Strike (version &apos;1.6&apos; as it&apos;s more colloquially known) inside CS:GO. &quot;The main goal of the mod is to get the gameplay from 1.6 right into CS:GO including weapons, sounds, movement, all the old stuff you&apos;ve dreamed to see in CS:GO,&quot; he writes on ModDB. &quot;As you can see, I&apos;m pretty near.&quot; The mod is built within CS:GO&apos;s version of Source, and it&apos;ll require CS:GO to play. At launch, planned December 25, Z00L says that retro versions of Dust2, Italy, Mirage and Inferno will be playable. Each of these maps exist in the current version of CS:GO, of course, but they&apos;ve since been aesthetically and structurally reimagined in small or significant ways.&#xA0; As stated <a href=""http://www.moddb.com/mods/counter-strike-classic-offensive/news/counter-strike-classic-offensive-whats-that"" target=""_blank"">in August</a>, Z00L&apos;s goals with the project are to make weapons that behave similarly to 1.6, remove &apos;GO&apos;-specific guns, replace all sounds, and remove skins. He also outlines what he <em>is not</em> able to do as a result of the engine: * <em>Wallbangs as in 1.6 (even if I change it it won&apos;t penetrate more than 32units)</em>; * <em>Remake the crouching jumping bug (no I won&apos;t edit the dlls)</em>; * <em>Playermodel selection (a plugin could fix that though)</em>; * <em>See inside smoke particles (the game don&apos;t draw the world when inside, so nope..)</em>; * <em>Bring back the tactical shield</em>; * <em>Change flashes, smoke time, nade physics</em>; * <em>Add buying ammo </em>; So although the project is appetizing to folks like me who grew up playing 1.6 in internet cafes, it does seem to be operating under some fundamental constraints that might make it impossible to include certain movement quirks and &apos;desirable&apos; map bugs what were buffed out over Counter-Strike&apos;s different iterations. It&apos;s hard to tell from the in-game trailer exactly how well Classic Offensive captures the movement and weapon feel of old CS, but to my eyes it resembles the higher-fi Counter-Strike: Source more than anything. I guess that isn&apos;t unsurprising, considering it&apos;s the link between 1.6 and GO. Which version of Counter-Strike was the best, the most pure, or the most tactically interesting remains a hotly debated topic by FPS players. For the year following its release in 2012, <a href=""http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1341126000000&amp;to=End+Time"" target=""_blank"">CS:GO wasn&#x2019;t even the most popular version of Counter-Strike</a>&#x2014;some players were still <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/1ibjad/16_players_why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_csgo/"">actively arguing</a> the merits of GO against its thirteen- and nine-year-old predecessors.

10,Counter-Strike's Inferno map gets revised and redecorated,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's esteemed Inferno map has been given a fresh lick of paint and a host structural renovations bringing its 2012 design in-line with the world of today. In doing so, three main areas have been the focus of improvement: to advance visibility across the map; to make it easier to move around in groups; and to ""fine-tune the gameplay based on community feedback."" Fresh from a stint in its beta phase, the new slant on Inferno is now available to all in the Reserves Map Group, and Valve is keen for Counter-Strikers to test it out and file feedback. Full details on what's been changed and why can be <a href=""http://www.counter-strike.net/inferno/"">found here</a>, but you can check out how each area has been reworked via the sliders below. Bombsite A ""We focused on increasing the readability of positions, and giving the attackers more ways to utilize their equipment such as smoke grenades and flashbangs before entering the site itself. ""The overhanging roof on the site was removed, letting more natural light flow in. This also makes sniping between library and balcony more viable for both sides, and allows you to land smoke grenades on the site itself. ""The infamous truck that served as the path onto balcony has been replaced with a simpler cart, which has a more solid shape making gameplay more manageable, and makes navigating onto the balcony easier. ""The upper platform features improved visibility, with less parallaxing geometry for attackers to sift through to be able to spot a defender."" ""In addition to these changes, the path leading to balcony has now been opened up, to allow attackers to flashbang into site before exposing themselves. This forces a defender playing from pit to stay alert. ""Another change inside of apartments is the removal of the 'dark' bedroom. This room was a very powerful defensive position for CTs, and Ts would be forced to use some of their grenades in clearing it before even reaching the site. ""This has been changed to a cubby (similar to the 1.6 version of Inferno), which is easier to check, but remains a powerful position for a defender."" Bombsite B ""The final stretch leading into the bombsite has been widened, along with giving Terrorists some additional cover before committing to the site itself. ""The skybox in this area has been tweaked as well, it no longer allows CTs to smoke off B site from other areas of the map. ""On the site itself, there have been some changes. The gap between 'newbox' and the pillar has been closed off, the position near the entrance to the site is now climbable and visibility in general has been improved."" Middle ""The biggest change in the middle of the map is that the underpass connecting middle and alt-mid is now halfway walkable. You still need to crouch to be able to enter from middle, but about halfway through the tunnel you are able to walk upright. ""Another minor, but impactful change; the lightpole that has absorbed millions of bullets over the years has been removed, so there is one less object to blame if you miss your shot."" T Spawn ""The T Spawn now finally has its second exit opened up, which puts you directly into alt-mid."" Valve <a href=""http://www.counter-strike.net/inferno/"">signs off the update</a> with the following: ""While there have been upgrades and adjustments throughout the map, the core gameplay remains more or less the same. By releasing the new Inferno early as a beta we were able to collect valuable player feedback and made many fixes ahead of this official release. ""Thank you to those who contributed. We will continue to observe the gameplay and make tweaks and fine-tune the map as we collect more feedback."" ",1476463172,

Since ending his playing career in 2012 he has stayed active in the CS:GO scene as part of the media.</em> The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world&nbsp;you need clear,&nbsp;specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events&mdash;no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players current form. Before we dig in, let s first take a look at some of the big names who barely missed the cut of being in the top ten. Recent fan favorite Nikola NiKo Kovac did not make this list because he has not performed at enough events yet. Richard shox Papillon came close, and in Titan he might regain the kind of role that will allow him a spot on the list, but currently he must be left out. Finally, NiP s Christopher GeT_RiGhT Alesund s Dubai performance was incredible, but it is not enough after six-plus months of, for him, average play. You could also have made a case for Rene cajunb Borg, who has been TSM s second best player for a long time, and like shox and GeT_RiGhT, boast a strong individual track record at the majors. <em>Photo via the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/eslphotos/"">ESL Flickr</a> page</em> 10. Kenny 'kennyS' Schrub <strong>France |&nbsp;Team&nbsp;EnVyUs</strong> In late 2014 and early 2015 kennyS was arguably the number one player in the world as the game s most dominant AWPer. Despite playing on a team barely in the top eight, he constantly put up performances that allowed Titan to compete with all of the world s best teams, and even score some strong tournament finishes. Since the AWP update he hasn t been as dominant, and it is possible the limited, in comparison, role he has on EnVy will never allow him to regain the top spot.

Some of the statlines s1mple put together while playing in a tactical, but not very skilled F3 team are absurd.

For one, he has the best stats overall across all the CS:GO majors to-date, and he is one of just three players ever to three majors&mdash;and one of five to win two.

10,Aces high! Amazing CS:GO moments at DreamHack London,"Happy looking happy&nbsp;after Juan good round. Photo credit: DreamHack/Adela Szjnader. When it comes down to a final between two top-tier heavyweights, you expect all of your players to be on form&mdash;but&nbsp;when no less than four out of ten finalists close out rounds by killing <em>every member of the enemy team by themselves</em>, you ve found something special. The climax of this weekend s DreamHack London was one such occasion, as French team EnVyUs edged out Danish rivals Team SoloMid in a 2-0 stormer. The pair were the two most-highly seeded squads at the two-day event, so there was little surprise that they found their way to opposite sides of the final bracket. Resistance along the way came in the form of Copenhagen Wolves new roster, their old roster (now belonging to Team Dignitas with few modifications), SK Gaming, the Australian upstarts Renegade and&mdash;owing to the London location&mdash;two British teams: Gamers2 and EZSkins. The British are leaving: KennyS' amazing AWP triple As the final attests, resistance was futile&mdash;particularly for the ailing UK CS scene.

Even former CS 1.6 and Source legends such as EZSkins Sam RattlesnK Gawn were no match for the inhuman AWPing skills of EnVy s latest addition Kenny KennyS Schrub. Assassin's creed: twist's acrobatic Glock headshot One team proving to at least resemble a thorn in both finalists sides was Copenhagen Wolves, managing to take second in TSM s group and coming up against EnVy in the semifinals. It s not much consolation for the squad, who lost convincingly to both teams, but CW s Simon twist Eliasson can be proud of what was the most unexpected play of the Sunday before the final began. Hopping off the B-site balcony on Mirage and showing some air control worthy of any Surf practice maps, the Swede lands a headshot on poor unsuspecting Nathan NBK- Schmitt to prove that the Wolves still have some bite. Down to the wire: Kio's almost-flawless victory However, after the lights dimmed and the final teams got serious on the Copper Box Arena s main stage, much of the weekend s action seemed to pale in comparison. The first indicator of which was EnVy s second round win on Dust II, having lost the pistol round. Halting TSM s early economic lead by wiping them out and taking their hard-earned guns prevented the usual snowball scenario of the pistol-round winner taking two or three more in a row. As such, the entire first half was kept incredibly close, with EnVy finishing ahead at 9-6. Heading into the second half pistol round with EnVy on the Counter-Terrorist side, the magic began as Fabien 'Kioshima' Fiey pulled off the first ace of the proceedings, only to lose the round as he ran out of time to defuse. Stay cool: Kioshima's burning sacrifice A mistake Kio made sure to rectify a mere 11 rounds later, to put EnVy into a strong match-point position. Having worked his way masterfully onto the A-site again, dispatching cajunB and safe in the knowledge that Karrigan was too low on health to risk a peek, he sets about defusing. Karrigan s elegant solution was to molotov the entire bomb area from safety. But Kio simply wasn t about to leave a job half done again and gives his life for the cause, as the final tick of burn damage kills him a fraction of a second after the defuse finishes. Swarm of bullets: Karrigan's revenge ace Having sent a strong statement by&nbsp;closing out Dust II 16-13, EnVy went about leaving their mark on Inferno too in the second map of the best-of-three. This time, winning the pistol round and following through with a natural economic advantage on the next two left them with a healthy 3-0 lead. Stepping up to the plate&mdash;and making up for not cooking a hot enough molotov in the last map&mdash;Finn 'Karrigan' Andersen threw down the second ace of the finals, mopping up the mess left on mid by teammate cajunB s perfectly timed grenade. Juan in a million: Happy's Desert Eagle rampage Match&nbsp;balance restored by Karrigan's ace,&nbsp;things remained square until well into the second half as EnVy took up defensive positions as Counter-Terrorists. Having let TSM back into the game and lost the second pistol round, they were struggling to find purchase and embarked on an&nbsp;'eco' round to save money for later. Completely undeterred by this situation, and&nbsp;with Desert Eagle in hand, Vincent 'Happy' Schopenhauer landed an impossible ace, with four near-perfect 'Juan Deag' single-tap headshots. Oh, snap: KennyS' lightning AWP reactions Spurred on by the heroics of his team-mate, and despite a losing streak after Happy s rampage, KennyS found the fourth ace of the night for EnVy to regain momentum. Not sated by that, he then went on an extremely aggressive push up into apartments with the AWP in order to land a snapshot so fast...",1442948400,
10,Understanding the big changes in CS:GO's latest patch,"TRIGGERNOMETRY We write about FPSes each week in <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/triggernometry"" target=""_blank"">Triggernometry</a>, a mixture of tips, esports,&nbsp;and a celebration of virtual marksmanship. Beneath Counter-Strike s skin is a skeleton of interconnected systems: movement, location-specific damage modeling, and weapon behavior, to name a few. In last week s <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-gets-new-animations-and-hitboxes/"">major patch release</a> Valve swapped out some significant bones in that skeleton. With a foundation built on a decades-old legacy favoring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtGQnyPZ6g"">tradition</a> over radical change, CS:GO s community has appraised this update as nothing short of historic. Beyond bug fixes, the meat of the patch delivers significant adjustments to CS:GO s steadfast core: hitboxes, animations, and weapon behavior. Here s how these changes affect the game&mdash;for casuals, pros, and <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/how-400-virtual-knives-saved-counter-strike/"">skin-conomists</a> alike&mdash;and why they re important milestones in one of PC gaming s most storied shooters. Hitbox comparison image&nbsp; <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/egnKn"">by imgur user whats0n </a> Hitboxes CS:GO s long-lasting cuboid hitboxes&mdash;the invisible, body-hugging shapes critically governing bullet hit detection&mdash;has morphed into a capsule set with a more cylindrical configuration that better covers each part of the CT and T model. Each cylinder conforms to the body model s shape more closely than the hard edges of a cube, and the entire set provides a higher degree of overlap for accordingly increased precision in determining where incoming bullets should land (and, subsequently, how much damage is meted out). Valve also fixed inconsistent hitbox alignment that tended to crop up during certain movements such as jumping or hanging on ladders by forcing hitbox rigs to continuously shape to whatever motion the model is performing at all times: running, standing still, climbing, planting the bomb, and so on. <strong>Why it matters: </strong>At long last Valve has repaired CS:GO s an issue that s plagued the community for years. Dozens of demonstrations of misaligned hitboxes filled <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/search/?q=hitbox&amp;gidforum=882957625821686010&amp;include_deleted=1&amp;p=16"">forum threads</a> and <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3glktz/the_problem_of_csgo_hitbox_system/"">Reddit posts</a>. Some examples were <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXsHqe5dtuQ"">hilariously blatant</a>, some were more <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snZqkGJQ3qM"">analytical</a>, but they all pointed to a harmful obstacle of CS:GO s layers of strategy and skill. The now-continually synchronized hitboxes ensures shots will land precisely where they re sent to, and we can finally send a farewell salute to the unwelcome <a href=""http://gfycat.com/UnlinedCavernousDesertpupfish"">immortal bomb-planter</a>. One interesting phenomenon to note is how the development and proliferation of the professional scene flourished in the face of faulty hitboxes. Pro teams, by virtue of their intimate knowledge of each minute aspect of the game, were acutely aware of how hit detection affected performance; they simply adapted and got used to it. Teams with star-led rosters such as Fnatic and EnVyUs will re-adapt in short time, but it ll be interesting to observe the process of unlearning years of habits. In theory, position control should turn even more rewarding for quick multi-frags with steady spray. Given the heightened payoff for shooting accuracy, 1v1 encounters will swing towards whoever is on the draw the fastest for tapping shots into the larger head hit-bubble. No longer is jump-peeking a safeguarded method for gathering intel, as it s now an exposing move with a heavy risk of a blink-and-gone <a href=""http://gfycat.com/PolishedSlipperyApisdorsatalaboriosa"">reflex kill</a>. Animations New and improved animations for the worldview character model (the models of teammates and enemy players seen from your view) smooths out walking/running cycles and gives more natural physical behavior to the weapons and equipment adorning each model. In particular, full draw animations replace the former, jerky ones for guns and grenades, and switching items plays a neat holster sequence for whatever s being put away.&nbsp; <a href=""http://gfycat.com/ShorttermImpeccableArcticduck"">Ladder climbing looks better</a> but still hasn t lost the comedic awkwardness of watching someone sprinting up a vertical surface while gripping a rifle with both hands. Player and weapon models will also cull when up against a thin wall or doorway. That means any portion of the model that would stick out is automatically cut away to avoid erroneous clipping and unintentional giveaways from simply standing too close. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Though mostly cosmetic, the new animations better represent what a spotted player is doing moment to moment. Stronger-colored defusal kits are easier to pick out on the model, and cleaner-looking transitions to secondaries impart an important sign that an opponent s primary has run dry. Reports of <a href=""http://gfycat.com/TediousLankyIbisbill"">distorted models</a> and players <a href=""http://gfycat.com/LikableNeatArmedcrab"">flopping on the ground</a> have also surfaced in the days following the update. Model culling is a pretty significant boon for ambush-oriented players parking up against high-traffic chokepoints such as Nuke s squeaky and Dust 2 s double doors. It doesn t completely cover all angles&mdash;the tight corners of Inferno s banana still occasionally betray a popped-out barrel or two, for instance&mdash;but it does add fair variability to close-quarter positions typically avoided for wonky clipping. In a way it s more of a buff for the Terrorists, who now have to worry less about their barrels stick...",1442869162,
10,How $400 virtual knives saved Counter-Strike,"The Bayonet&nbsp;Crimson Web skin is worth&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-expensive-csgo-skins/"">thousands</a>. CS:GO s massive popularity eclipses its bizarre history.&nbsp;More than 8 million people play Counter-Strike every month. The average number of people playing CS:GO in August (357,535) was an incredible <a href=""http://steamcharts.com/app/730"">14 times greater</a> than it was two years ago (25,961). Even Team Fortress 2, at the peak of its popularity, drew <a href=""http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;appid=730q240q10q440&amp;from=0"">less than one-fifth</a> of the concurrent players that CS:GO does today. But if you crane your neck around the massive <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLLoeaxPsqU"">conga line</a> of people who have discovered Global Offensive, you ll remember that, <em>oh right</em>, it was born as a port&mdash;partly meant to put Counter-Strike onto the previous generation of consoles before the end of their lifespan. When Valve and Hidden Path brought CS:GO to PAX in 2011 <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pax-2011-counter-strike-global-offensive-hands-on-preview-new-gear/1100-6331709/"">they demoed it exclusively on Xbox 360</a> and talked up, no joke, cross-platform play between PC and PS3 as a major feature (which was <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-global-offensive-to-arrive-this-summer-cross-platform-play-dropped/"">cut before release</a>). In 2012 it wasn t especially clear that Valve, who did not reply to a request for comment for this story, intended to dedicate significant resources to Global Offensive post-launch (memes about <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2ywzfi/valve_time/"">the seemingly modest size</a> of Valve s CS:GO team were still being kicked around six months ago). Most of the production of CS:GO was done by Hidden Path, also known for the <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/defense-grid-2-review/"">Defense Grid</a> series, who had about 30 people working on it before release. Valve's involvement grew continually during the final pre-launch phase, as Hidden Path CEO Jeff Pobst told me. The Glock Fade skin is worth about&nbsp;<a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Glock-18%20%7C%20Fade%20(Factory%20New)"">$260</a>. When I reached out to Hidden Path talk about CS:GO s origins, Pobst shed light on an the biggest challenge that CS:GO faced before release: how to unify the deeply entrenched Source and CS 1.6 communities under a single game. Initially we started working with the Valve folks to bring CS:S to console. The project grew over time to become something much larger because the folks at Valve were really interested in exploring if there was anything that could be done to try to bring together the two existing groups of CS players, said Pobst. Hidden Path and Valve faced a daunting task: making everyone happy. Appeasing not one, but two communities who are resistant to change is difficult enough without also having to woo people who didn t grow up on Counter-Strike. There were players who felt that CS 1.6 was a superior experience for their play style and there were other players who felt like CS:S was the best game for their play style, says Pobst. Sadly those two groups were very segmented and didn t play together. We started having a lot of discussions with Valve about what a product might look like&mdash;if it was even possible&mdash;that would become the favorite version of Counter-Strike for both existing player groups as well as for new players. And that was the main design focus behind most every decision that went into the development of CS:GO. Fresh&nbsp;paint Plenty of people did play CS:GO when it came out, but did not show hints of becoming the sensation that it is today for some time. <a href=""http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1341126000000&amp;to=End+Time"">For a year after release, CS:GO wasn t even the most popular version of Counter-Strike</a>&mdash;some players were still <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/1ibjad/16_players_why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_csgo/"">actively debating</a> the merits of GO against its thirteen- and nine-year-old predecessors. What changed? Weapon skins. Almost exactly <a href=""http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2013/08/7425/"">a year after release</a>, Valve introduced Team Fortress 2-style weapon drops to CS:GO, an event that coincides with the game <a href=""http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=730q240q10&amp;from=1372662000000&amp;to=1383202800000"">permanently overtaking</a> its older siblings. This&nbsp;design decision put CS:GO on the trajectory to being the most popular game on Steam that isn t Dota 2. As ex-pro Tomi lurppis Kovanen puts it, Without the item economy Counter-Strike would be smaller. We would likely be at a level slightly above that of late 2013, and one similar to the peak years of Counter-Strike 1.6. There would be less money, no Valve-sponsored majors, and no one-million-viewer grand finals, says Kovanen, who contributes to&nbsp;PC Gamer. In hindsight, the addition of the skins has been the most important development in CS:GO's history, bar none. The addition of the skins has been the most important development in CS:GO's history.

Part of the explanation lies in how elegantly these decorated guns and knives integrate with fundamental aspects of Counter-Strike despite being purely cosmetic things. Something mostly unique to Counter-Strike, for example, is how much time you spend watching others play it. Death comes easily, and once slain you re pushed into someone else s eye sockets, where you re forced to gaze upon the ballistic eye candy of their painted guns.&nbsp; Wooden replicas of some of&nbsp;CS:GO's most coveted virtual&nbsp;knives, by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3gyuum/some_csgo_knifes_made_from_plywood/"">SeaNTea</a>.

10,"The most expensive CS:GO skins: guns, knives, and stickers","CS:GO skins and all other Steam Market items are subject to a $400 maximum listing price. Items are often sold for greater sums through key trades, a sub-currency of the CS:GO economy. A single CS:GO key costs $2.50 USD and can be sold on the Steam Marketplace. To break through the $400 ceiling, you convert your listing price to a key value. If you want to sell an item for $500, divide your listing price by the key value, 500 by 2.5: 200 keys. Most people use third-party trading websites to list CS:GO s rarest wares, but once a trade is made, those keys can be sold back into the Steam Marketplace. There are some skins in our list that definitely break that cap, but due to both the extraordinary rarity of these items and their inconsistent prices in the key market, we ve pulled our best estimates from varying trading sites.

10,How to AWP: mastering Counter-Strike's iconic rifle,"Tennis players know the peculiar feeling of zenlike calm and control that comes with starting a serve. Suddenly, all worries about footwork, planning drop shots, and recovering from an opponent s serve dissipate: the pace of the game rests in the palm of your hand. Wielding Counter-Strike s deadliest gun is a little like that. Like a great tennis player, talented AWPers have a mixture of patience and confidence. They tap into a slow mindset and lightning reflexes simultaneously. The AWP is an intimidator, both when it s pointed at you and when you re learning the weapon. Carrying an AWP isn t simply an equipment decision, but a discipline in and of itself with its own set of techniques, guidelines, and pitfalls. The basics of the AWP The AWP is heavy, powerful, and expensive. Its reputation arises from the fact that, in a game about eliminating other players from the round, it s the only weapon that can kill someone with one body shot. However, it isn t a one-hit kill in all circumstances, as leg and lower groin shots deal 85 damage (aka legging ), as do shots that clip through surfaces such as railings or corners. With the AWP s great power comes equal responsibility. Whether in a 5-on-5 competitive game or in casual mode, you ll put down $4,750 to buy an AWP. If that investment doesn t pay off (or worse, if an opponent kills you and steals it), it can break your team s economy for rounds to come. Other than the autosniper (aka the G3SG1/SCAR-20), the same can t be said for other investments in CS:GO. Certain aspects of the AWP make it unwieldy to the newcomer, including its effect on mobility. A player running with the knife moves at 250 units per second; with a USP-S, 240 units per second; with the AK-47, 215; with the AWP, a mere 200 units per second&mdash;20 percent slower than with a knife. Only the light machine guns, the Negev and the M249 (195 units), are slower. The AWP s firerate is equally slow, placing huge importance on hitting your first shot. The Scout, the AWP s cheaper sibling, features a similarly slow firerate but allows for insanely high mobility, even when scoped-in (unlike the AWP). And like many of CS:GO s guns, the AWP is sensitive to movement, requiring near-perfect stillness to execute an accurate shot (see the Advanced Techniques section for more on this). AWPers are thus faced with the dilemma of holding static angles that easily fall prey to flashbangs and pincer-pushes onto bombsites. But the AWP has more advantages still. It boasts the best penetration in-game, both in terms of wall penetration power with a value of 250 (this value ranges from 0-300, with a higher value indicating that a bullet can penetrate <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=275573090"">harder surfaces at longer distances</a>) but also in terms of armor penetration (97.5 out of 100 in the in-game menu, the highest in the game, which in effect nullifies the damage-softening effect of armor). The right combination of guesswork and timing can lead to <a href=""http://gfycat.com/BluePinkBurro"">impossible shots that defy logic</a>. When should I buy an AWP? If you want to buy an AWP in a competitive game, the best time to do it is on the first gun round of the game (typically the fourth round) and when you re carrying at least $5,750. Even if your team has lost the first three rounds, secured zero objectives, and you personally didn t notch a kill over that time, you ll have earned $6,700 total by round four, including your initial $1,000 of starter cash. The most effective AWPer will spend even more to purchase a set of grenades, about $6,450. Here s your shopping list for a solid buy: * AWP - $4,750; * Kevlar &amp; helmet - $1,000; * Two flashbangs and a smoke grenade - $700; Buy an AWP without armor, and you re making a glass cannon buy. It s an enormous risk&mdash;you re turning yourself into a slow-moving cannon with no protection, not only to damage, but to the accuracy-disrupting effects of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aaH6dYTZYU"">aim punch</a>. Avoid AWPing without full armor except in the most desperate straits, like when your opponent is on the verge of winning the match. If your teammate in competitive mode has bought an AWP, reconsider buying another one. There are situations where the map will dictate otherwise (double AWPing as CT on de_dust2 is viable due to its long sight lines on A, B, and mid), but the economic risk is rarely worth the potential gain. In casual mode on the other hand, buying an AWP is merely a matter of buying cheaply for a round or two to save up for Big Green. The two styles of AWPing Broadly, there are two situations in which you ll use an AWP: covering an angle while stationary (passive AWPing), or while roaming (aggressive AWPing). In the professional CS:GO scene, players like Titan s SmithZz and the Danish player nico (who <a href=""http://team-dignitas.net/articles/news/Team-Dignitas/7946/team-dignitas-csgo-schneider-replaces-nico"">was recently replaced on Dignitas</a>) fit into the passive style, while EnVyUs kennyS or Fnatic s JW tend to play aggressively. Passive AWPing best works at corners where you have the option of retreating behind solid cover, where you can protect yourself until the AWP is ready to fire again (e.g...",1442334600,

If that investment doesn t pay off (or worse, if an opponent kills you and steals it), it can break your team s economy for rounds to come. Other than the autosniper (aka the G3SG1/SCAR-20), the same can t be said for other investments in CS:GO. Certain aspects of the AWP make it unwieldy to the newcomer, including its effect on mobility. A player running with the knife moves at 250 units per second; with a USP-S, 240 units per second; with the AK-47, 215; with the AWP, a mere 200 units per second&mdash;20 percent slower than with a knife. Only the light machine guns, the Negev and the M249 (195 units), are slower. The AWP s firerate is equally slow, placing huge importance on hitting your first shot. The Scout, the AWP s cheaper sibling, features a similarly slow firerate but allows for insanely high mobility, even when scoped-in (unlike the AWP). And like many of CS:GO s guns, the AWP is sensitive to movement, requiring near-perfect stillness to execute an accurate shot (see the Advanced Techniques section for more on this). AWPers are thus faced with the dilemma of holding static angles that easily fall prey to flashbangs and pincer-pushes onto bombsites. But the AWP has more advantages still. It boasts the best penetration in-game, both in terms of wall penetration power with a value of 250 (this value ranges from 0-300, with a higher value indicating that a bullet can penetrate <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=275573090"">harder surfaces at longer distances</a>) but also in terms of armor penetration (97.5 out of 100 in the in-game menu, the second-highest in the game, which in effect nullifies the damage-softening effect of armor). The right combination of guesswork and timing can lead to <a href=""http://gfycat.com/BluePinkBurro"">impossible shots that defy logic</a>. When should I buy an AWP? If you want to buy an AWP in a competitive game, the best time to do it is on the first gun round of the game (typically the fourth round) and when you re carrying at least $5,750. Even if your team has lost the first three rounds, secured zero objectives, and you personally didn t notch a kill over that time, you ll have earned $6,500 total by round four, including your initial $800 of starter cash. The most effective AWPer will spend even more to purchase a set of grenades, about $6,450. Here s your shopping list for a solid buy: * AWP - $4,750; * Kevlar &amp; helmet - $1,000; * Two flashbangs and a smoke grenade - $700; Buy an AWP without armor, and you re making a glass cannon buy. It s an enormous risk&mdash;you re turning yourself into a slow-moving cannon with no protection, not only to damage, but to the accuracy-disrupting effects of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aaH6dYTZYU"">aim punch</a>. Avoid AWPing without full armor except in the most desperate straits, like when your opponent is on the verge of winning the match. If your teammate in competitive mode has bought an AWP, reconsider buying another one. There are situations where the map will dictate otherwise (double AWPing as CT on de_dust2 is viable due to its long sight lines on A, B, and mid), but the economic risk is rarely worth the potential gain. In casual mode on the other hand, buying an AWP is merely a matter of buying cheaply for a round or two to save up for Big Green. The two styles of AWPing Broadly, there are two situations in which you ll use an AWP: covering an angle while stationary (passive AWPing), or while roaming (aggressive AWPing). In the professional CS:GO scene, players like Titan s SmithZz and the Danish player nico (who <a href=""http://team-dignitas.net/articles/news/Team-Dignitas/7946/team-dignitas-csgo-schneider-replaces-nico"">was recently replaced on Dignitas</a>) fit into the passive style, while EnVyUs kennyS or Fnatic s JW tend to play aggressively. Passive AWPing best works at corners where you have the option of retreating behind solid cover, where you can protect yourself until the AWP is ready to fire again...",1442334600,

10,What makes a good game gun?,"TRIGGERNOMETRY We write about FPSes each week in <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/show-us-your-rig/"" target=""_blank"">Triggernometry</a>, a mixture of tips, design criticism, and a celebration of virtual marksmanship. There isn t enough poetry being written about guns. Not literal limericks or sonnets (that would be creepy), but words that dig into and capture what makes one game s AK-47 more fun than another s. Weapon feel continues to be the nebulous catch-all for the nuances that make guns fun. Most of the reviews of shooters I read offer the same praise: guns feel great or feel really powerful. If the writer s being generous, they ll use a word like punchy to describe an SMG. I ve been guilty of this too during my six-year term at PC Gamer. Months of work goes into designing, animating, and balancing the things that put the S in FPS, so maybe we should take a moment to talk about what makes a good gun good. I think the visual design of weapons matters far less than we think it does. There s a tendency, probably because they re planted right in front of our perspective at all times, to think of guns as a collection of aesthetics: firing and reload animations, SFX, screen shake, particle effects, and the death animations they produce. Those things make a gun, right? So if those things are good, surely we have an interesting and fun video game weapon, right? No. Consider the&nbsp;<a href=""http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/AWP"">AWP</a>: it s olive green, it s bland, and its simple animations are more run-of-the-mill than Rambo. The only aesthetically remarkable thing about the most revered, iconic, and infamous sniper rifle in a video game is that it s a bit loud. And yet <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2esnhy/valve_we_need_static_sniper_scopes/"">thousand-comment debates</a> erupt when Valve tweaks the way the AWP s scope works. Why? A gun s look and sound are part of its personality, sure. But if you ask me, <strong>great video game weapons have meaningful, interconnected relationships with other game elements</strong>. Those elements differ from game to game, of course. In CS case, the appeal of the AWP is born from the fact that CS is an FPS with body-part-specific damage modeling and no respawns. In that context, it s the only gun that grants an instant kill if you tag someone above the waist. That feeling of possibility is fun within the strict rules of CS movement: if you can hit it, you can kill it&hellip; but you also can t be moving too much when you fire. With that power comes responsibility, too. Killed players surrender their equipped weapon in CS, and stolen AWPs not only save your team $4750 but act as a kind of trophy. This is doubly the case in CS:GO, where a player s custom AWP skin reminds all spectators which irresponsible player allowed their AWP to fall into enemy hands. Buying an AWP, then, to some extent, announces to the rest of the server: I think I m a good enough shot to protect this valuable&nbsp;asset from the other team. All of&nbsp;this makes&nbsp;the AWP a weapon with abundant meaning. Even its shortcomings (slow rate of fire, difficult to use in close quarters) are a source of fun: the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xppyoB36O6E"">noscope</a> is a revered skillshot. In&nbsp;Tribes case, its&nbsp;weapons shake hands with its&nbsp;player movement really well, arguably the quality that defines it as an FPS. Again, like the AWP, the Spinfusor isn't visually extraordinary: it fires discs at a medium speed, and its animations and SFX are pretty modest. But the Spinfusor is the perfect fit, the perfect baseline weapon in a game where your targets are typically skiing along the ground at high speed. Its splash damage leaves room for error and its relatively slow travel time creates an exciting feeling of uncertainty as you admire your shot. Like throwing up a three-pointer in basketball, you get to experience that arc of Will it go in? It might not go in. It went in! as the disc travels toward its target. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_voeB6lEr4"">Fusion Mortar</a> creates the same sort of feeling&nbsp;while operating&nbsp;as a parabolic siege weapon. The design of the weapons actually encourages you to spend as much time as possible in the air: the threat they pose encourages you to master movement to have the best chance of staying alive. In each of these examples, the weapons strengthen the meaning and significance of core systems like&nbsp;movement, damage modeling, or&nbsp;weapon purchasing. ",1418694481,

Good aim can get you out of a bad situation, like a mistimed rush or a weapon disadvantage. Even if you ve been playing CS for a decade, I m willing to bet that, like me, you ve got some bad aiming habits. I ll go first: I m awful with the AK at long range, and I struggle to get kills with the P250 on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-win-eco-rounds-in-csgo/"">eco rounds</a>. I ll probably get better with those guns as I keep putting hours into CS:GO s competitive matchmaking, but bad habits are easy to lose sight of in the middle of a match, when you re caught up in the emotion of the situation. CS:GO also hides a ton of its nuances&mdash;especially the bullet spray patterns of its weapons. Aim maps have a way of immediately illuminating what you ve been doing wrong. Through repetition and drilling, they can teach you a lot about your own bad (and good) aiming behaviors. These are my three favorites. <em>How to play custom CS:GO maps locally:</em> * <em>Subscribe to maps on Steam Workshop</em>; * <em>Launch CS:GO</em>; * <em>Click Play &gt; Offline with bots </em>; * <em>Click Workshop, search for the map you subscribed to</em>; * <em>Select the map, select No bots </em>; training aim csgo 2 <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213240871"">download</a> This is CS:GO s best drill map, and it has a ton of customizability. You can tweak it to test almost anything you need to work on, from long-range AWPing to short-range spraying against targets that take multiple hits to break. I particularly like the sliding test, which lets you set up static or pop-up targets along different axes, letting you practice the rhythm of strafing, stopping, and shooting outside of a live environment. I also get a lot out of the Burst Training, which tracks how many of your shots connect on a full spray. Training: Bot Aim V4b <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=140488121"">download</a> You can work on any weapon on this map, but I ve found it to be best for building pistol skills. It loads a number of bots into a narrow corridor and has a few toggleable obstacles&mdash;crates and a pair of doors&mdash;that you can bring into the setting to make it feel more practical. Bots can be set to return fire or not. The god mode setting is really helpful if you want to focus on training one weapon for a sustained period. aim botz <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660"">download</a> This rifles-and-pistols map is the best one I ve found for working on killing enemies who are moving laterally. The bot movements are a little unnatural (you can also set them to move faster than players can in-game, as in the GIF above), but you can set them to mirror different ADAD patterns (alternating left and right strafing), which can be a particularly tough maneuver to counter. There s a good amount of setting&nbsp;customization, too, including boxes and uneven ground. You can also toggle on impact visualization, which will produce a wireframe of the bot hit that lingers in the environment. <em style=""background-color: initial;""> </em> <em style=""background-color: initial;"">*</em> ",1413239160,

Playing a competitive online game means being subjected to a certain amount of unsolicited criticism. I think you receive a bit more of it in CS:GO, though, because your dead teammates form a kind of peanut gallery who can talk to you from beyond the grave. Being the last one alive as four other players hover over your digital shoulder is a quintessential CS experience. I ve been that digital shoulder hundreds of times, struggling to clutch while a person I ve never met tells me which gun I should grab to retake Nuke s A bombsite, or chastises me for using a grenade in a one-on-one situation. It s annoying, but I m actually grateful for a lot of the harsh feedback that s been handed to me in these moments because it s shaken me out of some bad habits. Below, a selection of some of the criticism that s been condescendingly muttered at me in CS that turned out to be great advice: Don t reload. Shooters, single-player shooters especially, condition us to reload as a Pavlovian response to getting a kill. Resisting that urge is one of the first things most new CS players have to unlearn. Most weapons in CS:GO take between two and four seconds to reload: plenty of time for someone to peek around a corner or move through the space you should be defending. But maybe more importantly, in close-quarters, reloading betrays your position with sound. Consider the trade-off: would you rather have a full mag and an enemy who knows where you are, or a shallow mag and an enemy who s out of position? Don t underestimate how much you can do with four or five bullets. With a rifle, it takes three or four non-headshots to take an enemy from full health to none and in late-game situations, it s even less likely that the enemy around the corner has 100 HP. Don t pretend. A few months ago one of my teammates in a match I d solo queued into called me out on this. What are you doing? I bet you saw that on Twitch or some shit, right? He was right. I was ADAD spamming (quickly tapping A and D in alternation) to hold a corner on de_inferno. There was no purpose or tactical value to what I was doing, I was just miming something I d seen in a tournament. It was the equivalent of doing a bunch of fancy dribbling in soccer with no one playing defense against me. It s great to experiment with stuff you see in competitive play, but understanding the situational benefits of each maneuver is a huge step toward pulling it off successfully. After the ESL, I started backing away from my own flashbang grenades on entries, something I loved seeing in that tournament. But then I realized that my grenade placement wasn t nearly good enough to guarantee that I was flashing enemies at all I was just imitating for the sake of imitating. Please, please don't throw that grenade. Put the pin back in. I see so much misplaced faith in the frag grenade in CS:GO, partly because I used to be that guy who d start a bombsite retake with a frag toss, often coming around corners while still in the follow-through animation for the throw. Here s what I learned, after someone finally scolded me: your frag isn t going to kill anyone. Even if you re the Joe Montana of grenades and toss directly into the enemy player s mouth, it ll do 57 damage. If you played a lot of CS:Source, where grenades did a max of 72 against armored opponents, take a moment to realize that a perfect toss will only inflict as much as about two bullets. In almost all situations, but especially in one-on-ones, your rifle is going to be able to kill someone faster and more safely than any sort of offensive grenade. Flashes are handy in a lot of situations in CS, but they re also unreliable: you can t be sure how well you ve blinded someone. If I had just kept my gun out instead of reaching for that 4 key, I would ve won many more rounds for my team. Don't turn a three-on-one into a series of one-on-ones. This is the one I ve started to preach most to players that I solo queue in Competitive mode with. It s easy to take a round win for granted when you re in a 3-on-1 or a 4-on-2. The easiest way to give away an easy win, though, is arranging your team in a way that the enemy can encounter you one at a time, on their own terms. When you re defending a bombsite against a shorthanded enemy, your goal should be to guarantee a trade: put the enemy in a position where they must cross the firing line of Player B if they want to kill Player A. Are you afraid of your own pistol, or something? Pistols have an amazing amount of utility in CS:GO. In the current build, the CZ75 the only automatic pistol has a ludicrous amount of value as a short-range, spray-and-hope-for-the-best gun when your AWP isn t cutting it or your M4A1-S runs dry. Even with the recent change to price it at $500, the cost of two grenades, it s a strong backup for serial AWPers who fear being rushed. Dude, why would you ever crouch-walk?

Following Katowice earlier this year, the ESL Championship begins 3 AM Eastern on Thursday, the first matches of ESL One Cologne 2014 will kick off in Germany, culminating in a final match on Sunday. Here s the full ESL One Cologne tournament schedule. 16 teams are competing for a $250,000 prize pool, with favorites like NiP, Dignitas, and Virtus.pro matched against challengers, as the ESL teams page puts it, like Copenhagen Wolves, NaVi, and iBuypower. Thursday s matches will determine the seeding of these teams within their four-team groups, with Saturday quarterfinals preceding the semi and grand finals on Sunday. Earlier this week, Valve patched CS:GO to improve the in-client spectating experience a little, allowing you to natively view the game from the perspective of the match s caster. There s also a new camera transition animation that makes swapping between different players perspectives less disorienting. On Twitch, matches should appear on the ESLTV_CS channel.

Following the release of Counter-Strike Online 2 a couple of years ago, Nexon has announced another entry in the series and, naturally, it's themed around zombies. Free-to-play multiplayer FPS Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies will be heading to Steam this Summer/Autumn. It seems that Zombies will mix more traditional CS game modes such as Hostage Rescue and Bomb Diffusion with new ones that will shove zombies in as well. These modes haven't been detailed yet, but Counter-Strike Online's Left 4 Dead-like Zombie Darkness mode might hold a few clues. Valve's Doug Lombardi can hardly contain his excitement: Today we are announcing the latest creation from Nexon in the Counter-Strike world, one that builds upon years of success in developing CS Online for Asia. This title showcases that work in new, zombie, and classic form. Here's hoping Nexon goes the whole hog and chucks in a Portal gun and TF2 characters for their next Counter-Strike game.

10,Why a CS:GO sale hurts CS:GO,"<a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/06/25/why-a-csgo-sale-hurts-csgo/"" rel=""bookmark"" title=""Permanent Link to Why a CS:GO sale hurts CS:GO""> </a> I want more people to play CS:GO. With caveats made for its flaws (64-tick servers, uninspiring stat tracking, the modest number of official maps, and imperfect cheat detection), CS:GO is the best competitive FPS on PC today. Until Evolve or Rainbow Six Siege come around, I expect that to continue uncontested. But for the veteran player, someone who s thrown hundreds of hours at that competitive mode, a CS:GO Steam sale like today s $7.49 / 5.99 until Friday isn t a happy event. It s a harbinger of hackers and competition-souring smurf accounts. CS:GO s price drop is an invitation for those who hack to buy one or several new copies of the game and tie them to new, unique Steam accounts. These secondary accounts insulate your main profile where you keep your game library and everything else that s valuable from the consequences of cheating. We ve recently investigated the seemingly healthy shadow industry of cheating in games like CS:GO, but it s worth underlining how especially disruptive cheating is in the second-most popular game on Steam. What s challenging about hacking in CS:GO is that much of the onus is on the players to report and police themselves, but competitive play makes it inherently difficult or time-consuming to verify a hacker. Naturally, you re not allowed to spectate an opponent mid-match, so if I want to be sure that someone s playing illegitimately, I have to be mad enough to take the time to stop playing, load up my match replay, scrutinize my opponent s actions, report them, and then just trust that the system will catch them. There s no immediate judgment or verification that you caught a hacker; users that receive enough reports, to my understanding, are simply passed along to CS:GO s Overwatch system, where a player (who s recorded at least 150 wins in competitive mode) watches excerpts of the match and makes a judgment. Reporting a hacker is like calling a 911 line that cannot talk back to you. It s an unsatisfying system even when it works, and I m upset knowing that CS:GO s sale will invite more abusers into the system. You also can t simply leave a match to avoid subjecting yourself to a hacker. Abandoning a match for any reason penalizes you, preventing you from playing competitive mode for a period for days at a time, for frequent offenders. But smurf accounts, at least from my experience, are the lesser but more ubiquitous annoyance that a discounted CS:GO stimulates. To the seasoned competitive player, the signs of a smurf are much more obvious than a hacker: you look for a CS:GO profile with very few achievements unlocked or custom weapon skins equipped, tied to a Steam account with CS:GO as its only owned game ( Wow, such dedication. So hardcore, I usually type mockingly when I encounter one of these players). Having one or more smurfs in your match is more subtle disruption but often just as bothersome as hacking: smurf accounts don t receive a rank in the matchmaking system until they ve won 10 games, allowing them to be matched with players that aren t at their true skill level. It s a method of circumventing the matchmaking system (often as a way to play with friends who aren t near the same rank), one not unfamiliar to League of Legends players and other free-to-play games. When I m up against such a player, there s no tool within the reporting system for me to flag their account and why should there be? As far as Valve s concerned, that player is another legitimate customer. Solutions like IP banning would be over-aggressive: what if that account is legitimately a friend or sibling? I want to see the CS:GO community grow, but I bemoan that the game I play most going on sale will probably mean that I'll encounter a few more cheaters and rank-dodging players in the next month or two. To give Valve credit, this isn t the cheapest we ve seen CS:GO. In December, January, and March (the latter coinciding with the EMS One Katowice tournament in Poland), the game was slashed by 75% to just $3.74. The 50% cut over the next two days may be a small compromise, but I don't doubt that it'll invite more players to circumvent matchmaking and play illegitimately.",1403728427,

At any skill level, five-on-five Counter-Strike narrows the range of tactical choices available to you and the time you have to make them, creating a wonderfully concentrated competitive mode. Otherwise, CS:GO is mainly a vehicle for microtransactions: beware the allure of $400 virtual knives. 2 - Tomb Raider 75% off: $4.99 / 3.74 - Steam store page Flash sale: Buy it before 8 p.m. EST Lara Croft returns in a gorgeous action game heavily inspired by Naughty Dog's Uncharted series.

An investigation into aimbot dealers, wallhack users, and the million-dollar business of video game cheating""> </a> Zero is a customer service representative for one of the biggest video game cheat providers in the world. To him, at first, I was just another customer. He told me that the site earns approximately $1.25 million a year, which is how it can afford customer service representatives like him to answer questions over TeamSpeak. His estimate is based on the number of paying users online at any given time, the majority of whom, like me, paid for cheats for one game at $10.95 a month. Some pay more for a premium package with cheats for multiple games. As long as there have been video games, there have been cheaters. For competitive games like Counter-Strike, battling cheaters is an eternal, Sisyphean task. In February, Reddit raised concerns about lines of code in Valve-Anti Cheat (VAC), used for Counter-Strike and dozens of other games on Steam, that looked into users DNS cache. In a statement, Gabe Newell admitted that Valve doesn't like talking about VAC because it creates more opportunities for cheaters to attack the system."" But since online surveillance has been a damning issue lately, he made an exception. Newell explained that there are paid cheat providers that confirm players paid for their product by requiring them to check in with a digital rights management (DRM) server, similar to the way Steam itself has to check in with a server at least once every two weeks. For a limited time, VAC was looking for a partial match to those (non-web) cheat DRM servers in users DNS cache. I knew that cheats existed, but I was shocked that enough people paid for them to warrant DRM. I wanted to find out how the cheating business worked, so I became a cheater myself. That s how I found Zero. After we finished talking, he reminded me to send him the $25 I promised him. I did not at any point say anything that could possibly even suggest that I would pay him for any reason. I asked him if he meant that was something I promised him or something that I should just do. Both, he said. I also advise you not to use this information against me. That wouldn't be wise. How I became a cheating scumbag Bohemia Interactive (Arma, DayZ) believes that only 1 percent of online players are willing to spend money to cheat on top of an already expensive hobby. Even by that estimate, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive alone had a potential 25,000 cheaters out of a total of 2.5 million unique players last month. Put on your green accountant visor, add up the player-bases of all the other popular multiplayer games cheat providers are servicing (Call of Duty, Battlefield, Rising Storm), and you ll see a massively profitable market. I wanted to cheat in CS:GO. I was good, once, when I had a high school student's endless free time to pour into Counter-Strike 1.3. These days, if I can play with friends, it s fun. If I jump onto a random server I m cannon fodder. I Googled Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheats, and quickly ended up at a user-friendly cheat provider. Based on the size of its community and traffic, it s one of the biggest. I'm going to call it Ultra Cheats, a fake name, to protect the anonymity of the sources I talked to. Those sources, like Zero, have also had their online handles altered. Ultra Cheats didn't accept credit (other sites did), so I used PayPal to buy a one-month subscription for CS:GO cheats for $10.95. This gave me access to the site s VIP forums where I could talk to other members, administrators, cheat coders, and download Ultra Cheats cheat loader, which checks in with its DRM server. It also gave me access to around-the-clock technical and customer support via TeamSpeak. I followed a simple list of steps, including disabling Windows default anti-virus protection. I launched a new copy of CS:GO on a fresh Steam account belonging to Perry C. Gamble, loaded the cheat using the cheat loader, and entered a match. For the first time, I wasn't just another player, but a kind of god. The most obvious of my new superhuman abilities was spying on other players through walls. In CS:GO, wallhacking is incredibly useful. Faceoffs around corners come down to millisecond reactions. My ability to see exactly when the enemy was coming, or to know exactly where he was hiding when I was coming, was unfair to say the least. It was also super fun. Maybe the most fun I've had with Counter-Strike in years. I was finally getting kills, more than one in a round, but I wasn't crushing everyone else. It was like a little boost that got me back into my high school fighting shape. I wanted to see how far I could push it. I was paying for this. I wanted to feel powerful and get my money s worth. I turned on auto-aim, and auto-trigger, which fires your weapon automatically when you point your cursor at an enemy. I played with these options and others for a handful of matches. They didn't seem as useful as wallhacking, or they simply didn't work as well, but I was vote-kicked out of a match before I could make an educated decision. Halfway i...",1398862830,

As Valve explains, it is the first completely new defuse map designed with competitive play in mind, and since its release in December 2013, it has been updated seven times based on feedback and data. Take for example the changes made to Bombsite A, which unlike most diffuse maps, is easier to defend from a distance. Retaking the site from the A tunnels was originally very difficult, because defenders could keep tabs on the area from many angles, Valve said in a post on the Counter Strike blog. Move the Terrorist s Target a bit so it s easier to reach from the tunnels, remove a car that was giving Counter Terrorists too much cover, and the area is completely rebalanced. The post details a few of these small but fascinating changes that went into Overpass, and highlights them with fancy, interactive before and after screenshots. It s a good read if you re into Counter-Strike or map design in general. Even better is our three part series from mapmaker Shawn ""FMPONE Snelling and pro Counter-Strike player/mapmaker Sal ""VOLCANO"" Garozzo, which reveals the inspiration and building process for their CS:GO map Crown.",1397162535,

Their goal with Crown is simple: build the best competitive Counter-Strike map ever. In part three, Snelling talks about iteration in map design and listening to community feedback to improve Crown. Releasing de_crown has been a fascinating experience for Volcano and I. When we decided Crown was ready for broader community testing, we released the first public build with the same mixture of anxiety and excitement that always accompanies a new map release. Thankfully, the launch went smoothly! Crown received over 1000 favorites in its first week on the map workshop (the highest rated map on the workshop is over a year old, and has about 1500). Crown ranked within the top five maps of all time virtually overnight. Crown was also the most played map on AltPug s community Matchmaking service during that time period, and the feedback we received there was generally positive. The community was engaged, but Counter-Strike fans are used to playing high quality, nuanced maps with years of competitive polish. This is a high standard for any brand new map to compete with. Not all the news was positive. In public beta testing, several issues were identified which needed fixing, some of which such as the addition of a new path would require major surgery. Generally speaking, I find that that the most effective feedback happens during a dialogue. I like to turn players into problem solvers, since many folks already have brilliant, innovative solutions in mind which I might never have considered. As a result of one such discussion, we added a trick jump to Crown, which you can see below. This trick jump, though easy enough to implement, added a nice layer of richness to the B-Bombsite it s challenging to make the jump successfully, but will allow skilled players to go from lower B to upper B in seconds flat. What are people REALLY saying? Volcano and I participated in playtests and spectated matches anonymously in order to understand how players really felt about Crown, because people typically temper their criticism somewhat when they know they re in the same server as a map creator. We heard lots of people saying Crown felt big and too open, so we added more horizontal details at eye-level and new architectural features designed to bring the map down to scale, in addition to reducing or closing several sightlines. A lot of times, making these gameplay adjustments is positive aesthetically, too: the map feels a lot more natural now. An archway Volcano suggested We also got tons of great feedback about Crown on Reddit. A few common themes about Crown which popped up on r/globaloffensive were that the map s rotation times were too long, the lack of a middle-connector was creating static gameplay, and the map s balance seemed T-sided. It was important for us to immediately make changes to fix these issues. In many instances people took to Photoshop to actually illustrate how they wanted to see us implement the new changes (another example of how the community already has solutions in mind), and these illustrations were frequently very similar to one another, indicating that a consensus had formed. Already Pro Because Volcano is a professional Counter-Strike player in addition to being a level designer, pro feedback is cooked into Crown very deeply. I believe that Volcano and I make a great team because we know that if the other person raises an issue, that he speaks on behalf of a large segment of the community. I consider priority one of my job asking Volcano about the competitive repercussions of every design decision we initiate: leaving this window open vs. closed, the readability of this area, whether this area needs more cover, and so on. The community was widely requesting a new path cutting from middle to CT courtyard due to lengthy rotation times and Volcano also felt that this was a necessary change to make. My stance was that I was satisfied with how Crown was playing, and that proper team coordination would give CT s enough time to rotate, especially once people were more familiar with the map. Volcano didn t necessarily disagree, but he was pretty certain that the community would be happier if we implemented the change, and that not implementing the change could ultimately limit Crown s variety in competitive play. We had considered such a path early on in Crown s gray-box stage, but decided not to implement the path back then because we wanted to emphasize identifying fakes and making timely call-outs about what the Terrorists were doing. As it happened, the community didn t love the lengthened rotation times, perhaps because rotating places huge emphasis on the teamplay aspect of Counter-Strike, but truly relying on your teammates can be frustrating outside of a tournament-style setting.

Their goal with Crown is simple: build the best competitive Counter-Strike map ever. In part two, Snelling breaks down Crown s level design and the tools used to build map geometry and textures. The first step in making a multiplayer map is creating a layout. But what is a layout? For level designers, a layout is the floor-plan of a level lurking in their brain, which they often draw out as a blueprint and then sculpt into a 3D grey box representation in-game. For everyday players, a layout is how they visualize a level s available paths and make strategic decisions. We spent nine months refining Crown s layout into the final map it is today. And now Crown is ready for the public. It s available today. You can download the map right now &nbsp;on the Steam Workshop and play it in Counter-Strike: GO. Read on to learn how we built it. A top-down view of Crown's layout. The sheer number of revisions Crown has gone through over the course of nine months reveals the enormous challenge of mapping an environment from your imagination. Grey boxing is very much like sprouting a new world out of thin air like a creative big bang and for that reason it is a frustrating, difficult stage of a map s development that many people never get past. Volcano and I spent countless hours pondering layout details both in our grey-boxed version of Crown, and once the map evolved into a more visually detailed environment. I think almost every level designer in the world recognizes that no matter how well thought-out, a level will always go through a maturation process once it becomes a playable space. Thankfully, Crown s earliest stages are well documented, allowing us to show screenshots of Crown in its infancy. Above: an early image of Crown as a grey box. Below: finalized version of the same part of the map. Can you spot the subtle changes in geometry? The right path Our primary goals with Crown s grey boxed layout was to maintain the spacious, open feeling of Dust2, without losing sight of the precise efficiency of Inferno s layout. It's also about the size of Dust2, making it a fairly small map. For this reason, Volcano and I decided to make the map s geometry imposing and impressive. To focus on one area which evolved during our discussions, this path outside of CT spawn, for example, would become the focus of continued revision throughout Crown s development. Another grey box shot of Crown featuring a fountain ""prop."" The fountain is removed as final geometry begins to shape up. To further highlight Crown s evolution, the window pictured in this (near) final image has since been removed. Volcano s goal with this epic walkway was to include elements of verticality similar to a map like Nuke verticality which extends all the way into the B bombsite without creating awkward firefights where players are forced to look straight up at the sky. The path leading up to this vertical terrace was a challenge: although we wanted verticality, one consequence of creating higher ground is that it can make surrounding areas obsolete. Our perch needed to have drawbacks and limitations which would make the lower path viable. Over time, we added a slot above the terrorist entrance leading into this route which would allow an attacking team to coordinate smoke and flash grenades to block visibility along this long sight-line. Much later in the development process, we added a route into the area commonly referred to as armory. We observed players having difficulty retaking the bombsite due to limited entry points and the additional route alleviated the issue and made the armory a crucial area to control in the bombsite. The editor &nbsp; The view from the Valve Hammer Editor Counter-Strike: GO maps are made with Hammer, an aging tool which isn t easy to use. In Hammer, geometry is mostly composed of brushes, a fancy word for cubes, and mapping resembles playing with LEGO. Walls or other flat surfaces can be brushwork. Other intricate elements you might see in a level such as a chair, a light fixture or an ornamental doorway, are props models imported from programs like Maya or 3DSMAX. Here you can see editor screenshots of Crown s brushwork, as well as flat screenshots which place emphasis on Crown s total geometry (brushwork + props). Clockwise: Wireframe view, flat-lighting view, differentiating between props and brushwork, final lighting Source unfortunately hits a brush limit fast. It would be difficult to make 1/4th of Crown with brushes alone; we needed to convert much of the brushwork of the map into models in order for the map to compile. Compiling is a process which converts the map into a file readable by the Source engine. In practice, compiling means sitting around at your computer for an hour and a half while lighting is b...",1395158459,

Here are some of the best moments from the event in Poland, from some of the best players in the world. My favorite video by far is of Janusz sNax Pogorzleski from Virtus.Pro (the team that also won the championship) silently taking down three NiP members. The restraint he demonstrates here, waiting for the perfect moment, is unbelievable: From markeloff vs. Titan, a completely different, chaotic moment. Cornered and almost out of ammo, markeloff pulls through: Four shots with the AWP, four kills. Brutal: More incredible AWP skills: And finally, here s Virtus.Pro winning the championship.

Their goal with Crown is simple: build the best competitive Counter-Strike map ever. In part one, Snelling dives into the inspiration for Crown's design and the essence of a great competitive map. This is Crown: a new map for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive nine months in the making. After over 100 substantial revisions across those nine months, Crown is nearly finished. It was designed with two goals: to make CS:GO s hardcore fans happy while disrupting GO s stagnant competitive map pool. It s inspired by classic maps like Dust2 and Inferno. But it s built to be even better. Just as CS:GO is a new evolution for the Counter-Strike franchise, Crown is a map which seeks to learn from the best and build upon the principles that have kept Dust2 and Inferno in competitive play for more than a decade. Before Crown: rebuilding Cache At heart, a map is an idea. Great maps conjure singular, iconic images in our minds. Dust2: the sandy desert village. Inferno: a labyrinth of grainy alleyways. Nuke: a towering facility. These places do not exist except in-game and in our collective consciousness. Real-world inspiration for de_inferno One map, Cache, only recently entered that collective consciousness. Cache was originally designed by Sal Volcano Garozzo for Counter-Strike: Source in Spring 2010. When CS:GO was released, Cache was ported to the Steam Workshop, where it became a staple of professional competitive leagues. After I created two GO maps of my own, I took a look at Cache and was impressed with what I saw. Maps like Cache have a unity to them a clean, simple flow. I wasn t surprised to learn that Volcano was originally a professional CS player, and a legend in the scene. What was surprising was that Cache was the very first map he ever made. This was someone I had to work with. Before we tackled building a new map, we set about modernizing Cache. Cache has since been featured in two of CS:GO s Operation map-promotions, included in many of the game's most prestigious tournaments, and is played by thousands of players for more than 11,000 hours every day. Even before our work on Cache was complete, though, Volcano and I were imagining that new, original project we had put on hold the map which would become Crown. Dreaming up Crown: level design fundamentals When Volcano and I were brainstorming a new map, we broke down what we liked and didn t like about the existing map pool. I have a confession to make: other than Cache, it's rare to see me playing any map other than Dust2. Just talking about Dust2 transforms into Captain Ahab from Moby Dick: the old sailor who got his leg bitten off by that white whale and forever-afterwards harbored a maniacal, obsessive grudge against it. I want to make a map better than Dust2 almost more than I want to breathe. And then I talked to Volcano, and he actually prefers Inferno! A timeless view of de_dust2's spaciousness Volcano and I have slightly different perspectives. I dig Dust2 because it s easy to play, is spacious, and has a warm-feeling aesthetic. Volcano likes Inferno because its layout is probably the best in the game for competitive play: teams have a large number of different strategic choices, and they never feel predictable. To boil it down, I was thinking sort of abstractly about visceral things how the map would feel to play while Volcano s emphasis was first and foremost on making a layout for competitive play. We both recognized, however, that a great map must have both of those elements. de_inferno's pristine layout Cache also influenced Crown substantially, but not how you might expect. Because Cache places so much emphasis on its middle area, Volcano told me that he wanted to create a map that went in the opposite direction completely: a map without a traditional middle. This made me nervous. When Terrorists plant the bomb in one of two bombsites, any Counter-Terrorists on the other side of the map have to either rotate to that bombsite or flank around and kill any Terrorists in the area, while the bomb is still ticking, before they can try to defuse it. A map without a middle means there is no central path allowing the CTs to get to the ticking bomb more quickly. Cache's infamously dangerous middle Rotating on Crown is a special, stressful challenge. Entire Terrorist teams will have to either barge into one bombsite, or split up to create confusing diversions in both. Counter-Terrorists will need to predict the Terrorists' intent, or rotating will be down-to-the-wire or futile. No other map used in competitive play will place as much emphasis on rotation, and I think the consequence of this will be game-defining sieges or Alamo-style defenses. It s going to be do-or-die from start to finish, and individual players will need to come up big for...",1394211566,

For Operation Phoenix, the maps were chosen by popular vote - and as such, round up some of the best battlegrounds featured in previous operations. Although, if you're anything like me, the quality is less important than the variety. When you're inevitably killed in the first few seconds of the round, it's important to have some nice level design to enjoy through the death camera. The returning eight maps are Cache, Motel, Seaside, Downtown, Thunder, Ali, Favela and Agency. All will be available to play in Casual, Competitive and Deathmatch modes, ensuring a busy few months of battle in the constant war between terrorism and not terrorism. Purchase of the $3 access pack also provides buyers with a Coin, which can be upgraded through playtime and wins. The Phoenix Coin is also a scorecard - giving players a complete run down of their stats across the included maps.

Written by Matt Thrower Fifteen years ago I thought myself the god of Unreal Tournament: an untouchable colossus of speed and firepower tearing through every difficulty level with consummate ease. So naturally, as soon as I got broadband I tried out for a high ranking clan. They wiped the floor with me, blowing my avatar asunder with the same insouciance I had playing against the bots and laughing as they fell before me. It was the beginning of a long and illustrious career of being Very Bad Indeed at online games. Yet here I remain, regularly clocking hours on Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty, and DayZ and regularly left propping up the leaderboards. I m hardly alone. Public servers commonly have their fair share of deadbeats alongside the clan members and twitch kiddies who rule the maps. The gaming demographic increasingly includes middle-aged people with kids and mortgages who want to kick back in the evening and have some fun, but don t have the free time to practice. And, predictably, the more experienced players slaughter them, time and time again. Why do we keep coming back for more pain? Suckers for punishment Lennart Nacke, who researches affective gaming and entertainment computing at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, suggests it might be connected to something he calls the feedback loop of self-regulation. We need four things to regulate our behavior: standards, monitoring, strength and motivation, he tells me. People in online games form their standard by participating in matches and monitoring their own performance. Every time they engage in another match they get feedback on their prior performance and adjust their current efforts. But doesn t that mean that practice would eventually lower their motivation when they reached their desired standard? The randomness of the players and the randomness in the twitch games themselves mean the standard is constantly adjusting, he says. It keeps the players in a monitoring loop of their own behavior and this leads them to come back. StarCraft 2: Making you wish you had extra hands since 2010. This desire to practice and improve is a colossal motivator, an effect more widely known as positive reinforcement. Mia Consalvo, Research Chair in Game Studies at Concordia University, agrees and she has some data to back up her opinion. In my research on why people cheat, I found that most players went to great effort not to cheat they wanted to earn their achievements in games fairly, via their own efforts, she says. This leads me to believe that often, players really want that sense of accomplishment that comes from their own efforts and skills via play. That suggests that such players are earnest in wanting to advance in the game. And here that takes the form of multiple plays, even without success. There s substantial research to back up the hypothesis that, counter-intuitively, failure actually encourages further participation. A 2011 study of internet chess by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Sami Abuhamdeh suggested that players actively chose more capable opponents, and had the most fun against people that they beat only 25 percent of the time, on average. This seemingly contradictory enjoyment of failure has a parallel in philosophy known as the tragedy paradox. Why do people actively enjoy works of art that prompt unpleasant emotions such as sadness and fear? There s no straightforward answer, but we re all familiar with the experience of bellowing the rage and frustration engendered by failure at the screen, and then quite sincerely telling our friends how great the game was. Lennart points out that video games offer a uniquely good environment to explore this effect. They put us in an explicit rule context, where our boundaries are known and we can quickly observe the skills of other players, he tells me. This framing of a game allows us to set clear a goal for our behavior and it is much easier to monitor our progress than in real life, where the rules are not clear and the skills of our opponents would be unknown to us. Raging against the machine Lennart's explanation doesn't entirely explain why gamers like me, who ll simply never have the time or the reflexes to beat the teenage experts that throng the servers, continue to play in the face of repeated maulings. I know I m a hopeless case, so it can t just be the lure of potential improvement that keeps me going. What s particularly interesting is how this attitude contrasts with that engendered by overly difficult solo games. We ve all played games with excessive learning curves and uneven difficulty spikes, and often the response is annoyance and frustration followed by throwing in the towel. It seems to me there must be something qualitatively different in playing against other people, but what? Consalvo thinks that it might just be me. I've known players that have attempted particular moves or levels in single player games up to 100 times, she relates, so we c...",1392836904,

The new documentary follows professional Counter-Strike: GO player Jonatan ""Devilwalk"" Lundberg and his Fnatic team as it attempts to win the Dreamhack Winter 2013 tournament. A support player in the Fnatic Counter-Strike squad, Lundberg likens himself to a psychologist or ""shrink,"" as he puts it, in that a big part of achieving any goal is keeping people together and focused on a single objective. ""We are a team that doesn't really change,"" Lundberg says in the film. ""We've had the same core players since the start of the year and that's really, really unique. People quit, people change lineups because they get in fights, can't resolve their issues. So they just start over, which is the wrong way to go I think."" As well as offering polished insight into some of the personalities behind a top eSports team, director Zacharias Dyrborg's film features some great play-by-play action of competitive Counter-Strike and works to explain the mindset of the Fnatic team before and after each match. For me, it showed that while skill will almost always show itself in highly stressful situations, success can also depend just as much on understanding how to take advantage of the emotional side of competition.",1392497032,
10,How to configure Counter-Strike: GO for the maximum competitive advantage,"<a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/02/04/how-to-configure-counter-strike-go-for-the-maximum-competitive-advantage/"" rel=""bookmark"" title=""Permanent Link to How to configure Counter-Strike: GO for the maximum competitive advantage""> </a> Article by Jonny ""Waffles"" Fuller Counter-Strike: Global Offensive s surge in popularity over the past few months makes now a great time to join one of the most competitive multiplayer shooters on PC. This visual guide will teach you how to set up your game for the maximum competitive advantage. There s no singular best practice, as a lot of configuration is personal preference, but there are tweaks you can make to graphics and network settings, keybindings, and more to help outplay the competition. Understand your graphics settings There s no consensus among the competitive community about which screen resolution is the best. Lots of players look towards the pros using ancient 4:3 resolutions such as 800x600 for guidance. However, there is no singular advantage provided by using 4:3 resolutions. Some hardcore players use these resolutions because they were optimal in the 1.6 era and allowed legacy CRTs to hit higher refresh rates, and pros are generally change-averse. But when you re using a 4:3 resolution, your horizontal field of view is just 74 degrees. Some players prefer this narrow view as it allows them to focus centrally on their target, and positions the radar closer to center. At 16:9 the player has a 90-degree field of view, which allows more vision towards the edges of the screen. I value this peripheral vision over narrow focus, and thus use 1920x1080 (16:9). Ideally, you want to use the native resolution of your monitor while maximizing your framerate. The single best way to increase your FPS is to drop your resolution, so let's dig into CS:GO's graphics settings. Improve FPS with launch options Make all your graphical adjustments with the knowledge that CS:GO is a CPU-limited game in general. There s no holy grail console or config command that can dramatically improve your FPS, but there are some slight tweaks we can make. Drop all your in game graphics settings to low, disable anti-aliasing, enable multi-core rendering Add these launch options to your launch parameters in Steam (see screenshot above): -novid -console -high -threads 4 These commands disable the intro, enable the console, set the process affinity to high, and grant your cores to CS:GO, even though technically Source can only use 3 threads. Some players add the -processheap parameter thinking it will grant better fps, but because this substitutes Windows memory management for Valve s own code it is highly recommend to remove it. The next step involves modifying CS:GO's config file. It's a bit more complicated, but allows us to make some really useful tweaks. Adjust graphics settings in the config file Find your config.cfg in the cfg folder within the game directory (default C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg). If you don't already have file extensions enabled in Windows, you should enable them now to make sure that, when you edit the config file, it retains the .cfg extension. To turn on file extensions, click Organize in Windows Explorer, click Folder and search options, tab over to View, and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types. Now let's edit config.cfg. You can open it in Windows Notepad, but it'll be easier to read with a more advanced text editor, like the free Notepad++. Now, edit these lines in the config file. For most of them, you'll simply be switching out a 0 for a 1, or something similar. r_drawtracers_firstperson Set to ""0"" - Disable first-person tracers. Enemy tracers are still drawn. mat_monitorgamma Set to ""2.1"" - The brighter the better so you can illuminate enemies. mat_queue_mode ""-1"" - Auto-detect multi-core rendering mat_savechanges Add this line to write video settings to the registry. cl_forcepreload 1 - Forces the game to load all the sound and art assets on map load. This can help you if you experience stuttering when certain sounds go off, such as throwing a grenade into a bunch of props cl_disablehtmlmotd 1 - disables those annoying ads when connecting to a server cl_autowepswitch 0 - Disables automatically switching to a primary gun you pick up off the ground so you don t draw an unloaded weapon cl_disablefreezecam 1 - Disables the annoying freeze on death so you can make proper calls to your team mates You can save your changes, but don't close the config file just yet. Next, we're going to tweak the most vital of all CS:GO settings: network settings. Adjust network settings in the config file These network settings are the most important commands you will type into your config file. Find the following commands in your config and change their values as noted: cl_interp ""0"" cl_cmdrate ""128"" cl_updaterate ""128"" Also, add rate to your config file with the following value: rate ""128000"" Think of it like this: there are two versions of Counter-Strike being played, yours and the server s. The client version is (default) 100 milliseconds in the past of the ""real"" (server) version of the game world. The more updates you have, the less interpol...",1391554993,
