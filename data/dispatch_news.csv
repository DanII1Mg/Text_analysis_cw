Cinematic, emotional, and full of heart, it’s the sound of heroes just trying to do better. The story continues next week.If you've been following along, you already know that Dispatch is releasing episodically over the course of 4 weeks. We’ll be dropping two episodes a week for the next three weeks.

2592160,A First Look At Dispatch—Calling All Heroes,"I was actually pretty interested in <em>Dispatch</em> when it was first revealed during The Game Awards 2024. I feel like there’s been a fair bit of time between <a href=""https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/the-walking-dead-the-final-season-episode-one-done-running-review/"">the exhausting release</a> of episodic games and the genre’s…let’s say <em>hibernation</em> that the prospect of a new one was actually exciting again. Not only that, but rather than being based on an existing property, this game was going to be its own unique story and ideas, which only sweetened the pot. CGM got a chance to sit down with <a href=""https://x.com/theAdHocStudio"">AdHoc Studio</a> to get a first look at <em>Dispatch,</em> and it made a pretty impressive first impression. Not only does it look to tell a compelling and engaging story, rounded out by a cast of complex and interesting characters, but it’s got a lot more depth to its gameplay than the average point-and-click inspired narrative game. COO & Dispatch Creative Director Nick Herman introduced us to the company in about as blunt a way as possible, saying, “We were founded in 2018 by two writers and two... <a href=""https://www.cgmagonline.com/articles/previews/first-look-at-dispatch/"">Read more</a> ",1758092400,

2592160,Dispatch Demo Released!,"We’re thrilled to announce the first-ever playable demo of Dispatch during Steam Next Fest! To kick off the release, we've cut together a quick trailer that premiered at the PC Gaming Show to help spread the word. Play the DemoIn this demo, you’ll dive into Robert’s first day as an SDN Dispatcher, meeting new co-workers and encountering the infamous Z-Team—ex-supervillains enrolled in the Phoenix Program, an initiative aimed at rehabilitating them (or at least trying to).About DispatchDispatch, AdHoc Studio’s debut game, is a superhero workplace comedy where choices matter, set against the backdrop of modern-day Los Angeles.You’ll step into the shoes of Robert Robertson—better known as Mecha Man—who finds himself without his signature suit after losing a battle with his nemesis. With no choice but to rebuild, Robert takes on a new role at SDN, a hero-for-hire agency, trading combat for a desk job dispatching superheroes. About AdHoc StudioWe are a small independent game studio loosely based in Los Angeles, CA, but have people on our team from all over the states, Canada, Brazil, and other parts of the world. Our studio was founded by folks who previously worked at Telltale Games, Ubisoft, and Night School Studio, writing and directing on critically acclaimed titles like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Tales from the Borderlands. Much like those games, Dispatch puts interactive narrative at the heart of the experience.What's NextDispatch is coming out this year, so the whole team is heads down finishing it! There's only 6 months left inside 2025, so yeah, we're equally freaked out and committed to getting it done on time. Also, it's worth calling out that while the demo does not have full controller or Steam Deck support at this time, we plan to include those features in the full release later this year. Additionally, we’re working on localization across multiple languages—stay tuned for updates on player interface options, subtitles, and supported features coming at launch. Join Other DispatchersWe're incredibly fortunate to have such a welcoming and engaged community of Dispatchers on our Discord! If you’d like to connect with fellow players while waiting for launch, join the official AdHoc Studio server—where our development team actively chats with the community and shares exclusive updates.Happy Dispatching!
