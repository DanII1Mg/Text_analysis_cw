532210,How Life is Strange 2 challenged video game representations of homelessness,"Homelessness is a constant and tragic backdrop to urban life. Walk through any major city and you'll find rough sleepers asking for change, tents pitched under overpasses, and charities trying to provide aid. Despite all these signs, and the rise in homelessness over the last decade, this tragedy is often ignored and overlooked on both a government and individual level, culminating in businesses even incorporating anti-homeless architecture into their designs, and laws that force rough sleepers out of certain areas. A lot of games feature homelessness too, but these NPCs often suffer the same sympathetic dismissal as those on the streets. Several games trying to underpin the unpleasantness, hopelessness, or ruthlessness of their world sprinkle homelessness throughout their cities. But without any meaningful consideration, they are rarely any more than set decoration. In 2016, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided let players explore a dystopian Prague filled with homeless beggars, there to emphasise the state of the world and its view of Augs. Like other NPCs wandering around Prague, some dispense tiny bits of dialogue if you try and interact with them, but others exist only to highlight the political climate. Players can't offer them change or even reply to them, they are nothing but a feature of the landscape, like the inanimate billboards that also tell the city's darker story. All the way back in 2010, the first game in the Metro series had homeless metro dwellers living alongside the apparently non-homeless residents of the metro. Although everyone was displaced by the nuclear holocaust above, there are still the haves and the have-nots in this world, with some seemingly extra homeless compared to others. At least these games allow you to give them a bullet or two. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-18-how-life-is-strange-2-challenged-video-game-representations-of-homelessness"">Read more</a> ",1579334400,

532210,Life is Strange 2 review,"During the third episode of Life is Strange 2, main character Sean Diaz is presented with a choice that could help bring his ordeal to an early end, but would put his little brother Daniel in danger. Being the responsible father figure that I clearly am, I decline the opportunity. But then later on in the episode, I&#x2019;m asked to make that same choice again. And again. In the end, the decision is made for me, and everything falls to pieces. Life is Strange 2 begins in suburban Seattle, where a fatal misunderstanding forces Sean and Daniel to flee their home. In his panic, Sean takes his brother on the run, aiming for his father&#x2019;s family home in Puerto Lobos, Mexico, and the pair take the first steps on their year-long journey to the border. His decision provides an impressive backdrop to their adventure&#x2014;chilling Oregon winters, towering Californian forests, and sweltering Arizona deserts offer an ambitious alternative to the series&#x2019; traditionally small-town narratives&#x2014;but also forces Life is Strange 2 to immediately undermine its road-tripping raison d&#x2019;etre. Rather than directly portray a 1,500 mile journey, developer Dontnod sticks to its series&#x2019; classic tropes. Exploration, dialogue, and character development are its strengths, but those are difficult to achieve within the confines of a Greyhound bus. Instead, the story moves from vignette to vignette, with each chapter set months after the one before, in a place where Sean and Daniel can stay in relative safety for a few days or weeks. Here lies the game&#x2019;s most existential dilemma. These havens provide a place to live&#x2014;at least temporarily&#x2014;almost entirely off-grid, a rare opportunity to lay low and take stock. In one episode, whole chunks of dialogue are given over to the idea of holding out for next month&#x2019;s paycheck, while another places the brothers firmly within the nuclear family they both so clearly crave. Those themes, of financial security and familial responsibility, are woven throughout the game, but their importance pales in comparison to Dontnod&#x2019;s desire for a classic roadtrip, and so Sean and Daniel are moved on, irrespective of the decisions made within the episode. The story moves from vignette to vignette, with each chapter set months after the one before. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Life is Strange 2&#x2019;s most powerful tool is not directly in your hands. While players control Sean, it&#x2019;s Daniel who boasts supernatural abilities. Sean quickly adopts the role of mentor, but his younger brother is a precocious child, and while he might start by using his powers for something as innocuous as cheating at dice, it&#x2019;s not long before he begins to understand the extent of his abilities. Eventually, the player isn&#x2019;t just battling with the game&#x2019;s desire to get you to Mexico no matter the narrative implications, but against a central game mechanic that happens to have developed a personality. It&#x2019;s a fascinating concept, rarely explored outside the idea of rogue AI, but in a series that supposedly holds player choice in such high regard, it&#x2019;s deeply misplaced. Until next time The first episode of Life is Strange 2 released in September 2018, meaning the journey from debut to finale took more than 14 months. Nearly four months passed between episodes one and two alone, and while the release cadence sped up as the series reached its finale, the damage had already been done. The time between episodes seems to have been an attempt to mirror the length of Sean and Daniel&#x2019;s journey, but to do so at the expense of narrative pacing and character development feels misjudged. So much of what the brothers&#x2019; story happened off-screen&#x2014;entire characters and story arcs were relegated to pages in Sean&#x2019;s diary&#x2014;that meant it was difficult to stay engaged between chapters. In a post-Telltale industry, Life is Strange&#x2019;s structure already feels like an eccentricity. It speaks volumes that when Dontnod announced its next game&#x2014;episodic narrative adventure Tell Me Why&#x2014;shortly before the release of episode five, it was made clear that the entire story will release over the course of a few months next summer. There are some excellent moments dotted throughout the game, and it&#x2019;s clear that Dontnod has something to say about American race relations. Often, it leans too heavily on patriotic stereotypes to do so, but the final episode in particular focuses carefully on the concept of Sean&#x2019;s reverse American Dream. Overall though, Life is Strange 2 is more interested in that dream than in its own central themes&#x2014;those of brotherhood, family, and the passing down of knowledge and responsibility to the next generations. Its desire to stick to the series&#x2019; established tropes means you&#x2019;re forced into set-piece after set-piece on your inevitable road to Mexico,...",1575981783,
532210,"Life is Strange 2 review - a bolder, more mature sequel that's a different kind of animal","When Life is Strange 2's first episode launched, its differences seemed to define it. It was a road trip game, where the first Life is Strange had been so focused on a particular place. It featured a far smaller recurring cast, without the familiar faces who had helped flesh out Arcadia Bay. And it was about two brothers, their relationship defined by a difference in age as well as special abilities. It felt a lonelier experience, one slightly harder to warm to, with a central relationship which at times felt more like work than friendship. Ultimately, each of these differences has helped Life is Strange 2 stand out as something unique, truthful and necessary. Sean Diaz and his younger brother Daniel are forced to run from home and evade the law following the events of a tragedy which leaves them alone in the world. We meet them in a brief moment of normality - part of a family and set of friends not dissimilar from those seen in the first Life is Strange. And then everything falls to pieces. The brotherly bond the game then explores is a slower burn compared to the rekindling of a reconnection among old friends or the spark of a romance seen in previous seasons. Instead, Life is Strange 2's heart lies in the growing understanding between these two boys of what they mean to each other, out on the road. It is a closeness learnt over long days trekking through the forest and longer nights spent shivering together by a campfire. It is the continued hardships faced along their journey, the bigotry they endure due to racial profiling, the new friends which help them further towards their goal. It is Daniel's special powers as a metaphor for a volatile child dealing with loss. And, most of all, it is the ways you as the teenage Sean respond to all of these things - which in turn moulds how the younger Daniel reacts too. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-12-06-life-is-strange-2-review-a-bolder-more-mature-sequel-thats-a-different-kind-of-animal"">Read more</a> ",1575651000,
532210,Which Life is Strange 2 ending did you get?,"What are all the different Life is Strange 2 endings? Choice has always been important to Dontnod&apos;s adventure series, but in Life is Strange 2, your decisions are felt more powerfully than ever. Sean and Daniel&apos;s epic journey across America may now be over, but the decisions you made across the game&#x2019;s five chapters have shaped the pair&apos;s destination more than you might think. Warning: Naturally, this article contains <strong>major story spoilers</strong> for Life is Strange 2. I recommend you experience the story yourself, as it was intended, before you dig into spoiler territory below. So, here are all the Life is Strange 2 episode 5 endings and how you get them. How many Life is Strange 2 endings are there? The first game ended in two main ways, but there are a whopping <strong>seven different Life is Strange 2 endings</strong>. If you&#x2019;ve already finished your adventure and curious about how they all diverge, check out each one in the video further down this guide. How does the endings system work, anyway? Before I get to how each ending works, there are a few important things to note. At the very end of the game, Sean and Daniel are facing off against a police blockade at the USA/Mexico border. Here, Sean is presented with a choice: he can surrender and turn himself in, or use Daniel&#x2019;s powers and escape. The thing is, Daniel has a mind of his own. Throughout the game, the example Sean sets for him determines his &#x2018;Morality&#x2019;. If one large wolf appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen, the decision affects Sean, but if only a small wolf appears, it affects Daniel. If two wolves appear, both brothers are affected. If you taught Daniel right from wrong&#x2014;discouraging him from using his powers violently, for example&#x2014;he will have high Morality. However, if Daniel sees this kind of behaviour from Sean, he learns from it, and is more likely to have low Morality by the end of the game. Your actions will have affected Daniel&#x2019;s actions in previous episodes, but the final Morality score has the biggest impact on your ending.&#xA0; Some stem from the same set of results during the showdown at the border, but are shaped by decisions in earlier episodes. Sean&#x2019;s friendship with Lyla or his romance with Finn or Cassidy in episode 3 can add some minor changes to the game&#x2019;s final cutscenes. All Life is Strange 2 endings <strong>Redemption</strong> If Sean decides to surrender at the border while Daniel has high Morality, he tells Daniel that the story of the wolf brothers ends now, and the two embrace. Sean is arrested by Agent Flores, who says Daniel will be looked after&#x2014;he then moves in with his grandparents in Beaver Creek. 15 years later, Daniel and Karen meet Sean as he leaves prison. That night, the pair camp out in the woods together before parting ways again the next morning. If Sean chooses to call Lyla at the end of episode 1, she accompanies Daniel and Karen in this ending cutscene, and the pair will embrace. <strong>Lone Wolf</strong> If you surrender but Daniel has a low Morality, Sean throws away his car keys, but Daniel will refuse to accept your decision. Using his powers, he moves the car forward and past the border, before noticing that Sean has been shot and killed by police.&#xA0; Many years later, Daniel has made it to Puerto Lobos, where he has built a small memorial to Sean. When he&apos;s attacked on the beach, he uses his powers to defend himself, but ultimately spares the lives of the gang members who approach him. Unsurprisingly, this is considered Life is Strange 2&#x2019;s &#x2018;bad&#x2019; ending. <strong>Parting Ways</strong> If you used Daniel&#x2019;s powers to escape to Mexico, but he has high Morality, Sean begins driving forward and asks his brother to move the police cars in front of him. Daniel initially refuses, but eventually relents and opens the gate to allow the car through. At the last moment, Daniel leaps from the car, allowing Sean to make his escape. Daniel moves into his grandparents&#x2019; house, occasionally using his powers, but appears to be under some kind of house arrest. Here he remains in contact with both Sean and Karen, receiving a collection of photos during the final cutscene. Depending on decisions made in previous episodes, this ending has a few variations. If you romance Cassidy by listening to her song in episode 2, drink with her, join her for a midnight swim, kiss, refuse the heist, and enter her tent, she appears in a photo next to Sean.&#xA0; You can also romance Finn by having Sean say he is attracted to some boys, agreeing to the heist, kissing him, and then saving his life in episode 3. In episode 4, Sean can visit Finn&#x2019;s hospital room and forgive him for the heist to successfully romance him, after which he appears in the photo, instead of Cassidy. If Sean romances neither Finn or Cassidy but still gets this ending, he appears in the photo alone. <strong>Blood Brothers</strong> If Daniel has low Morality when Sean asks him to cross the border, Dan...",1575635276,

After the first Life is Strange, when the three of us (Michel Koch, Raoul Barbet, and Jean-Luc Cano) first met to write this new story and these new characters, we never imagined how much impact Sean and Daniel would have on us, and how many incredible moments we would share along the way. We have shared heartfelt moments in the process of creating the game, and in some poignant scenes within its episodes. We have also shared them with the community, and all the amazing people we have met – and of course with the whole team, who have worked so passionately and so hard all these years. It has been a long and difficult production since we began with The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, and we are now proud to complete this journey together: both the team behind Life is Strange 2 and you, the players from all over the world. We all now find ourselves before this final choice in Episode 5, in the middle of the desert... We hope this story will speak to you, make you want to travel, and want to share it. Enjoy the game!

The end of the road. When you go on a trip, you often think first about the destination, where you want to go. It's been four years – our first-ever brainstorm on Life is Strange 2 was on December 1, 2015 – since we started to walk the roads alongside Sean and Daniel. Four years during which we had a lot of good times, but also weathered a lot of storms. To question oneself, to propose new things, to explore new themes; all of this is not easy. But in our toughest moments, there's something we've always been able to count on: you. Your feedback, your messages, your encouragement – your criticism, too – they have carried us throughout this adventure. In joy and doubt, in victory and in our search for answers, we were never alone. On all these roads, you were with us. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Today, the journey is coming to an end. For us, as was the case for Max and Chloe, the story of Sean and Daniel is over, and we now have to let them go. It's up to them to fly on their own, to take their independence. It is therefore with great pride, but also a little sadness and nostalgia, that we wish good luck to our Wolf Brothers. Their story is told. They are yours now, they belong to you. Vaya con Dios, Wolf Brothers! The important thing is not the destination, but the journey...

Each time, the team goes through periods of intense creativity that escalate to panic mode (as the days to release fly by). The excitement builds every day, until the moment the episode is finally out. Each time we release, we watch the streams, the reactions, read the comments, EVERYTHING… This time it’s special. As Jean-Luc says, this is finally the end of the road. Just like Sean and Daniel on their journey, we have shared great moments and difficult times. We all held together in front of the elements, never slowed our momentum or our onward march, and met awesome people all along the road. This is the time for the Life is Strange team at DONTNOD to thank everyone that helped us create this project, the players that gave the chance to the game and supported us from the start, and the ones who will soon discover the wolf brothers’ story. We will never forget our journey, and we hope yours will be as memorable.

532210,‘Designing the Cast and World of LiS2′ with Rachele Doimo,"At its core, Life is Strange 2 is a road trip game. Sean and Daniel’s journey from their home in Seattle takes them all across the western states of America: from the snow-covered gardens of wintery Beaver Creek, to the drifter camp under the giant redwoods in California, to the arid Nevada desert. Each environment adds something to the story and they are carefully crafted to feel unique but real: places you could almost go and visit in real life. But locations only come to life when you put people in them. The biggest part of world building isn’t just where does this prop go, but asking yourself: why is it there? Who are the people that live there and what effect do they have on the environment, and the environment on them? Creating a world that feels lived in and is a place that makes sense narratively requires both careful environmental and character design. To explore the creation of the memorable locations of LiS2, and the diverse cast of characters who live in them, we’ve sat down with Square Enix Art Director Rachele Doimo to discuss how the incredible art teams we work with at studios like DONTNOD bring everything to life Let’s start with Environments first. And remember, as with our previous blogs: beware spoilers! Can you tell us what research went into some of the environments covered in Life is Strange 2? Everything started with a trip that the game directors did a few years ago across the USA. It was a journey through a continent that made quite a mark in their life and work. All the memorable places they visited and people they met have contributed to their vision of Life is Strange 2. What were some technical challenges for the larger scope of Life is Strange 2? Performance had to be monitored constantly from asset creation to final lighting pass on each shot. A high number of lights can significantly slow down performance, but at the same time, they can make a huge difference in the quality of each single shot so all assets in a scene, from character models, to props, to lights, to total number of polygons, have to be managed in order not to reduce the framerate. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33068697/0060e974e89f039c2260a2f84f83cd741c6bb7fd.jpg Given the changing environments in each Episode of the game, were there any environmental assets you were able to re-use, or was it a case of starting with a fresh palette of trees, rocks, and ground textures every time? Each location had to be bespoke. Only a small amount of props could be reused, which also impacted development time. Generic grass, for example, is used in multiple locations, but trees and specific flora needed to be consistent with the part of the country that each episode is set. Every asset and material contributes and builds towards the unique, captivating look of an environment in Life is Strange. Into the woods in Episode 1 is the biggest environment to date. Do we see something similar in Ep4? At the beginning of Episode 4, when Sean is heading to Heaven Point, the Nevada desert area is probably the largest location in the game, in terms of visible distance. Although not the highest in asset density, it hopefully successfully creates a sense of loneliness and highlights Sean’s separation from his brother: walking on a vast unknown road through an unfriendly territory. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33068697/e22982331249916866052812eb028391751c16c1.jpg With Life is Strange 1 we had a broad cast of characters but one that remained in a single location: Arcadia Bay. The town had a set number of inhabitants and wasn’t changing in the same way the environments do in LiS2. Though new characters were intermittently introduced, the cast broadly focused on a specific set of people. In Life is Strange 2, the boys are on the road, passing through all manner of towns and communities on their journey south, which, out of necessity, required a much larger supporting cast – from the handful of major characters Sean and Daniel each Episode, to the innumerable secondary and background characters needed to populate each stop on their journey. More characters were designed during the Episode 1 and 2 concept art stage than were designed for the whole of LiS 1. Rachele, with that in mind, we’d like to talk about how the art team develops characters that fascinate us, whether they feature in an episode, a scene, or are just seen in the background. What’s the process of designing a cast of memorable secondary and tertiary characters? The art process starts when an approved character biography is provided by the design team. This is the foundation of what the character should actually look like, the details of which all have to speak about who this person is and what they went through in life before the player encounters them. Facial features and body shape are extremely important, but clothes and accessories play a crucial role too. Even small details like a pin on a jacket can add a lot to the character’s “visual story”. Designing a character is a rather long process th...",1574274825,

532210,Expanding the Life is Strange universe – the franchises first side-quel,"As we move past Episode 1 on the road to #JourneysEnd, we approach a first for the Life is Strange franchise. With The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, there was an opportunity to create an experience not only additive to Life is Strange 2 (and more specifically Episode 2), but to expand the universe by focusing on one side character in-depth – transforming a secondary character into the hero of their very own game. Whilst a rich and touching experience in its own right, Chris appears in Life is Strange 2 Episode 2 to Sean and Daniel for the first time, but as a fully-fledged character to the player. We spoke to Co-Creative Director Raoul Barbet and Square Enix Senior Game Designer Alejandro Gallardo about Captain Spirit, it’s connection to Episode 2, and what the experience meant to them. What excited you about getting the opportunity to deepen a connection to a side character by giving them their own chapter? Raoul: We had been wanting to create a smaller project which would allow us to further develop a character since the very beginning. We chose Chris because his story made for an interesting mirror to that of Sean and Daniel. Chris is roughly Daniel’s age, so we also talk about education and family through his relationship with his father. Of course, it was a first introduction of these themes before diving into them in LiS2 with Sean and Daniel. It made for an interesting parallel and it also allowed us to develop themes we had been wanting to expand upon for a long time, namely childhood, loneliness and the imaginary worlds we create as children. Was it always the plan to use Captain Spirit for a standalone slice of story or were other characters considered? Alejandro: When we started talking about the standalone, there were other characters that we thought it would have been cool to explore, like the drifters. But the one that resonated the most with everyone was Chris’s story. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33068697/fd37cffb8286ab91eadedb189b1bc9536a9400a2.jpg Chris doesn’t have a power, but his wild imagination allows for many more abstract and imaginary scenes than we’re used to seeing in Life is Strange games. Can you tell us about your favourite manifestation? Raoul: Indeed, there isn’t really a power per se in Captain Spirit, but we see Chris’s imagination as a power of sorts. If memory serves, the first manifestation I wanted to see was the one in the long dark corridor Chris must walk through to turn on the water heater. The idea was to make this corridor longer because it embodies a childhood fear, and in our imagination, the corridor appears longer than it really is because we’re scared. It turned into the evil water heater that you need to turn back on, which became a scene in itself, and the basis from which we created all the other imaginary scenes. I would say the water heater is my favourite because I love the monster we created, and because it’s what started everything else. My second favourite is the planet, as I think it’s amazing visually and it adds a very cool element of science-fiction. Alejandro: My favourite manifestation was the Water Eater monster, because it reminded me of my childhood. Kid me and my brother always had a room in the house that was dark and we always imagined monsters living in there, so the fact that Chris needs his alter ego to go in there to beat the monster was very relatable. How do you think the player’s time with Chris in Captain Spirit enhances their view of the character in Life is Strange 2 Episode 2? Alejandro: By experiencing the world through Chris’s eyes, it allows everyone to connect with his story as soon as you see him in Episode 2, making the decisions from Sean’s perspective even more difficult, because you care from Chris and you want the best for him. Hopefully you care even more about the bond that Daniel creates with Chris, because for the first time you have seen Daniel happy with a friend – and you know that both kids need each other. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33068697/d98c1af296cdea49828815e591190d2d3b2d0ed1.png Life is Strange is known for tackling difficult realities of life, and in this chapter we were exposed to a young boy living in a home struggling with loss. Whilst Chris takes solace in his imagination, his father suffers from alcoholism. Why is it important for games to explore these elements of life? Raoul: We try to talk about the realities of our society, and we wanted to tackle these themes – communication issues between father and son, loss, grief, and first and foremost, how children often find an escape from grown-up issues through their imagination. We think video games are an ideal medium to tackle these issues because they involve the player, and by playing Chris, we get back into the spirit of being a kid, home alone. As we’re playing a game, it creates a particularly interesting parallel, it’s quite meta: we’re playing a game in which Chris is trying to play to stave off boredom and maybe also to take his mind off of his is...",1573665450,
532210,The Music of LiS2 with Raoul Barbet,"The Life is Strange series has always been synonymous with amazing music. While known for picking standout tracks from lesser-known artists and introducing them to players through memorable scenes, the series has also been gifted with nuanced, emotive scores. For Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2, Co-Creative Director and Music Supervisor Raoul Barbet worked closely with musician Jonathan Morali, known best for his work with indie rock and folk band Syd Matters. With Life is Strange 2, their now-seven-year collaborative relationship allowed them to develop a richer and more varied score, made possible because of the trust and familiarity created between composer and director. Morali’s new score goes on a musical journey with Sean and Daniel, evolving alongside the story and the characters to which it introduces you. Today we wanted to share with you some insights into the score, and how it came to be, by sitting down with Raoul – Beware of spoilers ahead! What emotions did you want to evoke when briefing Jonathan Morali? Raoul Barbet: When I got in touch with him to ask him to work on the first Life is Strange score, I had already been a fan of his and Syd Matters’ work for a long time. Having chosen a few tracks he had composed, I wanted him to retain a similar style, to do something “Syd Matters”. Life is Strange 2, we wanted to do something quite different. The idea was to have a rather stress-free intro that evoked the first Life is Strange, with a lot of acoustic guitar and this ‘cocoon’-like quality we knew from the first game - that tone runs through the whole Seattle section. As soon as the boys started hitting the road, we wanted to change the tone of the score, so we asked him to go with something a little different, with more electronic sounds. Colder, darker things, depending on the scenes, as we knew the brothers were going to face a number of difficulties on the road. We talked about wanting to convey a general feeling for each scene. The themes we asked him to compose were either linked to a given scene and setting, or to a specific character. It’s all about that character’s past, the feeling we want to evoke upon meeting them, and what story we can tell through the instruments, melody, and music for each character and each setting. In the video above, feel how the scene is elevated when the score is added. It sets a severe, sobering tone as the boys lives are changed forever. You had the full shape of the season mapped out before work began on the score, so were there any moments or characters you were especially looking forward to hearing with Jonathan’s music? We had quite a lot of reference material for Jonathan to listen to when we started working on the game, in terms of mood and different musical styles. In Life is Strange 2, I wanted the combination of electronic music with other instruments. We began researching what it would mean to have the brothers on the road. We knew the theme that we called ‘Into the woods” corresponded to specific moments of their journey. We started working on this very early on, especially for Episode 1. We have specific themes for important characters after that. The drifters, for instance, in the camp in Episode 3 , have a score that is tailored to their community, with certain musical layers specific to each character. In Episode 2, we have a dedicated, warmer theme for the grandparents. We tried to create a sort of family feel, to mirror what we experience with them in Episode 2. These are themes specifically linked to scenes or characters. We discussed this a lot for each episode and we tried to establish what important themes we needed for specific characters or scenes - Jonathan and I exchanged a lot of references and ideas for each character. I’m also thinking of Karen, who has a very strong personality, and whose themes played for the first time when we see her in Episode 4, and which you will hear again in Episode 5. It’s a theme tailored to her, and there are a number of layers of the composition that play dynamically, depending on how well we know her and what we choose to do and talk about with her. For instance, as we start talking with her at the motel, we’ll add layers to the track – giving depth to the theme. How has your relationship evolved with Jonathan Morali since you worked with him on the first Life is Strange? Our relationship has evolved a lot, since we’ve been working together for seven years or so. We’ve become more efficient, as we now know each other better. Life is Strange 2 has been a huge challenge because we tried to make its score a lot richer than that of the first game, and it has some rather complicated themes. Being a road trip, there are many different tracks to compose – but I would say that our relationship has grown easier because there is more trust between the audio team, Jonathan and myself. We let him suggest more ideas than before. We did that all along, but now that we trust each other more, we let him sug...",1573233140,

532210,Daniel's Education Explained - Life is Strange 2,"As we approach the #JourneysEnd, we wanted to take some time to deep dive on one of Life is Strange 2’s most important, but also most misinterpreted systems. We hope that this added insight will help guide you in your decision making as you start Life is Strange 2 either for the first time or on a repeat playthrough. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/1012195/4033e01f9cb08b288faeb0ffc6a33b3148ec48e5.jpg As you may know, choices and their consequences in Life is Strange 2 are centered around your brother: Daniel. What we purposefully haven’t outlined properly to date is the depth of this system or how it actually functions as we believe a Life is Strange is best experienced purely rather than trying to game the system underlying it. Quite often we will see players deconstruct the outcome of a Life is Strange 2 episode using the choice and consequence system of previous games: “If you choose these specific three or four options you should get outcome X”. Today we wanted to take some time to explain that interpreting Life is Strange 2 solely through that kind of system can only lead to confusion. Before we get into the new system underlying Life is Strange 2 though, know that each entry in the season does have episode-specific consequence systems that conform to the more traditional choice and consequence approach. Your relationships with secondary characters, for example, are often based on the branching that you’ve come to expect from a Life is Strange game. If you work hard to build a specific relationship, that character’s attitude towards you may change significantly which in turn will open or close off options that determine the fate of these characters. With respect to Daniel however, the system has added layers of complexity. From what we’ve seen so far, Daniel’s education is believed to rely on a “one-track” model similar to the one described above. That is to say that you can, for example, only teach Daniel to either be “Good” or “Bad” and that only certain key decisions will affect his education by nudging him towards becoming either a good or an evil person. The truth, however, is that Daniel grows and learns from your example based on two separate values: Morality and Brotherhood. • Daniel’s Morality state determines how he acts in any given situation. Does he act in a kind and considerate way, or is he entirely selfish, without regard for other people’s feelings or safety? • Daniel’s Brotherhood state determines how he responds to what you, as Sean, teach and ask of him. Does he trust you to make the right choice for the two of you, or will he disregard what you say because you’ve been unable to win his trust? https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/1012195/0ec841ec314d6a11864c2dfdce11e29ae376418f.jpg Here’s the thing: the choices you must make in Life is Strange 2 are, like in other Life is Strange games and life in general, imperfect options. There is no true “right” or “wrong” decision, and all of them are laced with their own pros and cons that could contain a sting in the tail. While some decisions may improve Daniel’s Morality, those same choices can have a negative impact on his trust in you, and vice versa. There are some choices that may add to both Morality and Brotherhood, just like there are others that may reduce them both, or only impact one while leaving the other unaffected. You will have to weigh up each option for yourself and decide which outcome will be better for your personal Diaz brothers. It’s also key to note that opposing choices aren’t just mirrors of one another. That is to say, choosing option A, which may award an increase in Morality, doesn’t mean that option B will reduce Morality by the same amount. Each choice is weighted individually and entirely on its context. Choosing the opposite of a choice that would have affected Daniel’s Brotherhood and trust may not impact his Brotherhood either negatively or positively. In the diagram below we’ve outlined a small number of hypothetical examples of how this concept functions – please note that the diagram and the choice examples are purely for illustrative purposes and are not present in Life is Strange 2. The diagram is also greatly simplified as it has been trimmed down to just 5 examples rather than the multitude of choices that play into determining the consequences you will experience. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/1012195/db4d61e5dbe0d9757946e0674729a3101c01c9a8.jpg Choice 1: Sean reminds Daniel that stealing is wrong, in every situation, and refuses to take money from an unattended wallet. Choice 2: Sean ‘borrows’ a can of cola from a store, to quench Daniel’s thirst, and promises he’ll send the store a couple of dollars in the mail when they get some money. Choice 3: Sean stays up late entertaining Daniel with bedtime stories, with wholesome morals, staving off his nightmares and helping him sleep through the night. C...",1572973749,

And to address the Mantroid in the room – the different release dates. It’s nothing personal, we love you all equally. Different countries have different requirements when it comes to rating the content on the discs, and in some cases, this means that a game (or Episode) can’t be rated until it’s complete and submitted, even if it’s not on the disc, which is why the game will be releasing later in the Americas. With Life is Strange 2 we understand that some players may have been waiting for the final episode to release before diving into the game, and that in an ideal world, those holding out for the physical release wouldn’t want to wait longer than those playing digitally. We wanted to give as many people as possible the opportunity to choose between a digital and physical box full season release on December 3rd, but for the reasons touched on above, we aren’t able to provide a simultaneous release in every territory. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/1012195/084bdb3834b57c81484e7f119b926816a9455cc5.jpg The only alternative was to push every release date back to February 4th, 2020. As Life is Strange fans, you’ll know that struggling with hard choices is at the core of what we do – this was one we agonised over! In the end, we decided a split release was the best way to give the most players the widest amount of choice. For those of you in the Americas who are already playing digitally, or who have been waiting for the game’s full release on digital platforms before diving in, have no fear: the upcoming Season Finale will launch digitally everywhere on December 3rd. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/1012195/640c3466875e477a1b4a40736179e9f2a55eeb6a.jpg Life is Strange 2 is available to buy digitally on Steam.

As you&apos;ve probably guessed, this move has been prompted by the Australian Classification Board: it&apos;s currently reviewing the game&apos;s age ratings.

At the time of writing it&apos;s still available on Steam, and that&apos;s likely to last until Wednesday Australia time.

Recent examples of DLC triggering a ACB reappraisal include Kingdom Come: Deliverance and We Happy Few, which are both now available to purchase after a temporary delisting on digital storefronts.

532210,"Life is Strange 2 makes you feel like a terrible parent, but that's the point","<em>This interview discusses some major story spoilers.</em> Daniel is growing up faster than any child should. We&apos;ve been living off the grid in the vast Humboldt County forest for the last month, working as trimmers on an illegal marijuana farm. The tent we stole from the convenience store back in Washington is now well-worn, just like our clothes. I wake up, disheveled, and walk across our small commune to find Finn encouraging Daniel to throw a knife into a target painted on a tree. I&apos;m not exactly thrilled about this. Finn gives me bad vibes, and I don&apos;t want Daniel hanging around him. With each episode of Life is Strange 2, being a parent to your younger brother becomes more complicated. &quot;Should I feel like I&apos;m screwing this kid up?&quot; I asked lead writer Jean-Luc Cano during our interview. He told me yes, I should feel that way. That&apos;s the point of Life is Strange 2; parenting is complicated enough when there&apos;s a generation gap, but putting aside your own teenage ambitions to be a dad to your younger brother while on the run from law enforcement? I don&apos;t think that&apos;s covered in any parenting book. In the first Life is Strange, you&apos;re responsible for yourself. As Max, some of your decisions affect others, like Chole, but it directly influences the trajectory of your story. In Life is Strange 2, all your decisions are focused on Daniel. Everything you decide has positive or negative consequences for him. Teaching him one thing early on in the game may result in a completely opposite outcome than what you intended. Cano and the rest of the team wanted to create a greater emotional impact on the player by having their choices affect someone else&apos;s life. Even the smallest of choices can have varying effects on Daniel.&#xA0; This made the writing process itself more difficult compared to the first game. &quot;With Max, you can see the consequences of your actions really fast,&quot; said Cano. &quot;In Life is Strange 2, it&apos;s not really visible from the beginning, but it will still shape the behavior of Daniel, and his behavior will change a lot from episode one to five.&quot; It not just one of your decisions that will ultimately shape Daniel into the person he becomes by the end of the game. Sometimes you <em>think</em> you&apos;ve made a good parenting decision, but you can&apos;t control the choices of others, like Finn&#x2014;and when a kid idolizes another adult-figure instead of you, you can automatically become the bad guy. It&apos;s these difficult, morality-steeped choices that Cano wanted to put into the theme of the Life is Strange 2: Education. &quot;Daniel wants to make his own decisions and sometimes Sean doesn&apos;t want him to do it, but Daniel wants to do it anyways. There&apos;s a lot of tension and a lot of friction between Sean and Daniel, and we wanted the last scene of episode three to encompass all of these things.&quot;&#xA0; That&apos;s why episode three ends with a shard of glass in Sean&apos;s eye and with Daniel missing. Feeling helpless and out of control of the situation is probably one of the worst places for a parent to be. I&apos;m not a parent in real life, but the game definitely made me feel that way. But Cano&apos;s personal experience as a parent not only influenced some of the story in Life is Strange 2, but also the first game. &quot;Life is Strange is a coming-of-age tale, and I wrote it when I became a father. And maybe that&apos;s why I wrote Life is Strange 2, to come up with this idea of my daughter as she grows up.&quot; Every decision he makes, every word he says, his daughter will look to him as an example. It&apos;s a part of her education, as Cano puts it, as she grows into adulthood. The theme could still have come across if they made Sean older, but there&apos;s naturally more tension in creating a teenage character who is forced to be a parent to their younger sibling way before they are ready. The idea of what it means to evolve as a parent comes off stronger. The moral choices in Life is Strange 2 are difficult to make, but that&apos;s the intention&#x2014;to try to make the right decision for Daniel even as he&apos;s showing how much he hates you by levitating a giant tree trunk out of a lake. (Kids&apos; emotions can be scary, man.) It&apos;s even harder to make moral choices when you&apos;re forced into a lifestyle that most would consider immoral for children. So when it came to choosing a location for episode three, sending Sean and Daniel to Humboldt County was a logical choice. When you&apos;re fugitives on the run, there&apos;s not much you can do to earn money legally. Working as trimmers on an illegal marijuana farm shielded by the dense Humboldt County forest was the perfect option. &quot;We wanted to put Sean and Daniel in this situation. They have to accept the fact that they are working for dangerous people, but they have no choice if they want to go to Mexico.&quot; While the team read books,...",1559938560,

As we remain committed to keeping you up to date with the latest, we are currently considering ways to share Episode 3 content and release specifics earlier than we did for previous episodes. As an episode only comes together visually towards the very end of development, we'll be getting creative with how we present that content! We are also looking at the best ways to share more behind the scenes information in both video and picture format through our social channels, so stay tuned for that in the near future. These written developer updates will continue to provide development phase information as before. We hope that all these new pieces of exclusive content will make the wait in-between episodes feel a little shorter. As always, we appreciate your patience and continued support! https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/b96f83afaba5f4b3e491abada8b9f10de1f25379.jpg In a previous developer update for Episode 2 we shared some details around our internal playtests. We have reached a similar stage for Episode 3, having completed the internal and external playtests last week. Feedback gathered during these tests will help us push episode through the final stages of development. It is always intimidating to see players play an unfinished episode, as many things do still look rough, but these tests continue to be a great source of information! The final voice-over (VO) recording session for Episode 3 also took place this week. We always plan this final VO recording session after having received the playtests report, because in addition to the lines that might be missing or that need to be changed, the players' feedback can well lead to extra VO lines. As an example, if we see that some players are lost for too long without knowing what to do next, we can add extra internal voice lines for Sean that give hints about how to progress. Speaking of voice-overs, we wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate Roman George, the voice actor for Daniel for his ""Best Young Actor ¦ Voice Over Role"" nomination! https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/b9b819ff0b25cb2aec590e7376d9f6d2a3cb30b9.jpg While he is already working on Episode 4 concept art (you can see a bit of this process for Episode 1 here), our Lead Artist Edouard Caplain has started to work on the Episode 3 Key Art. This is a very important piece of art that has the huge responsibility of not only setting the tone of an episode when it is revealed, but which also will have to represent this episode on your favorite stores for the rest of its life. No pressure Edouard...! https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/b0477ce8a9b52215c7edd2d2b4a3e6a26036672c.jpg Here are some internal key art explorations that Square Enix' Jan-Wah Li did before Edouard got to work on the final artwork. Similar to the first Life is Strange, even if the full LIS2 story has already been written entirely before working on the individual episodes, we give ourselves the opportunity to adapt the content and make changes during the production of an episode when it feels right creatively. It's the same with the key art: the general idea for the whole season has already been discussed before creating the first one, but individual key arts are usually the last piece of art produced for an episode. We do this for production reasons, but it does also feel like the perfect time to do it because the artist can more accurately convey the mood of an episode and its characters.

It's been a little while since we released Episode 2: Rules and we are still hard at work on Episode 3 and 4. We hope to provide an update about Episode 3's progress soon. Taking a step back for a moment to refocus on Episode 2, we have just released a patch which will address a number of issues that some of you may have encountered while playing Episode 2. All fixes noted as RESOLVED in our post here are now included in today's patch. But how did we get here? Should you be interested in finding out a bit more about what exactly the process of bug tracking and patching is, read on! Whenever we launch an episode, we have a large multi-disciplinary team on standby carefully watching and monitoring all aspects of the launch. Our community team as well as some elements of the QA team will monitor the hotspots of player chatter - Steam forums, Reddit, Youtube, Twitch and Resetera all provide really valuable touchpoints of information for any issues that are being reported. In the hours following a launch, we then triage reported issues according to the amount of people encountering them and whether a reported issue is code-related (i.e. ""a bug"") or whether it might be user related (such as running the game on below spec hardware or with outdated drivers). We generally try to refer the latter type of cases to our customer support team, who can work with each user individually to investigate their specific hardware and who are most of the time able to resolve those issues by themselves. When we see a certain number of users encountering code-related bugs, we report these bugs via a unified communications space. It is here that the community team will provide the rest of the team with as much detail as they are able to glean from user reports. Our QA team in Montreal will then set to trying to reproduce that same bug with the steps provided by the community team. Should they be able to successfully reproduce an issue, the development team are provided with a full bug-list entry which includes all information to allow them to experience the bug themselves and thereafter investigate what might be causing an issue with that part of the code in particular. This cycle needs to be completed for each individual bug that gets reported online. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/8398dade6285db29f54113670a58adfc4ad97e91.jpg Here's one of the shorter threads in action, right around the launch period of Episode 2! Some issues are able to be re-produced (and consequentially resolved) quite quickly, however, some others will prove very difficult to trigger, but that's where you as our community really come in strong! One example of this would be an issue that caused certain players save game files to delete themselves after the player had completed Episode 2 on PlayStation 4. This is what we would class as a Priority 1 - MUST FIX - issue as it is so detrimental to the gameplay experience and something that we commit a lot of time and effort to. Patches for Priority 1 will be released as soon as possible, while Priority 2 and 3 issues will usually be bundled together en-mass with the closest Priority 1 patch (this is to help reduce the number of patches - the more patches a game has, the more complicated it becomes to analyse). With this issue in particular, we really struggled to reproduce it on our side despite all of our best efforts. Every day we gathered more information from players who had encountered this issue and who might be able to provide clues as to what was going wrong somewhere. Eventually we were able to secure a handful of affected save files thanks to some very helpful community members. Up until this point, we were effectively trying to ""break the game"" in the same manner that affected players had in order to try and reproduce the bug. By being given the save files, we essentially had the ""broken state"" game in our hands and could much better understand what the trigger for the issue was. It turned out to be quite a mishmash of unfortunate things all happening at once under very specific circumstances rather than a cut and dried problem! Knowing what the triggers were, however, has ultimately allowed us to resolve the problem. We were able to resolve the root cause and have tested the fix to prevent further PS4 save file losses, which has been approved by Sony for release. The next steps regarding this matter are that we investigate potential solutions that would help players who have lost their save file, and fast track their progress through Episode 1 and Episode 2. However, this is a very complex proposition and we can't at this time provide any details or guarantees that it will be possible to do. Please note that the above is not an issue that was found to be present on PC. Today's patch will incorporate the fixes all issues marked ...",1551178872,['patchnotes']

532210,Patch Notes - 01 February 2019,"Update 26 February 2019: We have today released a patch that fixes all issues marked as in this post Hello everyone, We've just released a patch for Life is Strange 2 that fixes a small number of issues that we observed with the launch of Episode 2. We have additionally already managed to apply hotfixes for some issues related to systems outside the game (such as the end-of-episode comparison stats). Thank you so much to everyone for your patience as we continue to track and resolve reported bugs. Life is Strange 2 Episode 2 is the most complex episode we've released to date. The amount of choice & consequence branches and the different world states that each player experiences individually means that tracking down and reproducing glitches or bugs can be tricky without a great deal of supporting information. The keystone to finding and fixing a bug lies in being able to reproduce it. This will allow us to understand what might be triggering the abnormal behaviour and resolve the issue. With that in mind, we have listed below a number of bugs for which we require additional information in order to be able to reproduce them on our systems. If you have encountered any of these bugs, please do share your experience with us in the designated threads. Here is a truncated list of bugs that we have been able to resolve internally and that we are currently testing the fixes for. Should these fixes be approved by our QA team, they will be combined into a single patch in the near future, and we’ll have more information on a firm release date soon. Bugs marked RESOLVED here have been fixed internally but are not yet live in today’s patch. Gameplay stat issues, including some stats not tracking properly - RESOLVED Various clipping issues - RESOLVED Chris and Charles are invisible during the final sequence of the Christmas Market - RESOLVED Charles reappears in an unexpected location during the Christmas Market scene - RESOLVED Stephen is invisible in his office under certain conditions - RESOLVED Certain character animations break if player reloaded the last checkpoint - RESOLVED Certain props and objects do not behave as intended - RESOLVED Certain animations or options fire twice under specific circumstances - RESOLVED SFX do not trigger properly in certain locations/world states - RESOLVED SFX loop continuously in certain locations/world states (such as the running water in the breakfast scene) - RESOLVED Incorrect text is displayed after Episode 2 is completed - RESOLVED Missing text localisations on certain screens - RESOLVED Camera can become locked when triggering ""look"" and ""look for Daniel"" features simultaneously - RESOLVED Laundry floats out of Sean's hands when opening the pantry door - RESOLVED Choosing an option during the cougar scene is not possible if certain buttons are held during a previous interaction - RESOLVED Here is a list of issues that we are attempting to reproduce, but for which we require additional information: BUG MC-37: Sketches from Episode 1 disappear in Episode 2 - If you have been affected by this issue, please help us by responding in this thread BUG MC-43: Daniel falls through the floor at the grandparents house - If you have been affected by this issue, please help us by responding in this thread Please note that we are tracking and have reproduced a number of other bugs not listed here and are investigating fixes for them too.

532210,Keep your damn minigames off my damn adventure game lawn,"Pick up any game released in the last ten years and you&#x2019;ll more than likely come across a minigame or two in them. For the most part, I expect to see them in almost every game I play, especially games with long campaigns. They&#x2019;re not always the greatest, as <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/best-minigames/""> we have talked about </a> in the past, but when minigames are done right, they create a interesting layer of interaction that can break up some of the monotony and maybe give you a relaxing break. When done wrong, they create confusion, frustration, sometimes to the point where you&#x2019;ll never pick up the game again. (I&#x2019;m looking at you, Fallout 4: Far Harbor with your DiMA&#x2019;s &#x201C;forgotten&#x201D; memories minigame.) With narrative adventures, the story is the driving force. They can function fine without minigames. Sure, in some cases it wouldn&#x2019;t make sense to take them out, like the cannery mini game in What Remains of Edith Finch, but if the gameplay doesn&#x2019;t meld with the story, the minigame will just slow down the pace. With narrative adventures, the story drives the game, not the gameplay.&#xA0; Playing the latest episode of Life is Strange 2 over last weekend showed me just that. In addition to bringing back its<a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/life-is-strange-2-has-a-confident-opening-episode-and-an-awful-sketching-minigame/""> sketching minigame </a>, episode two adds a dice game that Sean and Daniel play to pass the time and forget about their grueling travels. The rules of the minigame aren&#x2019;t directly explained, but from what I gathered, rolling specific numbers allows you to outfit your pirate ship with a captain, crew, and supplies, which in turn gives you a specific number of points. The person with the most points wins. This minigame is not fun. The characters repeat the same dialogue as you sit there clicking and clicking for both characters to roll the dice. Thankfully, you can end it early, let Daniel have his victory, and move on with the story that is already moving slowly. This isn&#x2019;t the first time I&#x2019;ve felt this way with a minigame from any of the Life is Strange games. I didn&#x2019;t exactly enjoy scrounging around for car parts and d&#xE9;cor as Chloe in Life is Strange: Before the Storm to fix up her truck. The first tabletop campaign was entertaining, but when the second one came around in the third episode, I wanted it to end as soon as possible so I could get back to the main storyline. I don&#x2019;t recall there being any minigames in original Life is Strange, and that&#x2019;s probably why I feel that game has the strongest story out of the three. Narrative adventures&#x2014;branching narrative, walking sims, text-based, point-and-click&#x2014;occupy a still experimental space between traditional prose and film. The Life is Strange games excel at filling quiet moments with emotional monologues or dialogue. The moments where the character can sit alone and let their raw emotions flow as the camera pans around the scenery and bittersweet music swells are some of the most powerful types of scenes in the Life is Strange games. They&#x2019;re powerful not just because we&#x2019;re seeing the character in a vulnerable state, but because they are doing something to either advance the plot or develop the character further on their journey. The dice minigame is a missed opportunity to do just that. Every scene should have meaningful conflict. Every scene should have meaningful conflict. But what can kill an otherwise good scene or free flowing plot is a minigame forced into the story to help &#x201C;gamify&#x201D; it. If it&#x2019;s considered good game writing to meld the narrative with the gameplay, should these minigames not also explore conflict? Should they not also move the plot along or continue developing characters? Going back to the cannery scene in What Remains of Edith Finch, it&#x2019;s not just about multitasking, cutting the heads off the fish while navigating the rivers of your kingdom in your daydream. You are living through the character&#x2019;s last moments; the pace of that character&#x2019;s story isn&#x2019;t slowed down by the minigame, and neither is the game as a whole. If we look at The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, every one of Ethan&#x2019;s stories you come across is a minigame, but they all work alongside solving his disappearance because they gradually build on his character until you realize what fiction writing really meant to Ethan. It&#x2019;s freakin&#x2019; heartbreaking. I&#x2019;m not here to just pick on Life is Strange 2. There&#x2019;s other narrative-adventure games with questionable minigames, even one of my favorites&#x2014;The Red Strings Club. While the bartending minigames were integral to Donovan&#x2019;s character, I didn&#x2019;t like Arkasa-184&#x2019;s pottery adventures. The material you shape is biomatter instead of clay, and what you&#x2019;re doing is turning the biomatter into personality alternating implants. But why does the biomatter need to be thrown like clay? This is supposed to be a high-tech world, and yet the game is askin...",1548895640,

But what does that actually mean? That the episode has been approved by Sony and Microsoft to be released on their platforms for January 24th. Being “Gold” is an old (or ""legacy"") term going back to the CD-era when the master version of a game, usually on a golden CD (or similar), was final and ready to be duplicated in order to create all purchaseable copies of the game. In the video game industry this is only possible after passing the final step before a game can be published: the submission phase, also known as certification. Even a digital-only game like ours has to go through submission phases, so we still use this term nowadays. Every console game published has to meet quality requirements specific to the platform holders (Sony and Microsoft in our case). Developers usually have access to those requirements through specification documents (and sometimes even private support) that indicate how applications must behave in various situations. One example of this would be what exactly needs to happen when your controller runs out of battery during gameplay. Such requirements help platform holders ensure that the user experience is as good as it can be on their platform and that it remains consistent across a wide variety of titles. Spec documents cover many things ranging from big features (like the fact that a game must remain stable after the console has been put into and turned on from sleep mode), to the use of small terminology details (such as what terms we're allowed to use for XYZ controller buttons). A division of a publisher's QA team (Square Enix Montreal in our case) is often dedicated to running tests (that we call Compliance tests) for us so that by the time the platform holders receive our ""submission"", all the things they look out for should be resolved and the game should, in theory, be able to pass certification on it's first go. Should the platform holders fail a submission, similar to an exam, you must re-submit your entire game… So, much like many people anxiously wait for exam results, developer teams wait for submission results. It's always a great moment for the teams when their game or episode passes submission! For an episodic game like Life is Strange 2, we need to go through many ""exam"" submission phases: 5 episodes and 2 consoles... If you ever wonder why release dates of episodes are usually only announced a few weeks in advance, it is most often because we want to make absolutely sure that the game will be out at the announced date. That’s why we prefer to communicate the date not when an episode has completed development on DONTNOD’s side, but rather when we have successfully passed certification (the submission phase)! But what about PC? Due to the constantly evolving nature of PC gaming and the multitude of device configurations compared to consoles, specific requirement checks across all games are harder to maintain and test against. However, to ensure that the game adheres to their standards of quality, Square Enix employs another QA division (called TQA), which specializes in testing the performance and the technical specifications of the PC versions. This team has to test hundreds of compatibilities between various hard- and software configurations and make sure that the experience on PC is as good as it is on console while also providing PC specific functionality like dedicated display options. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/56d0d00c1ef3eb0a815498c5b6337142a9110c01.jpg QA is serious business. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/71da4cc98b30b6376a0f01d6ef32ab3caa14047d.jpg The Enzyme Compat QA team So while the majority of the team had already fully switched to the development of Episode 3 (and very early stages of Episode 4!), the QA teams in Montreal and at DONTNOD as well as the submissions teams were still closely following the certification process. These groups will also maintain a sort of surveillance unit and work with the community and customer support team after Episode 2 is released in order to identify bugs that may have not been found during the test phases and work on fixes for a later patch (which by the way also requires a submission for each platform!). That brings us to today - Press previews of Episode 2 should be releasing in the very near future. ahead of next week's Episode 2 launch on January 24th.

Some bugs can be very complex to reproduce and need thorough investigations that can last several days, while some sneaky ones can be easily missed and need the testers to be very rigorous even if they have played a scene hundreds of time over… Thankfully there are always some funny ones you simply cannot miss: https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/08f1dd86fd6dea9bd8e1b24b1760becdef9ffeb0.jpg A horror encountered during The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit's development. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/6d504fbf2b8b6f0b7c1c619aa4080ab2dc678a84.jpg No Lyla, you weren’t meant to be wearing camouflage face paint in this scene, even if we were still in development of Episode 1. In addition to searching for various functional issues, our testers have to track a lot of other things too: the performance, compatibility with various PC hardware configurations, console manufacturers requirements and many more... We are very happy with the great work provided by Square Enix’s QA team in Montreal. Many members of this team already worked on the first Life is Strange and are quite familiar with the complexity of testing Episodic games, and their meticulous work is critical for us. With the communication tools we have though, it is quite easy to forget the time difference and distance between our teams! https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/b519a37f3239e0325fc2efd45505d43080ba9015.jpg Square Enix' QA team In addition to Montreal’s team we also have a small internal QA team (usually called dev-testers) at DONTNOD, and their presence is invaluable to any dev studio. Their proximity to the rest of the team allows them to test specific features while these are still in development, discuss the details of any issues indepth and make sure we don’t send broken builds to the big team in Montreal! https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/a4528ed73c028c14172cd0176ca5528be6d8ea78.jpghttps://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33068697/d631b2e7e664082fa029c8d62a51d891e25962a2.jpg Our very own DONTNOD QA team! A misconception many people have is that QA is an ""easy"" job. It does in fact take an expert attention to detail and an ironclad commitment to always doing the best job possible without cutting corners. Identifying and then even reproducing certain bugs can take skills of which even the best detectives would be jealous! Not to mention the ability to write reports that explain in the simplest possible terms all the in-game gymnastics you had to jump through in order to trigger a bug or a crash. The whole Life is Strange team is working very hard at the moment to make sure you have a great Episode 2 ready to play in January, but we wanted to give a special shout out to the QA teams this week! This will be our final developer update for 2018, as our upcoming news updates will be focusing on delivering you the big news about Episode 2, but we will be back in the new year to provide you with further behind the scenes insights on Episode 2's road to release and the ramp up to Episode 3 (on which work already began some time ago). For now though, we want to wish everyone a warm, safe and happy start to the holiday season and hope that you can enjoy the weeks leading up to Christmas and New Year!
