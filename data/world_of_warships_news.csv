Take command of special missile-armed warships with the ability to respawn. You'll be tasked with large-scale Operations where your team must contest a massive map divided into sectors—and you'll be going up against a bigger fleet of bots! To wield this brand-new armament—brought back from the future through a rift in time—mark your target area and launch. If an enemy is present, your missile will home in automatically. Simple! The free rewards for this battle type include four new unassigned Commanders. What are ""unassigned Commanders""? We're glad you asked! They initially have no nation or ship specialization—but once assigned to a ship of your choosing, they permanently take on its nation and flag. Aside from that, they operate like regular Commanders. Seize Key Areas for support, secure bases, and rain down missiles on your foes! EU European Commanders!

552990,Temporal Rift,"The year is 2050. The New Earth Alliance safeguards global stability and maintains a fragile peace after the Era of Wars. But not everyone accepts this peace. The techno-driven organization Citadel of Return consists of modern techno-radicals who believe they alone have the right to decide the planet's fate.Citadel of Return's sabotage of the SABER-777 AI's trials sent several Alliance ships based on old designs, but armed with modern weaponry back in time. There, they are awaited by a modified flotilla of the Citadel, which had been hiding in secret World War II bases. Now these two forces stand face to face—and battle is inevitable.Inside: Technology from the future. Outside: A look grounded in the past. This will be a brutal fight…Update 14.10 welcomes Temporal Rift: a new PvE event battle type with explosive attack-and-defense gameplay and missile weaponry.Temporal Rift consists of two Operations—Shattered Time and Rift Watch. They will be available sequentially during Update 14.10 for 2 weeks each. After that, both Operations will rotate randomly during the first 2 weeks of Update 14.11, giving you plenty of time to enjoy new battle type and collect all the rewards.Read on to see what exactly the time warp has brought to the game!ASIA29 October 2025, 19:00 UTC10 December 2025, 19:00 UTCEU30 October 2025, 02:00 UTC11 December 2025, 02:00 UTCNA29 October 2025, 09:00 UTC10 December 2025, 09:00 UTCBriefing Time: Event RulesShattered Time and Rift Watch have shared core mechanics, but your task in the first Operation is to press the offensive, while in the second—you're tasked with standing firm in defense.Join a nine-player team to battle against waves of bots on a very large, Arctic-inspired map. It's divided into three defense lines, with three sectors in each containing varying numbers of Key Areas. The first two lines of defense lie ahead of the attacking team before breaching the enemy base in a climactic final battle at the heart of the anomaly.A few additional rules govern this chrono-distorted battlespace:The next defensive line unlocks when you capture enough Key Areas in the previous one.Capturing each Key Area will destabilize an aspect of the enemy base defenses, reducing the effectiveness of artillery forts, repair ships, and aircraft carriers at the base.You will move to the next defensive line when the timer runs out regardless of whether you fail to capture enough Key Areas.While capturing defense lines is the primary task, failing this won't end the battle. Defeat only occurs if you fail to capture the enemy base in time.However, you should strive to win at each line. Even if you lose the first one, for example, capturing the second will still weaken the enemy base.Moreover, capturing Key Areas as soon as possible both softens the base defenses and buys more precious time for your final showdown.Hint: Check behind the isles for those pesky aircraft carriers and repair ships. You want to destroy them first, so look out for an unusual concentration of planes in the air or a red healing circle on the water.The enemy base has two small Key Areas; capturing one is enough to win the battle.When your ship is destroyed, the Rift will not expel you entirely. Similar to the Unbreakable Line event, you will rejoin the fight, though there are some changes to the mechanic:You return with temporary buffs to speed, concealment, acceleration, and maneuverability.Additionally, all of your consumables and missiles are replenished. Your torpedo launchers will be instantly ready even if they were in the process of reloading before you were sunk.You can choose the exact respawn sector to return to and rejoin the fight.As you push forward to a new defensive line, the respawn sectors shift forward as well, ensuring you can keep up with the advancing frontline.Note that in Rift Watch, where your team will be tasked with defending the base and the Key Areas from bot attackers, you'll get to take advantage of the base's defense bonuses (artillery forts, repair ships, and aircraft carriers) as well. Beware though: Those advantages can be eroded if enemy bots manage to capture Key Areas.Incoming: Missile FeatureMissiles are a new offensive feature that can inflict heavy damage and are available only in Temporal Rift—both for players and some bots (you will spot them by the ""M"" prefix in their ship’s name). Player ships are equipped with countermeasures to help defend against this threat. Missiles add an entirely new layer of gameplay and tactical approaches to Temporal Rift, and this is how they work:MissilesEach ship has a limited number of missiles. They replenish upon ship respawns, but there are some other ways to resupply as well.To launch a missile, select it (""4"" by default), choose the desired area within range, and fire. That's it!There's no need to guide the missile manually, it will do its lethal job itself.Upon approaching the center of the selected area, the missile will scan for enemy targets there:If a...",1761817647,

For more information, visit the relevant link: EU NA ASIA IMPORTANT! Because the update is still being tested, the information in this article is tentative and reflects the state of game development at the time of its publication.

It means that when your ship gets destroyed, you'll be spared a trip back to Port and will be sent back into action aboard the same ship you sailed into battle.

The ship stands out for her deadly accuracy and strong AP shell performance, which together help her tear through enemy broadsides like a can opener. The ship's construction consists of 20 Dockyard phases; 18 of these will be completable through in-game combat missions. Individual phases can be purchased for Doubloons, and as usual, there are two starter pack options to get a head start. At Phase 8, you'll pick up Commonwealth cruiser Gambia as an intermediate reward. Unlike her sister ship Fiji, Gambia has access to HE shells and Short-Burst Smoke Generator, making her a brutal combatant against enemy battleships. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31013613/cb1d22eb0ce8ed1366652c95fa23eb9f27de63b1.jpg Efficiency Badges {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31013613/17128fcc2a59fd3af73a25f6bbad11bf40b45acd.jpg With Update 14.3, you'll be able to earn Efficiency Badges as a mark of personal pride for your performance aboard individual ships.

Get a comprehensive breakdown of all the new features and changes in our dedicated article: EU Experiment With New Experimental Ships {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31013613/1a2f0a022212304637214881c09af2ca639a04ab.jpg From now until August 2025, you'll have free rein to play around with some quirky new ships subject to quirky new mechanics. For now, in Update 14.2, you can unlock and play cruisers Metz, Oregon, and Vyazma. These three ships have access to what we're calling ""Fight or Flight""—a mechanic where your ship becomes stronger the more damage it takes. The trio also has access to a limited stockpile of AP shells with improved characteristics that can be fired using Burst Fire mode. You can unlock experimental ships by researching their components in exchange for a combination of Credits and Action Reports, the latter of which are obtainable via special combat missions. For more information about experimental ships, see our dedicated article: EU Dive Back Into Operations with Flagships {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31013613/a4802c0204dd8b84e967d1d08433363cbd8805a8.jpg Back by popular demand, Operations with Flagships have received a few tweaks in Update 14.2 to make them that much more engaging. Now, three enemy bot flagships of two different types with different effects and vulnerabilities await you on the battlefield. The flagships will be randomly selected, and you'll see which ones you'll be up against at the start of the battle. You can now also equip one Classified Document per battle to customize your ship's capabilities against certain ship types, working both against ordinary bots and the flagships themselves. This special mechanic will make your ship more effective in encounters with specific enemies. All details about the tweaks to this battle type can be found via this link: EU Discover a New Branch of Soviet Submarines in Early Access {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/31013613/25fc410079f68b8f608ffdc298b5b128c1e7fb88.jpg Three new submarines—S-1, L-20, and K-1—make up the latest branch of the Soviet Tech Tree, which is now available to play in Early Access. These subs make use of capable unguided torpedoes to deal the bulk of their damage. They enjoy good surface speed but lack the agility and dive capacity for frequent underwater escapades. The trio can be of great help to their allies, as they have access to the Submarine Surveillance consumable with a long range. All three submarines are available in sequential bundles in the Armory, purchasable for Soviet Tokens. You can obtain the Tokens by completing combat missions or purchasing random bundles.

Designed for bold Captains, these vessels bring high-risk, high-reward gameplay: These experimental ships start each battle with reduced HP but can heal over time. Where it gets very interesting is that their main battery accuracy and rate of fire improve as their HP decreases. Will you choose the security of HP or the risky but satisfying firepower route? Armed with a limited stock of AP shells with improved characteristics and Burst Fire mode. They have no module upgrades, their economic earnings are similar to same-tier Tech Tree ships, and Commanders assigned to experimental ships do not require retraining. You can unlock experimental ships by researching components with Credits and Action Reports from combat missions, and get a special mission chain that offers Coal as a reward. These ships will be removed with Update 14.7, and commemorative rewards will be bestowed on players who successfully unlock all three.
