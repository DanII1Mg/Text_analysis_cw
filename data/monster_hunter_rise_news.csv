Valve did update the Proton Hotfix which would allow the game to run some hours earlier, but the official fix is now live. <strong>Update 1 22/01/24:</strong> The official Monster Hunter Rise Twitter (X) account has acknowledged the issue on Steam Deck, promising a hotfix to be released ""in the very near future"" but stopping short of confirming what the issue is, or if it is related to the inclusion of Enigma DRM. <strong>Capcom</strong> has added DRM (digital rights management) to <strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong>, effectively removing its Steam Deck verification in the process.

Taken down any of recently added Risen Elder Dragons yet and claimed their powerful armour sets? Today we’re wiredashing by with the latest Free Title Update 4 sneak peek from Sunbreak’s Director Suzuki! Last week Director Suzuki introduced the “Hunter Loadout” feature that’s coming in February, streamlining the loadout process by combining your item, equipment and layered sets into one loadout option! You can read more about it HERE. This week we’ve got even more quality of life goodness for you, this time around Sunbreak’s endgame, Anomaly Investigations… Hey, everyone! In Free Title Update 4, adjustments will be made to Anamoly Research Requests. You'll be able to clear the Research Request conditions by clearing an Anomaly Investigation at the specified level. Slaying the target monster will now earn you a bonus. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/f3d95ef1bd13dbcae768dee12d8ac8edc5df63f8.jpg - Suzuki, Sunbreak Director What does this mean for you?

On top of that, slaying the target monster is now classed as a bonus, not a primary objective. Instead, taking down the target monster will give you extra completion progress and a generous boost to your research points. That wraps up today’s post from Director Suzuki! Before we head off, have you been diving into 2023’s new Event Quests?

1446780,Kamura Hunter’s Hub #16 – Developer’s Challenge & Buddy Spotlight!,"Hey Hunters, Happy New Year and welcome to Kamura Hunter’s Hub #16! We hope you’ve been having a great time with Free Title Update 3! Taking on the newly added Monsters, crafting powerful new gear and delving even deeper into Anomaly Investigations, as well as the expanded Followers system! What’s been your favourite parts of the latest Title Update? Let us know in the comments at the end of the post, we really appreciate hearing your thoughts! (Also, feel free to share some cool mixed sets you’ve been making with the new gear!!!) Now, back to today’s post! We’ve got a Sunbreak Developer double-bill for you as we share some challenging hunt gameplay straight from the team, as voted for by the community on Twitter, and put a spotlight on the Dev Teams very own buddies that they take out on hunts – including those of both Rise and Sunbreak’s Directors! Let’s jump in! The Sunbreak Developer’s Challenge Since mid-October, the Sunbreak Dev Team have been putting their skills on display in the Sunbreak Developer’s Challenge, taking on Event Quests as they showcase their moves against a range of Sunbreak’s monsters! Each Developer that takes part has also been sharing a “Challenger’s Comment” with some fun insight at the end of their clip – we’ll share those under the videos too! The first one dropped on October 14th, with subsequent ones being voted for by the community on Twitter! Let’s take a look at what hunts have gone down so far… Hunt 1 – Dual Blades Things kicked off in style as one of Sunbreak’s Game Designers took on the Event Quest “Dual Threat: Go Out with a Bang!”, tasking them with taking down not one, but two Seething Bazelgeuse with their dual blades! It turns out our Game Designer was quite the fan of Spiral Slash, and they took a moment to explain why: “I’m a game designer on Sunbreak. I mostly focused on using the Spiral Slash this time. The MHGU team had a hunter art naming content, and “Rasenzan” (Spiral Slice) was actually my idea! I hope you all give it a spin.” Following that we held a weapon poll for the next video between Long Sword, Gunlance, Charge Blade and Bow, with the winner being… Hunt 2 – Gunlance! That’s right, Gunlance’s explosive personality blasted it to victory in the community poll! Another brave Sunbreak Game Designer stepped forward, Gunlance in hand and took on the Event Quest “Dual Threat: A Returning Rush of Red”, pitting them against the fearsome Elder Dragons, Malzeno and Shagaru Magala… We saw many comments from Gunlancers that our Developer had an unexpected, yet effective playstyle, encouraging them to try it out for themselves! What could have led to this playstyle? Well, it turns out this particular Game Designer worked very closely with the Gunlance on Sunbreak: “I’m a game designer on Sunbreak. I used different Switch Skill Swap Scrolls for each monster. I designed the Reverse Blast to offer both good offense and defense. It’s quite a lot of fun to blast around with the Gunlance, so I hope you give it a try!” Then came the next poll, pitting Sword & Shield, Hammer, Insect Glaive and Light Bowgun against each other, with the winner being… Hunt 3 – Insect Glaive! The Insect Glaive gracefully vaulted itself into our third and most recent challenge video! Our third intrepid Sunbreak Game Designer stepped into the arena (literally) against a Crimson Glow Valstrax and Furious Rajang in the Event Quest “Dual Threat: Destructive Stars”! Our Developer used a range of aerial and ground combos to successfully complete the hunt, and even took a moment to share their personal tips for Kinsects: “I’m a game designer on Sunbreak. I tried out the Speed Type Kinsect “Fleetflammer” this time. The Speed Type Kinsect Charge kind of keeps your hands busy, but I feel that gives it a stronger sense of joint combat than the Assist Type. The Kinsect Type greatly changes how the insect glaive plays, so I recommend trying out types you haven’t used before!” What’s next for the Sunbreak Developer’s Challenge? Well, our latest Twitter poll recently with the Hunting Horn being selected as the winner! That means that the next video will be releasing in the near future over on the official Monster Hunter Twitter, so feel free to drop us a quick follow if you’d like to see another member of the Sunbreak team showcasing their skills in the hunt! Buddy Spotlight – Meet the team’s Buddies! Now you’ve seen some of the team in action! But what about our faithful Palico and Palamute pals? If you’re keen to see what Buddies some of the team use, or after some cheeky Buddy build inspiration, we’ve got you covered! We’re currently mid-way through our Buddy Spotlight on Twitter, so we figured it’s about time we looped you in on it too! So, get ready to meet the Buddies of Monster Hunter Rise Director, Yasunori Ichinose, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Director, Yoshitake Suzuki, as well as Sunbreak’s Lead Buddy Designer!

Now, in this part we’re going to be looking at some optional free gear that’s available to assist you as you settle into Rise, should you wish to use it, kitting out your Palico and Palamute Buddies for the hunt, as well as some handy tips for capturing monsters! Let’s get stuck in! Introducing Defender Weapons and Black Belt S Gear! Suit-up with Black Belt S Gear {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/1a89093ff4b5b0c449466ca64d3b4b6a8fa8cda2.png The Black Belt S gear is a set of armour that any player can pick-up from the friendly Felyne, Senri the Mailman, in Kamura. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/afe0810174830ce4c0ef52afaac73cd665675bff.jpg Simply start a conversation with him, select “Add-on content” and then “Accept All”, or seek out the armour in the list of available content. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/9c410c2f0ac1bc9f4761dc950e79e464b6843151.png Once done, head over to your item box and you’ll be able to equip this powerful set!

Grab those Defender Weapons {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/deb6107ee257d97344dcb32d53135efc791f03b7.png Just like the Black Belt S gear, you’ll also be able to get the Defender Weapons in one bundle from Senri the Mailman! The Defender Weapons cover all 14 weapon types, so whether you’re a Hammer smasher, Long Sword wielder or nimble Bowgunner, you won’t miss out! These weapons begin stronger that the equivalent starting weapons and can also be upgraded as you progress through the game, further increasing their strength! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/88c637cc43f70b31f53f17b22545ff46c99afbc0.jpg The Defender weapons not only serve as a great way to start your quest to save Kamura, but also introduce you to the deep and rewarding gear crafting and upgrade system! Of course, whilst useful, these weapons are entirely optional, so check them out if you like, or feel free to explore the huge range of weapons you can craft as you progress through the game. From weapons that cause elemental damage and status effects to those focused on raw attack output, there’s plenty of choice to suit your preferred playstyle and capitalise on monster weaknesses! Some Extra Tips! Helpful buddies (Support) Don’t overlook the importance of your buddies during a hunt! If you’re playing solo, you can bring up to two buddies with you. Mix and match a Palico and Palamute, or even run with two of the same type of buddy. Remember that in a multiplayer hunt, you can only bring one buddy, so make sure you have your preferred buddy in your primary spot! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/f0f46e7025a77aeff977cda9d0424b6dc6f0f26e.png Buddy Skills are another key component that will aid you in progressing through the low and high ranks faster. Regardless of which type of buddy you bring; the Knockout King skill is a great choice that will increase the likelihood of stunning and tiring monsters. If you’re looking for a bit of protection from your Palamute, the Guarding Parasol is a nice aid to protect yourself from a few hits. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/f144e1dbd136299eedda41b35586ea325aed95e1.jpg For Palicoes, you have quite a bit of flexibility on what type of buddy to bring with you. On the community team, we’re big fans of Gathering Palicoes thanks to their Endemic Life Barrage and Pilfer skills! Although the results can be somewhat unpredictable depending on what toad is used (Sleep, Paralysis etc), Endemic Life Barrage’s status ailments are helpful in a pinch when taking on tough monsters. Lastly, this support type does what it says…gather more materials, whether that’s items found around the locale, or extra monster parts using the Pilfer skill! And as we know, more loot is never a bad thing! These are just a few suggestions to get you started, but as with all tips in this guide, feel free to play around with what works best for your preferred playstyle! The Buddy system is flexible and versatile to suit how you want to play, but hopefully these tips give you a good place to start from! How to capture monsters Capturing a Monster can oftentimes be a quick and sure-fire way to wrap up a quest quickly and get you moving up the ranks quicker! Although you’ll be able to tell a Monster is ready to be captured based on its more sluggish behaviour, the two best ways to tell when it’s time to bring the traps out are when your Palico Budd...",1669906396,
1446780,The Path to Sunbreak - New Player Info: Part 1!,"Hey Hunters, Welcome to the “Path to Sunbreak” Community Post Part 1! If you’re brand new to Monster Hunter Rise, or have picked it up recently and are still exploring what Kamura Village has to offer, let us give you a monster-sized WELCOME to the community! Whether you’re looking to fully explore the engaging story and dozens of hours of gameplay Monster Hunter Rise has to offer, or prefer to reach the massive Sunbreak expansion as efficiently as possible, this post is for you! Of course, there is no “correct"" way to play, and all this information is purely optional, so we encourage new players to feel free to progress through Monster Hunter Rise however you would like. As long as you’re having fun, that’s what matters! The Path to Sunbreak SPOILER WARNING – This section contains potential story and monster spoilers for Monster Hunter Rise. If you’d like to avoid these, please click here to skip to Part 2 “Defender Weapons & Black Belt S Gear” – which is spoiler free and covers some cool free gear for your Hunter! This section is for those of you who are looking for a direct route to unlocking the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion content! In order to get started on Sunbreak’s content, in addition to owning the expansion, you will need to have completed the 7-star Urgent Hub Quest Serpent Goddess of Thunder that can be found in the latter stages of Rise’s story. You can then talk to Dame Rondine to start your Sunbreak adventure. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/54aecc49ad17e4b3653ca150843c565357c9c938.jpg Don’t worry about missing any Rise content; starting Sunbreak won’t lock you out of Rise, so you can also choose to continue with Rise’s story and endgame content or play both. Village vs Hub Now you know the destination, let’s look at the two starting points: Village Quests and Hub Quests! Your ultimate goal lies in the Hub quests, so it’s a question of whether you take it from the Hub directly or start with the Village quests instead. Let’s explore each option in detail. Village Quests If you’re a new player looking to immerse yourself in Rise’s story while easing yourself into combat and crafting, this route is for you! Quests are grouped into numbered star levels of increasing difficulty and complexity. Starting at 1-star, you’ll need to complete Key Quests to unlock an Urgent Quest, the completion of which unlocks the next star level! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/ccb3073e38eb91b1f6451aec10cdf889026d1aad.jpg Once you’ve completed the 6-star Village Quests, you’ll be almost ready to move onto Hub quests and High Rank! Hub quests work in a similar fashion, but introduce the concept of Hunter Rank, beginning with Low Rank quests at Hunter Rank 1 and moving up the ranks as you complete Key and Urgent quests. However, here’s a tip for getting through the Hub quests more quickly: speak to Hinoa in Kamura village after you complete the 4-Star Village quests and she will offer three Special Licence Test quests. Completing all three of these challenges will allow you to jump straight into 4-star Hub quests, bypassing the first three star levels! Hub Quests If you’re looking to dive straight into multiplayer and play through Rise with your friends, and are happy to skip the Village side of things, this route’s for you! You’ll know from the “Path to Sunbreak” section that your goal is to complete the 7-star Urgent Quest Serpent Goddess of Thunder, but unlike the Village, in the Hub you’ll be heading on group hunts with other players. (Don’t worry if your party size fluctuates, or if you play solo: all Hub Quests scale based on party size to create a bespoke and fun experience, no matter how many hunters join.) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/c09fcae162830275b46faf901e9dd54ce1d9cdd7.jpg As with Village Quests, you’ll need to complete a selection of Key Quests at each star level, before then completing an Urgent Quest and progressing to the next Hunter Rank. If you’re playing with friends and someone has unlocked the quest, everyone gets credit for the quest completion! Teamwork makes the dream work! In Hub Quests, Hunter Ranks 1-3 are classed as Low Rank, with 4+ falling into the more challenging High Rank category – but with greater challenge comes greater reward! Reach and complete Serpent Goddess of Thunder, and – congratulations! – you’ll be ready to start the Sunbreak expansion adventure and head to Elgado! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/7557e1c57213bc5090adec4c439da7b175c8f860.jpg However, if you’re looking to discover the true ending to Rise’s story, you might want to stick around in the Hub a little longer… Part 1 Complete! That wraps up Part 1 of our “Path to Sunbreak” Community Post, including any spoilery bits! But wait, before you dive back into the hunt, there’s more! CLICK HERE to head over to Part 2, which includes some information on powerful gear you can pick-up for free, equipping your Palicoes and Palamutes, as well as some handy pointers for capturing monsters – speeding up your hunts!

From the new monsters and gear, to the vastly expanded Follower system and those spicy Gunlance buffs – there’s lots for you to get stuck into! Which brings us on to today’s post! That’s right, the Steam Awards are here once again, giving you, our awesome community, the chance to nominate us to win a much coveted award! As you've probably seen, there's a wide range of categories to choose from when nominating a game, so we sat down and had a think about what would best suit Monster Hunter Rise and Sunbreak - and as you can see from the top of the post we chose the ""Better With Friends"" category! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/22b83db945867eae409e3f778e32a3c9f061bc0f.jpg Teamwork makes the dream work!

From rocking it solo with your buddies, and as of Title Update 3, with Followers, to jumping into hunts with other online Hunters, or your friends, there's something for everyone, or just how you're feeling for that gaming session. But then, we all have those moments playing Monster Hunter with friends that make us howl with laughter, or cheer with joy! Seeing one of your buddies get slapped back to camp by a Furious Rajang, or whiffing their ""immaculately"" setup GS wake-up, to saving the party from a triple cart with a clutch Lifepowder or decimating a challenging monster with your finely honed teamwork - those kind of moments and memories that can only happen in a Monster Hunter game! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/93ed82b488fd9d4224729e5dd7d897d36813fcb3.jpg So, fellow Hunters, we humbly ask that you nominate Monster Hunter Rise, because when it comes to multiplayer gaming, Monster Hunter is ""Better With Friends"". Of course, if you think other categories would be more suitable, then please feel free to vote for it! Thank you.

Following on from last week’s Director Suzuki Post, in which he gave us our first look at the new Anomaly Investigation level adjustment feature coming to Sunbreak as part of Free Title Update 3, we’re back with his latest info drop… and this one’s for the Gunlancers! Hey everyone! As part of Free Title Update 3, we will be adding the ability to boost the Shelling Level for Shelling Lv 6 or Lv 7 Gunlances in Qurious Crafting (the maximum is Lv 8). We hope this helps to widen the variety of weapon selections for players. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/bd32c67642fbe9641499082d667b28ea230709ef.jpg - Suzuki, Sunbreak Director That’s right, from Free Title Update 3 onwards, you’ll be able to further upgrade your Shelling Lv 6 & 7 Gunlances via Qurious Crafting up to Shelling Lv 8! We’re excited to see an increased range of Gunlances blasting through Sunbreak’s endgame! Which Gunlances will you be upgrading first and taking into the hunt? Let us know in the comments! For those wondering, Free Title Update 3 will be available to all Sunbreak players in late November, with even more Free Title Updates coming in 2023! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/0fa1d931856bfb6b3f25f00706812b08f400d7be.jpg Thanks everyone!

Starting this week, Sunbreak Director Suzuki has begun sharing some small new details about Free Title Update 3, which is scheduled to arrive late November! The first piece of news dropped today, so let's get our first sneak peek at a new feature that'll be waiting for us in Free Title Update 3... Hey everyone! Free Title Update 3 will let you adjust the Quest Level for Anomaly Investigations. For example, after obtaining a level 31 quest and working your way to level 100 on that quest, you will then be able to freely change the level within that range. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/fb2dc9405dca1da8ef60aca56082158117b1a459.jpg - Suzuki, Sunbreak Director So, if you're wanting to have greater flexibilty over your favourite Anomaly Investigations that you've levelled, this quality of life feature will be for you! Whether you're looking to target farm lower level anomaly materials, or simply play these quests with friends who are a lower Anomaly Investigation level threshold than you, we hope you enjoy trying this out! We'll be back again soon, but in the meantime we'll leave you with the Free Title Update Roadmap that takes us into 2023... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/0fa1d931856bfb6b3f25f00706812b08f400d7be.jpg Thanks everyone!

1446780,Notification of Patch Ver.12.0.1.1,"Available 　October 14, 2022 We have released patch Ver.12.0.1.1 to address the following issue: Bug Fixes and Balance Adjustments After looking into the issue caused by repeated input of gestures and pose sets, we have adjusted the game to accept a maximum of 4 inputs per second in order to maintain Lobby stability. Fixed an issue causing an error to occur if you try to claim the ""Lost Code"" Hunter layered weapon pack (14 types) all at once. Fixed an issue where the great swords ""Chrome Heaven"", ""Antique Machina GS"", and ""Lordly Deathcap"" would have an insufficient number of Anomaly Slots. Fixed an issue causing Risen Chameleos to behave differently for players with an Anomaly Research Level below 100 and players with an Anomaly Research Level of 100 or higher. Fixed an issue causing Violet Mizutsune to keep going around in circles if the player uses a Tricktoad under specific conditions during the M6★ quest ""A Mysterious Pale Flame."" Fixed an issue causing the game to crash if the player uses the ""Equipment Search"" function at the Smithy or in the Item Box if they do not have the right to play ""Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak."" The game now no longer autosaves at the start of a cutscene. Players will no longer be able to accept unauthorized Anomaly Investigations at the Quest Counter. If the player joins an Anomaly Investigation via a Join Request, and the quest is identified as unauthorized, a chat log message will now be displayed to notify the player of this fact. Fixed a bug causing the game to crash when connecting to the ""Nahimic Audio"" sound utility software. Other miscellaneous bug fixes have been made. Notice Monster Hunter Rise does not allow for matchmaking between different versions of the game. If you update the game, you will no longer be able to matchmake with players who haven't applied the patch yet. You can check your current version on the bottom right of the title screen. The Steam version does not support cross saves or crossplay with other platforms.

1446780,Kamura Hunter’s Hub #15 – Title Update 2’s New Armour Skills Overview!,"Hey Hunters, Welcome to Kamura Hunter’s Hub #15! In this week’s post we’re going to be taking a closer look at the new armour skills that arrived as part of Free Title Update 2! These skills are unique to the three new armour sets that can be crafted from defeating Title Update 2’s new monsters and offer interesting new ways to power-up your playstyle, so we thought we’d check them out with you! Director Suzuki also has a message to share about a powerful feature that you can harness by using Flaming Espinas weapons… Before we get into that though, we’d like to say a HUGE welcome to all the new Hunters who joined us in the recent sale. Whether you’re stepping into Kamura for the first time, or taking a voyage over to Elgado Outpost with Fiorayne, we hope you’re having an awesome time – thank you for joining us. Oh and for those new Hunters, if you’re looking for a helping hand, or simply want to get to Sunbreak as quickly as possible, check out our free, optional Black Belt S armour and Defender Weapon set: Right then, it’s time to chat about that spicy new gear! New Monsters, New Armour Skills! Three fearsome new monsters arrived with TU2 in the forms of Flaming Espinas, Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos! They’ve brought the heat, and Hunters that rise to the challenge will reap the rewards! With hot new weapons in the case of Flaming Espinas and Violet Mizutsune, plus new armour sets, skills and decorations for all three monsters, you’re going to be keeping Minayle busy! Flaming Espinas & Intrepid Heart – MR 10 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/22b83db945867eae409e3f778e32a3c9f061bc0f.jpg Flaming Espinas by name, Flaming Espinas by nature! Hunters that manage to take down this fiery monster will be able to start crafting its set of weapons and armour, channelling this monster’s unrelenting nature. As with all other armour sets, there’s a range of skills available for you to utilise, but today we’ll be highlighting its unique new skill, “Intrepid Heart”, which can be found on Flaming Espinas’s Arms and Greaves. Intrepid Heart is a skill with two levels that does the following: After filling the gauge by continuously landing attacks, negates damage reactions and reduces damage taken from a single attack that would knock you back. At level one you’ll get the above effect, and with two levels you’ll reduce damage further and also release a damaging explosion when struck! If you’re looking for a rocksteady offence, this one’s for you! After all, they do say the best form of defence is attack… Violet Mizutsune & Embolden – MR 10 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/142383f4539575d83cd45cac4457e4640c106b94.jpg Sliding in with a barrage of bubbles, Violet Mizutsune is ready to put a singe in the step of any Hunter who dare challenges it! After hunting this monster the crafting can begin as you embrace being the centre of attention for powerful buffs! That’s right, Violet Mizutsune’s set comes with the unique skill “Embolden”, which can be found on its chest, greaves and waist! Embolden is a skill with three levels that does the following: When targeted by a monster, that monster becomes more likely to become enraged but your own defence is increased. Level 1: While active, defence +10, slightly prolongs dodging invincibility and slightly lowers impact when guarding. Level 2: While active, defence +20, prolongs invincibility when dodging and lowers impact when guarding. Level 3: While active, defence +40, greatly prolongs dodging invincibility and greatly lowers impact when guarding. For Hunters that relish being in the spotlight, this ones for you! And about the monsters you face being enraged more? These pieces also come with Agitator to really capitalise on the situation! If you’re looking for a powerful defensive and offensive boost when it matters the most, check out the Embolden skill and the Violet Mizutsune armour pieces it comes on! Risen Chameleos & Buildup Boost – MR 110 Rising up to overcome the affliction, Risen Chameleos unleashes a toxic nightmare to any foolish, or brave enough to confront it. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/d4e34aef67886280428159453e961f4073571dd1.jpg This one’s for the Hunters who, much like Risen Chameleos, head into the hunt with hard hitting offensive status attacks at the forefront of their strategy! Equipping the Greaves, Chest or Arms of Risen Chameleos’s set will grant you the new skill “Buildup Boost”! Buildup Boost is a skill with three levels that does the following: Increases attack power when you land attacks that build poison, paralysis, sleep, blast, or exhaust. (Exhaust - ammo/phials/coatings only) Level 1: While active, increases attack power by 10% Level 2: While active, increases attack power by 15%. Level 3: While active, increases attack power by 20%. Oh yes, landing blows that build status effect will increase your attack power for that strike! We’ve enjoyed seeing the build crafting occurring within the community as they’ve sought to harness the true potential of this skill...",1665162258,

That’s right, you’ll be able to dive into all this new content from tomorrow (or right now if you’re reading this after the date)! For those that didn’t catch the Digital Event live, we thought we’d share an overview of what was discussed, as well as the new update trailer. If you’d like to watch the Digital Event in full, which sits at a little over 15 minutes, we’ll share a link at the end of the post. Now, let’s get stuck in with the new trailer: Title Update 1 – Content Overview As you can see, there’s lots of new content coming to Sunbreak, from new monsters and gear to the expansion of the endgame with more Anomaly Quests, the new Anomaly Investigation feature and Qurious crafting! We’ll be touching on those below to give you an idea of what you can expect, so grab your dango and get comfy… New Monsters and Locale {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/dc497538e441f5538872c3c770f1e0109632f13d.png That’s right, we’ve got four new monsters for you to hunt as part of Title Update 1! Many of you will be aware of Lucent Nargacuga and Seething Bazelguese, but they’re also joined by Gold Rathian and Silver Rathalos, who are more than ready to turn up the heat! Lucent Nargacuga & the Forlorn Arena Lucent Nargacuga is a Rare Species of Nargacuga that was last seen in Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate back in 2013! This Flying Wyvern has the ability to use its bright white fur to refract moonlight, allowing it to become invisible. Think Chameleos, but much more agile! We suggest keeping a lookout for the red glow of Lucent Nargacuga’s eyes… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/7a26c3758d30a8e9958e3286b584bb9e9e7382e2.jpg Oh and watchout for this monster’s vicious poison attacks too! You’ll be taking on Lucent Nargacuga in its home territory, the Forlorn Arena, a returning locale that’s been carefully recreated to preserve and further enhance the foreboding and mysterious ambience of this area… https://media.giphy.com/media/TbB8fpGKmgH0juxApO/giphy-downsized-large.gif Seething Bazelguese Seething Bazelguese is a Variant of Bazelguese with a twist, its explosive scales are constantly active, making it much more dangerous than its base version. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/847e5a160d6fbcfd0aa0ab9484779dfb70b8daaa.jpg Not only that, but it can go into an even more powerful state where it literally seethes with rage where it’ll shower the area with critically volatile scales. Keep on moving and keep a Wirebug handy, just in case! Gold Rathian and Silver Rathalos Two more Rare Species have arrived in the form of Gold Rathian and Silver Rathalos! They can go into a powerful Incandescent state where they’ll attack with even more ferocity, raining blue fire down on all that dare challenge them. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/0ca666e4d0ce2de607967b2ac06c12dbe81d8800.jpg The team have also given them both some new moves for Sunbreak, so if you thought you knew them from hunting them in Iceborne, a whole new challenge awaits you! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/41286238/132dab2236eba3fa8603778c546bad3754c3ddc9.jpg New Monsters, New Gear!
