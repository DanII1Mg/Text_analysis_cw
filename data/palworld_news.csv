1623730,Palworld v0.7 - Home Sweet Home,"2025 has been an incredible year for Palworld, and we’re excited to end the year with v0.7, Home Sweet Home! The purpose of this update is to begin improving existing features, and while this update may not be as content-rich as previous ones, we hope players understand that it’s necessary for us to begin laying the groundwork now as we work on the development of Palworld 1.0. You can find more info about this in our Palworld 1.0 video here:Palworld v0.7 - Home Sweet Home! ▼ ULTRAKILL Collaboration!Palworld’s second collab, ULTRAKILL, finally arrives! This update adds several iconic weapons and armour, as well as a V1’s infamous coin toss! Thank you to New Blood and Hakita for allowing us to play with their incredible game, and we hope our fans will enjoy taking on battles in a fresh, stylish way with this special equipment!▼ Improvements to BuildingA big part of the Home Sweet Home update is, as the name suggests, your home! We have been blown away by all the incredible builds that you guys have been sending us, and we know that you have been eagerly waiting for more freedom in how you design your base. This update brings a large number of new building parts, including the much-requested triangular pieces! Another new addition to the building system in this update is the ability to change the colour of building pieces! Express yourself in any way you feel like by adding a splash of your favourite colour to your home! The building menu UI has been redesigned and reformatted into a list. You can now select the structures and parts you need more intuitively, which should result in an overall smoother building experience! ▼ Raid Battlefields!When summoning a raid boss at the Summoning Altar, players can now choose to either fight at their base as before, or take on the raid boss in a special “Raid Area”. These Raid Areas allow you to fight with all your might, without risking any damage to your base. You can build temporary structures and take items into these special Raid Areas. That’s not all… A new raid boss has also appeared! Team up with your Pals and allies to take on this new formidable foe!▼ Improved Melee CombatMelee is often overlooked in the late game, so we wanted to start improving the system to make it more viable and fun for players. To that end, we have made improvements to the melee gameplay! The basic attack actions for swords, katanas, and beam swords have been changed. You can now perform attacks consecutively by repeatedly pressing left click (right trigger on controller). In addition, special attacks have been added to katanas and beam swords. You can activate a special attack by holding down right click (left trigger on controller) and left click (right trigger on controller). Take your melee gameplay to the next level!This is our first pass at improving the melee combat, and we have even more improvements planned to the melee system for 1.0! ▼ Steam WorkshopWe would like to express our deepest thanks to the Palworld modding community, who, since day 1 have been passionately making so many fun mods for Palworld. We have now added Steam Workshop to the game, allowing players to try out a variety of mods and discover new ways to play with greater ease! If you are interested in modding, please head over to the Steam Workshop for more details! Please note that Steam Workshop is only available for the Steam version of Palworld. Please also note that some servers, including official servers, prohibit the use of mods in order to ensure fair play. To that end, we recommend only using mods in single-player or with your friends.

Show off your skills and compete with other Pal Tamers! Please note that PvP is experimental, and as such, there may be some balancing issues. For more information on how to enable and set PvP parameters on your server, please see the new PvP guidelines in our server documentation: https://docs.palworldgame.com▼ Palworld x Makeship Merch!We're excited to announce 8 brand new plushies, made in partnership with Makeship!Starting today, you can pre-order Zoe or some of your favorite Pals!These plushies are available exclusively at Makeship, and only while stocks last. https://www.makeship.com/shop/creator/palworld Thank you again to all of our fans and players for your continued support for Palworld. We’re hard at work on Palworld 1.0, and are so excited for you to get your hands on the full version of...",1765940666,"['workshop', 'mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1426387032_1765942524_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"
