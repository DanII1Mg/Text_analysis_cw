Your position won't appear on the map. The compass has no directions. Fast travel is gone. You'll have to explore like a real medieval traveller: with your eyes, your wits, and maybe a few questions for the locals... if they even feel like helping you. To start, you'll also choose at least three permanent negative perks. Want a louder, smellier Henry? Choose Sweaty or Heavy-Footed. Want to wake up in a random spot after every nap? Try Somnambulant. Some perks affect combat. Others mess with your inventory. All of them make survival just that bit more precarious. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44983656/2adf4c4c0055015501575a40af771777d671e9ad.jpg This isn't just a difficulty spike, it's a shift in mindset.

As fans of the first game know all too well though, the series’ side quests do an equally essential job of breathing life into this deeply immersive universe. With this in mind, we asked the developers at Warhorse to pick out some of their favourite side quests from the second game. From the macabre to the mischievous, get ready to whet your appetite with a closer look at four such adventures! While we’re excited to share a fun sneak peek at some of the game’s side quests, it goes without saying that this article contains spoilers. You won’t read anything about the main quest by reading on, but look away now if you’d like to keep everything under wraps ahead of launch. The Mouth of Hell The Mouth of Hell is a particularly dark quest that tasks you with investigating a so-called “pit to hell” that supposedly opened during a mining disaster. Not only that, someone - or something - has been killing and mutilating the local farmer’s cattle, and an understandably terrified local population fears a connection between the two events. As Henry, you’ll stumble across this macabre situation in one of two ways. Passing through one of the villages you may notice the horrifying sight of slain or mutilated cattle, and choose to offer your help to the agitated locals. Alternatively, your explorations may lead you to the mine itself, where a stench of sulfur and decay hangs heavy in the air. If you pick up the quest by interacting with the locals you’ll find yourself torn in two possible directions. The young priest Marian will implore you to investigate using reason rather than superstition. Alternatively, you can choose to side with Vladimir, the mining foreman who believes the solution lies in appeasing hell through the “pagan” traditions once practiced by the locals when the pit was first opened. “This is the only quest in the game that could truly be described as survival horror,” says quest designer and scripter Karel Kolman. “It plunges players into a dark, abandoned mine where danger lurks around corners. “Something stalks the corridors, heightening the tension, yet the quest is not just about fear. It also incorporates mystery, investigation and multiple possible outcomes. The player’s choices will determine whether they can piece together the clues and either resolve the mystery, or succumb to superstition.” Forbidden Fruit Forbidden Fruit forms part of a series of quests in which Henry attempts to attend a wedding uninvited. One way of doing so involves enlisting the help of the devious miller Krezjl, who needs assistance himself in sourcing saltpeter for a secret experiment. Given the reputation of millers for thievery and deceit, choosing this alliance is just one of many moral dilemmas you’ll face in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Should you choose to assist Krezjl, you’ll be sent to a lye pit used by the local gravedigger to bury dead animals. Handily enough, it’s also the perfect source of saltpeter! Before taking Henry to the pit, however, the gravedigger first wants help with his own work, which turns out to involve a great deal more than just digging graves and carrying corpses. “The quest introduces some of my favourite side characters: the gravedigger Ignác and the miller’s assistant Bonka!” explains QA tester Petr Šindelář. “Thanks to their friendly personalities, I never have any trouble fully immersing myself in the game and enjoying the stories of ordinary commoners.” The Kuttenberg Tournament The Kuttenberg Tournament is so much more than a side quest. This grand event is one you’re free to participate in repeatedly, once every week. Built around a showcase of daring combat, you’ll need to demonstrate your prowess with sword and shield, long sword, and while fighting in full armor. This event serves as a true testament to the skills and gear you acquire in your adventures across Bohemia, but first you’ll need to do your part in setting up the celebrations. Starting with a quest involving two fencing guilds in conflict, you’ll help the victorious group go on to establish the tournament with the city council. “From a gameplay perspective, it’s an opportunity to enjoy fencing duels with all the pomp and glory they entail, and to fight opponents under equal conditions,” says narrative designer Jonáš Chmátal when explaining his choice of side quest. “From the perspective of world-building and immersive realism, it’s worth highlighting that the tournament exists for all brave townsfolk - not just for the player - and so it will take place in all its glory, even if the player chooses not to participate! “The greatest challenge was to make such a big and complicated scenario work well - with or without the player - in the living environment of Kutt...",1739455202,
