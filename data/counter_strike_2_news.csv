730,Introducing TrueView,"Today we're adding a new feature to demo playback called TrueView. With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely.Previously, demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency. This could be confusing because shots would hit that didn't look like they should have, and vice versa. TrueView provides a more accurate representation of the observed player's experience by re-running their client-side prediction.The video below shows the difference between the old demo playback and the same playback with TrueView.A few caveats:By default, TrueView is deactivated when the version of the game you are using to view the demo does not match the version of the game used to record the demo.Even with TrueView active, there may still be some differences between what you see in the demo and what the player originally saw (especially with slow-motion playback). For example, damage effects will have different timing during demo playback due to the way CPU and GPU work are pipelined.In addition to performing clientside prediction of the observed player, TrueView will also perform Damage Prediction on enemies, if Damage Prediction was used by the observed player at the time. Additionally, we're shipping movement changes that we made available last week in a beta branch. All that and more and today's update!",1762300820,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1426387032_1762303914_0', 'ModAct_1426387032_1762316345_4', 'mod_require_rereview']"
730,Counter-Strike 2 Update,"\Fixed a case where air acceleration was clamped incorrectly while surfing.Fixed a case where slowly surfing up a ramp was handled incorrectly due to misidentification as a jump apex.Fix a bug causing ""Delay Sniper Rifle Un-Scope after Shot"" to be inconsistent.\Added TrueView demo playback, which reconstructs the observed player's original experience more accurately by re-running client-side prediction.TrueView playback will show the effects of Damage Prediction, if it was enabled by the observed player at the time.TrueView does not reconstruct the precise timings of rendered frames, so some differences between the original player's experience and TrueView playback will remain, especially in very slow motion playback. The player's frame at the time when the mouse was clicked, which is used for hit registration, is shown accurately to the nearest demo playback frame. However, reaction effects such as recoil, muzzle flash, blood splatter, and ragdoll are delayed while playing the game by one or two frames due to the way CPU and GPU work is pipelined, and will not appear at the same time during demo playback.TrueView demo playback might not work properly on old demos and is disabled by default if the playback client version does not match the client version when the demo was recorded. You can set cl_demo_predict 2 to override this.Fixed a bug causing third person models to not animate smoothly.Fixed a bug causing time to lurch forward by one tick when unpausing a demo.\Animation fixes for G3SG1 bolt.Fixed developer console scrollbar to accept mouse clicks.",1762300751,['patchnotes']

It's time to start working toward your Season Three Medal. As before, the color of your medal will correspond to the highest CS Rating achieved during the season, and the bars will reflect your total wins, with one bar for every 25 (up to five bars). To be eligible for a medal, you'll need an account in good standing, 25 Premier match wins, and an active CSR at the end of the season. New for Season 3 With the new season comes an update to the Active Duty Map Pool: Overpass is back in, and Anubis is out. There are a few gameplay changes with Season Three. Fire from the incendiary grenade now spreads faster, occupying space rapidly to counter rushing Ts. The MP9 has gotten a bit of a nerf, with a harder to control spray and substantially less jumping accuracy.

Added ""sv_quantize_movement_input"" setting, enabled by default, to keep players from using analog binds to move at fractional speeds that the game is not designed to handle. In cases when servers toggle some game rules from competitive to deathmatch and back to competitive mid-match, the weapons will no longer disappear when dropped on the ground, but toggling game rules settings without reloading the map is not a generally supported workflow for community servers. Added support for turning off text background Added support for grenade types other than Smoke Increased node limit from 100 to 300 Fixed annotation_delete_previous_node not cleaning up particle effects Added ability to rent weapons from all previous CS:GO weapon cases. Added policy settings to enforce client delta ticks order, namely sv_deltaticks_enforce and sv_deltaticks_log, which should help diagnosing configurations causing delta ticks out of order disconnects. Fixed a case where an unlocalized #SLOT prefix could appear in chat.

730,All Aboard!,"We're happy to announce the return of the momentarily lost classic, Train. There's plenty of classic Counter-Strike in every inch of this map—but we also made sure to mix up the gameplay a bit to keep you Train veterans on your toes. We also gave it a full visual overhaul, which means your favorite bleak Eastern European train yard is now 60% cloudier. With a chance of rain? We guarantee it. So queue up and get ready to master the newest version of one of Counter-Strike's most iconic maps. Train is now available in casual and competitive game modes. Overpass Updates and New Community Maps https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/9f20d9e437f8ae93c6f276546599860361b0a50b.png Overpass has received a number of updates based on community feedback, and we're adding four new community maps to the game. Basalt returns to Counter-Strike 2 alongside Edin in casual and competitive game modes, and Palais and Whistle have been added to Wingman. ",1731540112,
730,Counter-Strike 2 Update,"Added damage prediction settings. Damage prediction allows clients to immediately play the audio/visual effects of inflicting damage without waiting for confirmation from the server. Damage prediction can make shooting feel significantly more responsive, but comes with the risk of occasionally being wrong (e.g. due to aim punch, tagging, or a death that your client isn't yet aware of). Predicted body shot effects (disabled by default), head shot effects (disabled by default), and kill ragdolls (enabled by default) can each be toggled separately. Damage prediction is not active when you have high ping. Updated the third-person animation that plays when a player is blinded by a flashbang. The animation now accurately represents the player's visibility level, and the pose will only show the player's arm covering their eyes when they are completely blinded. Fixed a case where legs weren't animating correctly while taking damage. Added ambient occlusion for first person legs to better ground them in the environment. Performance optimizations for molotov and incendiary effects. Added axis labels to the grenade line-up reticle tick marks. The grenade preview camera now shows the result of a jump throw while the jump button is held. Added a map guide for Train, which demonstrates four simple Terrorist grenade line-ups. To load a map guide, go to Play→Practice and toggle ""Load Map Guides"" on. Added concommands annotation_* which enable the creation, saving, and loading of map guide nodes and files, which are stored in /annotations/. New game settings for radar map blending and background opacity. Fixed a case where progress from a previously completed Armory Pass would show during activation of a new pass. Fixed a regression with Chinese input via the Microsoft Input Methods. CSTV now allows setting tv_delay and tv_delay1 to a value smaller than 6 seconds. Charm Template number is now available in Charm descriptions. Train Added Train to Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch modes. Community Maps Added Basalt and Edin to Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch modes. Added Palais and Whistle to Wingman mode. Removed Thera, Mills, Assembly, and Memento from all game modes. Ancient Fixed some lighting errors. Fixed some collision gaps. Fixed some bad wall bang spots. Fixed a stuck spot. Italy Fixed some bad boost spots. Mirage Fixed a pixel peek. Overpass Visual updates to canals area and B-site. Rework of heaven drop down mechanics. Performance improvements, particularly in canals area and B-site. Added a sign that blocks a bad line of sight from long boost to CT spawn. Removed small fence at the edge of party/picnic that interfered with visibility to train station. Removed some geometry under wrecked truck that looked like player legs. Replaced some windows with opaque surfaces in train station to remove bad lines of sight. Deleted a tree that interfered with a line of sight. Moved one of the crate lids on A-site to block a bad line of sight. Removed some lamps that could look like player heads at A-site. Removed some trees and objects around park and train station that prevented players from backing into certain useful spaces. Removed a chain link fence in alley that made players hard to see. Adjustments to fog and decreased the distance at which character models get an increased visibility effect. Made shelf in heaven look less like a player. Adjusted props and lights in heaven to reduce noise and make players brighter. Removed handcart behind barrels at B-site so players can back into the corner. Adjusted collision around barrels for better player movement. Added light behind barrels for better player visibility. Fixed weird collision on barrel that made for inconsistent wall bangs. Fixed bad graffiti rendering at B-site. Removed concrete block behind the cement bags at B-site for less awkward player movement. Set many smaller props to exclude player movement and grenade bounces. Fixed some pixel peeks. Small visual updates throughout the map. Shoots Performance improvements in some areas.

730,Counter-Strike 2 Update,"Fixed a case mid-spray where lag compensation wasn't aware of the user's ""Buffering to smooth over packet loss / jitter"" setting. Improved clock synchronization to better handle downstream jitter bursts. Changed the method for measuring network quality to measure how much network is negatively impacting gameplay. It now measures how often a tick is missed due to network loss or jitter. Added detailed network quality display option, which can be used to display the raw packet loss and jitter numbers. For more details see this article. Prior to the Armory Update, the network quality readout in the telemetry HUD considered packets to be ""bad"" under two circumstances. 1.) If the packet was dropped. 2.) If the packet was delivered out-of-order and was not corrected at a relatively low layer in the network stack. This was not a useful metric for two reasons. First, it counted some misdelivery events as ""bad"" even though they did not negatively impact gameplay. This was especially a problem for packet reordering. Second, it was not counting as ""bad"" packets that arrived late due to network jitter and did negatively impact gameplay. After debugging many instances of gameplay hitches with players, we determined that jitter was causing problems for many players, who believed (quite reasonably) that their network was working perfectly, since there was no packet loss. In an attempt to let these players know that jitter might be the cause of the hitches, we changed the measurement method in the Armory Update on October 2, 2024. Now, we counted a message as ""bad"" if it was lost, if packets arrived out of order in a way that could not be corrected, or if the packets experienced jitter above a threshold. For players on a network connection with significant jitter, suddenly the network quality indicator became significantly worse. Many players assumed that this meant that something had changed to introduce packet loss. Unfortunately, this method of measuring quality was also flawed. The Source 2 Engine automatically adds buffering to smooth over jitter. For many players, these automatic adjustments are enough, and the indicator was counting jittered packets as ""bad"" even when there was not negative impact on gameplay. Today's update changes the network quality readout to only measure network events that are negatively impacting gameplay. See the FAQ for more details.",1731440537,['patchnotes']
730,Counter-Strike 2 Update,"Various adjustments to bullet hit feedback. Fixed a case mid-spray where lag compensation would rewind target hitboxes further into the past than what was on screen. Jumping in place on a sloped surface will no longer result in players sliding a short distance. Fixed a bug where C4 could be defused from any height. Fixes for IK logic to improve third-person feet posing, especially on slopes. Fixed a case where the feet and legs of players could pop out of position when exiting the bomb-plant animation. Reduced animation-related network bandwidth usage. Added more detailed matchmaking stats for players who try to find a match at off-peak times of day. Activating an Armory Pass no longer grants the first Armory Credit immediately. All 40 Armory Credits can be earned by playing and earning XP. Office Fixed geometry in the problematic jumping corner. Ancient Reworked collision on the staircase to A-main for better player movement. Removed a tree that was creating a distracting shadow at A site. Adjusted collision to better match visible geometry so that players can hug the walls more closely. Fixed a few lighting bugs. Reduced shadows to increase perf in some areas. Fixed some spots in house where you could get stuck. Fixed collision gap at the bottom of B ramp. Fixed some disappearing mesh. Nuke Fixed some lighting errors on lower graphics settings. Anubis Fixed a gap in geometry. ",1730939637,['patchnotes']
730,Release Notes for 10/30/2024,Increased jump tolerance for sliding along a surface to fix certain jumps like in the corner outside in cs_office. Fixed a crash in page file usage when Vulkan initialization fails and the game falls back to DX11. ,1730327594,['patchnotes']
730,Release Notes for 10/29/2024,"First-person inspect animation in Inventory and Loadout will now match in-game viewmodel settings and FOV. Fixed a regression with smoke rendering from old demo files. Fixed damage report to show correctly in Casual and Deathmatch game modes. Added sv_jump_precision_enable so servers running certain custom game modes (e.g. surf) can opt out of jump precision improvements. Fixed ""I have to go, my planet needs me."" ",1730247351,['patchnotes']
730,Release Notes for 10/28/2024,"Improved jump height consistency to be within 0.015625 of a unit regardless of distance from the map origin at coordinate (0,0,0). Previously, in both CS:GO and CS2, jump height could vary by up to 0.03125 of a unit depending on the distance from the map origin. Improved consistency of successfully landing on surfaces very close to the maximum height of a jump. Jump height is still affected by stamina; when using cl_showpos 2, stamina at takeoff is reported and output is color coded based on possible jump height. Fixed a bug with cl_showpos display sometimes showing incorrect jump height when jumping from sloped surfaces. Fixed some cases where the client would be pulled back down during a jump because the server disagreed that the jump had taken place. Adjusted weapon pickup logic while near the C4, prioritizing defusing over accidental weapon pick-up. Enemies will now consistently play a flinch animation on the closest hit when the bullet goes through two hitboxes of equal priority (e.g. when both right and left legs get hit). HE grenade explosions within smoke now clear the accumulated smoke screen effect on players inside that smoke within range of the HE grenade explosion. Stability improvements. Dust II Fixed a gap in geometry. ",1730163625,['patchnotes']
