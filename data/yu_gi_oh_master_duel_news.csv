Early Days Collection</strong>, a compilation game that will feature various Yu-Gi-Oh! games from as far back as the Game Boy Color. As confirmed in a press release, the collection will also include titles that weren't previously released in the west. One such game is Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which up to today is a Japan only title. While it wasn't mentioned in the press release, it was also announced that the Game Boy Advance game Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 6: Expert 2, which was renamed to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel for its international release, is also included in the collection. Given that this one did have a worldwide release, it's probably safe to assume we can expect it for the western release too. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/konami-announce-old-yu-gi-oh-game-collection-switch-pc?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1707134896,

Every time I hear that some game dev is using AI, my eyes start twitching with frustration, so you could understand how I might have felt when I read the words ""Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel x AI Project"" in a press release this morning. As it turns out, though, unlike other parts of the industry which just seeks to replace its hard working artists, Konami's Yu-Gi-Oh! AI project is actually what we all used to assume AI in a game was - a computer controlled player. Except, it is the kind of AI that uses machine learning, and its whole purpose is to learn how to play Yu-Gi-Oh! According to the press release, this AI project aims to ""deliver new ways to enjoy Duels in Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel by building a system that allows AI to be installed in the game, enabling Duels in Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel to be played with the AI created by external programs. The AI program grows and learns through continuous Duelling.""
