Agent 47 has his work cut out for him. We&#x2019;re assassinating targets in Hitman using a lotto spinner to choose our weapons. This time, we start at an unsanctioned militia training ground in rural Colorado, where there are a whopping four targets waiting for their unlucky numbers to come up. This includes militia leader Sean Rose and his three lieutenants: Ezra Berg, Penelope Graves, and Maya Parvati.&#xA0; Agent 47 infiltrates the area through the undergrowth just outside the perimeter fence. I spin the wheel and out rolls an eclectic arsenal. Ezra Berg gets number 20&#x2014;fiber wire. Graves gets 3&#x2014;a shotgun. Parvati gets 2&#x2014;a silenced pistol. And Sean Rose get 8&#x2014;an axe.&#xA0; As well as being the least glamorous of 47&#x2019;s many murder-holidays, Colorado is also a hostile area from the start. I slip through the perimeter fence and find myself a basic militia disguise, hiding the knocked-out guard in a conveniently placed dumpster.&#xA0; Able to wander freely, I plan my approach. I decide that I&#x2019;ll tackle Graves last, since a shotgun blast will stir the hive like a bear pawing for honey. Parvati will also have to be handled later, as she hangs around quite a public area.&#xA0; Hence, it&#x2019;s either Berg or Rose first. I settle on Rose, as I know how to get rid of him fairly easily, via one of my favourite mission stories in the entire game. Rose, you see, suffers from OCD, and you can isolate him from his security by triggering it. It&#x2019;s a particularly evil and insidious method, but also satisfying in its subtlety.&#xA0; First though, I need to find an axe. Colorado is a messy level, so I use the online Hitman interactive map to pin down the axe&#x2019;s location. It&#x2019;s embedded in a tree-stump in the far corner of the map. I pick it up with little difficulty, and on the way find a shotgun. You practically can&#x2019;t take a step without falling over a gun in Colorado (just like real life!). I already started with a silenced pistol and fiber wire, so I&#x2019;m now almost completely tooled up for the mission. But I need one more item. Returning to the main house where Rose normally hangs around, I pick up a special hallucinogenic drug&#x2014;used by Ezra Berg in his twisted interrogations&#x2014;which I need to eliminate Rose.&#xA0; I skulk around the back of the house, using the drug to spike the cigarettes Rose habitually smokes. I then try to get into the main house, but the guards are Rose&#x2019;s personal retinue, and won&#x2019;t let in the regular cannon- fodder. I sneak around the security checkpoint to the side of the house, where one of Rose&#x2019;s men hangs around near a crate perfect for hiding bodies inside.&#xA0; I knock him out and steal his clothes, but I&#x2019;m caught in the act by another nearby guard. I pull out my silenced pistol and empty a clip into him before he can raise the alarm. A stupid slip up, and I also have to kill the unconscious guard as he apparently counts as a witness. Still, it could have gone a lot worse. I steal a uniform and hide both bodies in the container.&#xA0; Heading into the house, I tamper with the clock and misalign the pencils on Sean Rose&#x2019;s desk, then exit to the rear and await his arrival. A few minutes later he approaches, disturbed by his skewed stationary. The spiked cigarettes further elevate his panic (this really is a nasty way to kill someone) and he rushes into the toolshed to calm down. I help release some of the tension by slicing open his throat with the axe. Tip of the iced berg One down, three to go. I dump the body and head outside, running almost immediately into the masked face of Ezra Berg. I follow him around the house toward the outdoor entrance of the basement. I realise that, in doing so, we&#x2019;re crossing through the area I cleared of guards earlier. Acting on impulse, I pull out the fiber wire and strangle Berg right there in the open.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s a huge gamble, but nobody notices. However I&#x2019;d forgotten that I disposed of two guards in the nearby body container, filling it up. Consequently, I&#x2019;m dragging around one of Rose&#x2019;s dead lieutenants in an area swarming with guards with nowhere to put the body.&#xA0; Eventually I realise there&#x2019;s another body container just behind the main doors of the house. But between me and it is a security camera. Leaving the body on the patio, I head inside the house, disable the security system, and then head back outside. I drag the body right past the main security checkpoint, into the house where there are at least a dozen guards, and somehow dump it in the container without anybody noticing.&#xA0; Berg down.

Agent 47 is on the trail of rogue Swedish diplomat Claus Strandberg and wannabe military dictator Reza Zaydan. We&#x2019;re killing targets with weapons chosen at random using a lotto spinner. Before we turn the bingo- wheel of fate, however, we need to talk about odds. Last issue, I used a bespoke list of weapons for each level I played, assigning each weapon a number corresponding to a number in my spinner. However, I&#x2019;ve noticed that simply listing all the weapons that appear in a Hitman mission skews the odds in favour of melee ones, simply because there are so many of them. Hence, for this entry, I&#x2019;ve rewritten the list to be slightly more general, to best ensure each weapon class (gun, melee, explosive, environmental) has roughly the same number of entries on the list. You can see this updated lineup in the boxout overleaf.&#xA0; This less stabby list seems to pay off immediately. The numbers for Zaydan and Sandberg respectively are four, which is an automatic weapon, and 16&#x2014;lethal poison. One loud, one quiet, neither melee. Strandberg is holed up in the Swedish embassy south of the market, while Zaydan is preparing his coup at a former nursery school to the east. Gunman, chronicles I decide to head for Zaydan first, the first of multiple mistakes I&#x2019;m going to make on this mission. I start out by re-familiarising myself with the twists and turns of Marrakech market. As I do so, I overhear a conversation about the school&#x2019;s former headmaster, who still has the school&#x2019;s master key. I sneak up to the rooftop garden where the headmaster is, and quietly steal his keyring.&#xA0; Now I need to get past the security checkpoints, so I start scouting for a military uniform to steal. The streets are way too busy, so again I look to the rooftops. Eventually I find a soldier whose patrol takes him to a quiet spot in a rooftop garden. I knock him out with a wrench, don his uniform, and hide the body. This turns out to be a complete waste of time, as the uniform I&#x2019;ve nicked is for a rank too junior to get past the checkpoint.&#xA0; Frustrated, I wander around some more, until I find a guarded entrance to a shop. Hopefully there&#x2019;s a way through to the school. Sneaking past the guards here is easy. I slip through the shop to the rear exit, where there&#x2019;s a small, walled-off courtyard.&#xA0; As it happens, this route leads to a secret tunnel running under the market to the embassy&#x2019;s car-park. I make a note of it for later. Right now, I&#x2019;m more interested in the lone soldier wandering around wearing a more senior uniform. I knock him out, change clothes, and take his assault rifle, which is exactly what I need to kill Zaydan. Suitably disguised, I make my way to the school undisturbed, using the key to get inside. Reyza Zaydan is milling around both floors of the school. He doesn&#x2019;t have any bodyguards, but with so many soldiers patrolling the school, he doesn&#x2019;t need them. Killing him with a Very Loud Gun is going to be tricky.&#xA0; I spend a good 20 minutes examining his circuit of the school. Eventually I notice that he stops by a window on the first-floor corridor, while behind him is an empty classroom with a clear line-of-sight. I stand inside and wait for him to come around again, before putting an end to his ambitions with a single shot to the head.&#xA0; Not very subtle, but it was never going to be. I hope for a repeat of Paris, where I slipped out the window quickly enough that nobody clocked the creepy bald dude making a very quick exit. Sadly, trained soldiers are slightly more perceptive than fashionista bodyguards. The dreaded notification &#x201C;Hunted&#x201D; appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen. I hide until the heat dies down, but my disguise has been compromised, meaning I must sneak out of the school grounds. I can&#x2019;t walk through the checkpoint either, so I shimmy up a drainpipe and creep along a ledge, stumbling right back into the headmaster&#x2019;s garden. Goddamn it. After all that effort, I could&#x2019;ve just slipped down the drainpipe straight into the school. I take out my frustration on the headmaster, knocking him out and nicking his clothes. Now I need to find some lethal poison, so I look up the locations on the Hitman Interactive Map. There are two lethal poison pickups. One is back at the school (sod that). The other is down in that secret entrance I noticed earlier. Retracing my steps, I slip past the guards again and descend. The tunnel reads as a hostile area, so I return upstairs and change into that basic soldier uniform I stole earlier. Ugh, still hostile. The only disguise that will work down here is the one I have already comprom...",1577458806,

If a game like Deus Ex has optional stealth, I will do everything I can to ghost that sucker, while if a game suggests a way of completing an open objective, I will follow that method to the bitter end. Nowhere have I struggled with this more than IO Interactive&#x2019;s recent Hitman games. Their sandboxes are bigger and more choice abundant than most, yet I cannot bring myself to mess around with any of it.&#xA0; In a bid to make myself think creatively, I had an idea. I bought a cheap bingo set that includes a spinning lotto machine. My plan is to look up every weapon on every Hitman level, assigning each a number corresponding to the numbers in my lotto machine. At the outset of a mission, I&#x2019;ll spin the machine once for every target on the level. Whatever number falls out, that&#x2019;s the weapon I must use to eliminate that particular target, no matter how noisy, conspicuous or absurd it may be.&#xA0; For the purposes of this escapade, I&#x2019;m playing Hitman 2 with the legacy pack installed, mainly because it&#x2019;s tidier. I&#x2019;m playing the vanilla Hitman campaign in sequence with the exception of the tutorial mission. I&#x2019;ll start each mission with the same equipment, a silenced pistol, fibre wire, some coins, and whatever the default disguise is for the mission. I&#x2019;m also adding a sniper-rifle as a smuggled item, as they tend not to appear in the game.&#xA0; While I can only kill targets with the specified weapon, for non-targets I can use whatever the situation requires. I&#x2019;m also only allowed to reload a save if I die. As for the weapon list, it includes anything that can be picked up and used as a weapon in a Hitman level.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve also added &#x2018;Falling&#x2019; and &#x2018;Drowning&#x2019; to the list, as both of those can be performed on most targets. I&#x2019;m going to get out of my bad habits if it kills me. Or at least, if it kills a lot of other people. Sharp fashion It&#x2019;s Paris Fashion Week and my targets are Viktor Novikov and Dalia Margolis, who are using the show as a front for auctioning terrorist strikes. I&#x2019;m here to put an end to the bidding, permanently. Time to spin the wheel.&#xA0; The first ball to roll out of my machine is number eight. According to my list that&#x2019;s a kitchen knife, a long-standing Hitman staple that I&#x2019;ll soon be using to staple Viktor Novikov to a wall.&#xA0; The second ball is 15, a wrench. Hardly the most exciting weapon in Hitman&#x2019;s list, but it will mean getting up close and personal to Margolis, which I remember from my previous playthrough to be tricky.&#xA0; Novikov first. He&#x2019;s wandering around the show floor with a bodyguard in tow, so I&#x2019;ll need to separate the two. I also need to acquire the knife, so naturally I start looking for the kitchen. I head into the bar, where I notice event staff wandering around. I&#x2019;ll need a uniform to get into the kitchen, so I continue out into the garden finding a flight of stairs leading to the basement. Two event workers are having a smoke break at the bottom. I overhear them chatting about how Novikov&#x2019;s preferred cocktail is something called a Bareknuckle Boxer. I file this for later.&#xA0; One of the workers returns upstairs. The other walks through the door leading into the basement. I follow him and quietly knock him out, stealing his uniform and dumping his unconscious body in a crate. I wander through the underground vaults before stumbling into the kitchen. After a minute of poking around I find a kitchen knife. I also find a wrench in a storage area adjacent to the kitchen, which is nice stroke of luck.&#xA0; I head back upstairs, a plan forming in my mind. Behind the bar is a food-prep area. In the far corner is a box of rat poison. I pick one up and head to the bar, making up a Bareknuckle Boxer with one extra special mixer. Then I wait until Novikov arrives for his drink, and dash to the nearby men&#x2019;s room, hiding in a cupboard. It isn&#x2019;t long before Novikov stumbles through the door and deposits several ounces of featherweight champion into the toilet. The rest is easy. Knife. Throat. Dead. I stuff the body in the cupboard and leave. A clean job. But if I&#x2019;m honest, that&#x2019;s roughly how I offed Novikov the first time I played, only that time I drowned him in his own sick. In truth, I&#x2019;d forgotten about the bodyguard, and trying to navigate that problem threw me back into my old patterns. Hopefully Margolis will spur me into being more creative.

November Update - Release Notes The full release notes are posted on our website. Below are the PC-Specific changes. AMD FidelityFX We have added support for AMD’s FidelityFX Contrast-Adaptive Sharpening. This algorithm recovers high frequency features lost during temporal anti-aliasing to provide a rich, detailed image. All players can take advantage of this support, regardless of their choice of graphics card. This can be toggled between Off, Weak, Moderate or Strong in the ‘Graphics’ Menu. DX12 CPU Usage We have reduced CPU usage, which can improve framerates in certain CPU bound situations. In addition, GPU memory usage has been significantly reduced on NVIDIA cards. DX12 Shader Cache We have made some changes that will reduce the time it takes to launch the game on DX12, especially the first time after upgrading a graphics driver, downloading a game update or a completely fresh launch. Additional note: Since the release of the November Update on November 19th, our PC community has reported that DX12 performance has actually been reduced in some circumstances. We've been able to reproduce this at the studio and a hotfix is currently being tested. We don't have an ETA for when it will be released yet, but will share an update when we do.",1574258738,

You can also look forward to The Montague Audacity escalation contract in Santa Fortuna that day, as well as several featured contracts created by the Hitman community. November 19 will see two more Legacy Escalations, the Arthin Occultation in Bangkok and the Szilassi Darkness in Sapienza. Blake&apos;s Endeavor on the Isle of Sgail is a new challenge pack that arrives alongside these, and completing it unlocks the Arkian Tuxedo outfit for Agent 47. Two Legacy Challenge packs are also arriving on the 19th: Plumber&apos;s Apprentice and Master Sniper, both set in Sapienza. These unlock the claw hammer and Jaeger 7 Covert rifle respectively. That date will also see the release of Hitman 2&apos;s November game update, which will include various fixes and tweaks. The Fixer, a Legacy Elusive Target, will follow all this on November 22. He&apos;s a tricky fellow, and IO says he&apos;s got the lowest clear rate of all the Elusive Targets to date.&#xA0; Rounding out the month are three more Escalations: The three-stage McCallister Ransack in Whittleton Creek, the increasingly complicated Quimby Quandary on the Isle of Sgail, and the improbably-named Bartholomew Hornswaggle on Haven Island. This last one unlocks the Buccaneer outfit for 47, which includes a tricorn captain&apos;s hat and the requisite eyepatch. Even as IO ramps up production on the next Hitman game, the studio has made sure to keep current players busy. The studio will hold a livestream November 18 to talk more about what&apos;s in store for the series.

All this comes via IO's <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-november-roadmap/"" target=""_blank"">latest blogpost</a>, in which the developer outlined its November content roadmap for Hitman 2. There's a lot going, but perhaps the most significant news is that this month's update, which arrives on the 19th November and marks one year since Hitman 2's release, will be the game's ""final major patch"". That, explains IO, is because ""after 13 months of full-time support and content for Hitman 2 - at no additional cost (besides what we added through the Expansion Pass), we're now at a place where we are looking increasingly to the future.

863550,The next Hitman game is 'well under way',"Hitman 2 has been subject to countless updates since its release last November, but it looks like IO Interactive is moving most of its resources on to the next major installment in the series. In a new <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-november-roadmap/"" target=""_blank"">November roadmap</a> published today, the company said that it&apos;s &quot;looking increasingly to the future&quot;. Which means that &quot;in real terms, we&apos;re moving more and more of the Hitman 2 team to join the next Hitman game, which is well underway.&quot; This is good news for Hitman fans, who might have feared that IO Interactive&apos;s forthcoming <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/hitman-developer-io-interactive-is-working-on-a-new-game/"">non-Hitman game</a>&#x2014;which will be published by Warner Bros&#x2014;could signal a long break in Agent 47&apos;s bloody career. While the Warner Bros published game hasn&apos;t been thoroughly detailed, it did come with the sentiment that the studio wants to explore &quot;new universes, new franchises&quot;&#x2014;Hitman is neither. While Hitman 2 won&apos;t get new missions, there&apos;s still a wealth of Featured Contracts coming, as well as the addition of Community-curated Contracts. Some Seasonal Content&#x2014;the announcement doesn&apos;t specify which&#x2014;will be added to the game permanently, and there&apos;s a new Escalation and Elusive Contract coming in December. So the game is still &quot;living&quot;, in other words, but probably to a lesser extent than we&apos;ve seen throughout 2019.

863550,HITMAN 2- October Update,"Halloween is coming to HITMAN 2! Watch the latest trailer for the new content now and see the full release notes for our October Update below. HITMAN 2 October Update Release Details and Server Maintenance The October Update (aka 2.71.0) will arrive on October 22 and we expect it to be between 1.7 GB and 2 GB on consoles and 900 MB on PC. There will be server maintenance at the usual times between 11:00 and 15:00 UTC to prepare for this release. Stay tuned to the @IOInteractive Twitter page for updates. Game Update 2.71.0: What’s Changing? The Fate of Bartoli the Twelfth We have made a final resolution to the Bartoli Saga. The Bartoli 12G is an unlockable weapon in New York and will retain the properties of being concealable on Agent 47 but it can no longer be selected as a starting weapon. Instead, it will need to be placed in a stash and retrieved during a mission. We went back and forwards on this issue a few times but ultimately settled on a solution that works consistently without other issues. If you still want to experience walking into Paris and having your invitation checked whilst holding a shotgun, you’d better be quick. We recommend using the Lynch Suit for best results. Trophies and Tribulations We have addressed a community-reported issue where trophies and achievements for completing Maximum location mastery were not awarded, despite players fulfilling the requirements. Upon launching the game with the 2.71.0 update installed, players are advised to launch the mission from the menu (do not load a save) and then complete the mission fully. Location XP We have made changes that will ensure players unlock trophies and achievements for completing the maximum location mastery, even if the final XP was earned on the Patient Zero campaign missions or a Special Assignment. Sniper Suppression We’ve fixed a community-reported issue where the suppressor of the Druzhina 34 Arctic could be misplaced after a load/save cycle. Sniper Mode Menu We have made a community-requested change to the Sniper Assassin menu flow. Now, after completing a match, you will be able to return directly to the Sniper Assassin Game Mode page, making it quicker and easier to choose another map to play. Sniper Leaderboards We have made a back-end change to the Sniper Assassin leaderboards to ensure the current high scores are legitimate and put measures in place to prevent further unattainable scores. Druzhina Perk We have updated the description of the Druzhina 34 ICA Arctic to accurately describe the perks that it has. “Marksman”, “Suppressor” and “Versatile Scope” have been added. For the sake of clarity, no gameplay changes have been made to the weapon. Sniper Render We have fixed an issue in the Sniper Assassin Mode that could cause characters to appear in low resolution when viewed at the lowest zoom level. Rifle Reload We have fixed a community-reported issue in Mumbai where the Kashmirian’s rifle can disappear after a save/load cycle. Discover Paradise We have fixed a community-reported issue where some players were unable to complete the ‘Discover Haven Island’ challenge and would get stuck on 40/41. Trick or… We have fixed a community-reported issue where the Banana on Haven Island was considered an illegal item on Casual Difficulty, but not on other difficulties. Now, it will be considered illegal on all difficulties. Paradise Lockdown We have made some changes that could cause some unexpected AI behaviour during a Target Lockdown in Haven Island. What Did the Chef Say? We have fixed an issue where the Chef in Haven Island was missing subtitles for their dialogue. Haven Animation We have made several fixes to animation issues on Haven Island, including when 47 gets a massage, NPC’s typing on keyboards, guards sitting and standing and NPC’s eating food. Butler Blunder We have fixed an issue where the Butler would ask 47 to wait for Tyson Williams, even if Tyson is already in the room when 47 enters. Jetski Explosions We have fixed an issue where using explosives on an unused jetski in Haven Island would make it disappear entirely. Deck Chair Protection Incorporated We have fixed an issue where Agent 47 isn’t removed from a ‘hiding in plain sight’ (HIPS) spot on the deck chairs despite entering the combat state. Fishy Remains We have fixed an issue in Haven Island where picking up a fish would leave a invisible collision box that would impede 47’s movement. Toilet Collision We have fixed an issue where it was not possible to throw items into the toilets in the Haven Island gym and restaurant. We look forward to players now being able to fill all of the toilet bowls with all sorts of items. Upvotes inbound. ClipMan We have fixed an issue where there was severe clipping on Agent 47’s head when under the pier in Haven Island. Invisible Inflatable We have fixed an issue where the required for an easter egg exit in Haven Island could disappear after a save/load cycle. The exit cinematic or functionality wasn’t affected by the ...",1571742313,

But today it dropped a new trailer that leans very heavily into classic horror movie themes, with Agent 47 taking the role of the implacable, inhuman masked killer who&apos;s come seeking <em>revenge! </em>For... something. It might be a bit odd, but I&apos;d say that 47&apos;s Headless Hitman getup is the most normal thing about this video. Avoiding detection by wearing the stupidest outfit possible is his signature move, after all. But I feel like this goes beyond the usual costume-wearing nonsense that he employs in his day-to-day business, especially since the video portrays Hawke&apos;s Bay, the isolated New Zealand beach house from Hitman 2&apos;s tutorial level.

863550,"Seriously, why aren't you playing Hitman 2?","Today I read that Hitman 2 (the 2018 one, not Silent Assassin) sold 90% fewer copies than Hitman: Absolution, which broke my brain a little. And as I type this, only about a thousand people are playing it on Steam. Plenty of great games underperform, because sales are not a barometer of quality. Far from it. But this isn&apos;t some weird new IP or obscure indie game. It&apos;s Hitman! And not just any Hitman, but arguably the best Hitman in the series. I know what you&apos;re thinking. Blood Money is the best Hitman, right? Curtains Down, You Better Watch Out, A New Life... all classic missions. That&apos;s why I said <em>arguably</em>, because there&apos;s a condition to this rather wild statement. Hitman 2 on its own is a great game, but probably not as great as Blood Money. However, throw in the DLC that adds all the levels from the original 2016 reboot and it&apos;s probably the best Hitman experience you can have on PC. Why? Well, IO&apos;s assured Hitman reboots have deep systems that let you dream up creative ways to complete your objectives, making them supremely satisfying stealth games. Sneaking into a heavily guarded area, killing the target, making it look like an accident, then strolling out unseen, whistling a lil tune, is a sublime feeling. The AI is fun to screw around with, the levels are intricate and detailed, and it&apos;s all super polished, just like Agent 47&apos;s wonderfully shiny head. But what really elevates Hitman 2 is its exceptional level design. Along with the 2016 maps, this is probably the finest collection of stealth puzzle boxes on PC. These complex, sprawling spaces are heaving with potential for creative assassination, from the idyllic Italian coastal town of Sapienza to the wind-battered Isle of Sg&#xE0;il. Every location has its own distinctive personality, rich with systems to exploit, shortcuts to take, and details to discover. Another thing IO excels at is creating a sense of place. These levels aren&apos;t just mechanically interesting; they&apos;re also atmospheric, exotic places to spend time in. Whether it&apos;s the leafy American suburbs of Whittleton Creek, Hokkaido&apos;s ultra-high-tech mountain hospital, or the bustling slums of Mumbai, these environments are prime examples of just how good IO&apos;s artists are when it comes to building immersive, detailed worlds. The freedom is another thing I love. If you want to orchestrate your own elaborate murder, you can. The systems are deep enough. But you can also follow mission stories to gently guide you towards a solution. These are all worth doing at least once, because they let you dispose of these horrible people in an ironic, darkly satisfying manner. Ultimately it&apos;s just nice to have the choice of how involved you want to be in a hit, depending on your mood. You can read Phil&apos;s <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/hitman-2-review/"" target=""_blank"">review</a> for a more in-depth analysis of what Hitman 2 does well, but I feel it&apos;s my duty to remind you that A) this game exists and B) it&apos;s incredibly good. And with two new levels added recently&#x2014;a <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/hitman-2s-new-high-security-bank-is-a-joy-to-break-into/"" target=""_blank"">bank in New York</a> and a tropical island in the Maldives&#x2014;it&apos;s only gotten better since it launched.

Then, on October 11, the Warlord will be returning in the month&apos;s only Legacy Elusive Target. The spooky shenanigans finally begin on October 17, when IO will show off this month&apos;s community-created contracts, all with a trick or treat theme. Submissions for the contracts ends on October 14. The Halloween Escalation Contract, coming on October 22, is still a mystery, but players are promised two rewards. You&apos;ll be able to take it for a spin whenever you want, too, as it will be a permanent fixture. On the same day, Legacy Challenge Packs will slip into Hitman 2, giving owners of the Legacy Pack a trio of challenges to complete, each of them unlocking an outfit and weapon. Complete them all and Agent 47 will have everything he needs if someone finally invites him to a Halloween party. October 25&apos;s Elusive Target is a serial killer in Whittleton Creek, followed by the chance to becoming a slasher movie villain in the Hawke&apos;s Bay challenge pack on October 31. Hokkaido and Sapienza Legacy Escalations will be appearing on the same day, if you&apos;ve got a hankering to relive two of the last game&apos;s best missions.&#xA0; Expect more details about the Halloween Escalation Contract during IO&apos;s livestream on October 21, the day before the mission appears.

863550,Hitman 2's new high security bank is a joy to break into,"There&apos;s something special about bank levels. Whenever a stealth game or an immersive sim asks me to sneak into a bank of any description, I find it hugely exciting. Walking into the gleaming marble lobby, taking a mental note of the armed guards, security cameras, bulletproof glass, and laser grids. Looking for holes in the security that I can exploit. Vents to creep into, keycards to pickpocket, loot to snaffle. Then pulling off the perfect heist without being seen or heard by anyone and strolling casually out of the front door. A bank level is a puzzle, really. A seemingly impenetrable fortress you have to figure out how to infiltrate, using your imagination to game the systems, cleverly navigate the level, and outsmart the AI. The Palisade Bank in Eidos-Montr&#xE9;al&apos;s Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a recent example of a great bank level, being a colossal, monolithic citadel filled with sensitive data to steal, complex, interlinked security systems to bypass, and heavily armed guards to outwit. Much of this level is optional, but spending time there is enormously entertaining. Back in 2017 I <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/making-deus-ex-mankind-divideds-best-level-the-palisade-bank/"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> Cl&#xE9;mence Maurer, lead designer on the Palisade Bank map, for a making of feature. In the interview she described the level she designed as a &quot;tough, rich, and super dense map&quot; where players are given all the tools they need to infiltrate it, but never a way how. &quot;The bank rewards smart, adventurous players who explore every corner of the map,&quot; she says. &quot;The pieces of the puzzle are not meant to be given away, but earned.&quot; <a target=""_blank""> </a> And that&apos;s a big part of why I love bank levels like this. Those moments when you&apos;re standing back, hiding in the shadows, or even in plain sight, and just figuring the thing out. Observing the guards, studying their patrols, and looking for interesting ways to navigate the environment. In a lot of cases you can just brute-force your way in, but for me the best bank levels really shine when you slip in and out unseen and unheard&#x2014;doubly so if you&apos;ve managed to fill your pockets with loot, because why infiltrate a bank and not take anything? These levels are also appealing to me in the same way heist movies are. A period of meticulous planning leading up to the big caper in the final act, and that simmering tension of whether the plan will work or not. Except, in the case of videogames, this feeling is more pronounced because you&apos;re the one actually doing the job. The heists in games like Payday and Grand Theft Auto V are dramatic and undoubtedly loads of fun, but I prefer it when staging the crime is left entirely up to me, rather than prescribed by a developer. A grand, temple-like financial hub catering to the city's elite I spent hours gutting every corner of the Palisade Bank. Opening every safe, rifling through every desk, and hacking every computer. And when I slowly strolled back out to the streets of Prague through the lobby, the security staff oblivious to my crimes, it felt amazing. Immersive sims always turn me into a terrible kleptomaniac, and I guess this loot-stuffed map is the natural conclusion of that style of play. And let&apos;s be honest, it&apos;s just fun to steal things in games and get away with it. Which leads me to the latest level released for Hitman 2. This new assassination, titled Golden Handshake, takes place in the New York branch of the Milton-Fitzpatrick Investment Bank: a grand, temple-like financial hub catering to the city&apos;s elite. It&apos;s the perfect setting for a Hitman level, with tight security, a target whose every move is shadowed by a team of guards, and IO Interactive&apos;s usual high standards of atmosphere, world-building, and architecture. <a target=""_blank""> </a> Grand Central Station seems to have inspired the bank&apos;s lavish, ostentatious architecture, with shafts of light streaming through tall glass windows. The sense of scale in the main hall is dizzying, and I like how Miltzon-Fitzpatrick has augmented the old building with modern elements. Dotted around the lobby are modern metal cubes containing meeting rooms, lit by the old chandeliers above. IO is particularly good at this kind of spatial contrast: see also, the glass structure sitting atop the crumbling stone castle in the Isle of Sg&#xE0;il map. But the real meat of the level is found in the basement, where the vault is housed. You can actually get into the vault area without a disguise, as long as you don&apos;t have any illegal items on you. Here you can access the private lockboxes, a few of which can be lock-picked to find some interesting items. But to access the room where the imposing vault door is, you&apos;ll need to disguise yourself as an elite security guard and find a keycard. And even then there are several other steps required to actually get into the vault itself. On the upper floors of the bank you'll find a bustling stock exchange On the upper floors of the bank you&apos;ll find a bustling stock exchan...",1568129610,
863550,Hitman 2 s September roadmap sends Agent 47 to The Maldives,"It&#x2019;s time that Agent 47 had a break from the assassin life. But unfortunately, his superiors have other arrangements. &#xA0;In <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-september-roadmap/"" target=""_blank"">this month&apos;s Hitman 2 roadmap</a>, Agent 47 is jetting off to Haven Island, a tropical sun-soaked resort in The Maldives. But there&#x2019;s no time for pina coladas, there are plenty of new missions that run from the beginning to the end of September that include new targets, unlocks, and missions.&#xA0; Kicking off September were two escalation contracts that have already been released. The Dalton Dissection contract will have Agent 47 return the New York bank to take out some new targets wearing his cutest disguise to date, the bank robber disguise with bonus bunny mask. The second contract, The Covert Dispersal, challenges Agent 47 to crash a quaint garden party by eliminating the undercover officers. Next on the roadmap is the Dubious Cohabitation contract available on September 12 and has our undercover agent seek out an old assassin friend. If the mission goes to plan and your long-range skills are on point then Agent 47 will be walking away in a lavish cashmerian suit. On September 13, the first Legacy Elusive Target of this month is The Blackmailer. The target will be walking the catwalks of Paris and Agent 47 will need to take him out and retrieve a secret memory stick. Another escalation contract will be added on September 19 called the Merele Revelation which has Agent 47 infiltrate a cult disguised as a Shaman. Upon completing this contract you&#x2019;ll unlock the Emetic Grenade that makes enemies vomit. September 24 is when Haven Island will be available for expansion pass owners. Alongside the sunny resort are two expansion pass exclusive Special Assignments, the Bitter Pill and A Silver Tongue, the perfect holiday package.&#xA0; Then finally, another Legacy Elusive target is added on September 27 named The Angel of Death. Agent 47 returns to Marrakesh to take out an old retired nurse. You&#x2019;ll be up against the clock with 10 days to take her down.&#xA0; IO Interactive will also be adding featured contracts, game updates and a live stream as the month progresses. With two contracts out already and the next one releasing September 12 it seems like the Summer holidays are over for Agent 47, maybe the Christmas holidays will be more relaxing. ",1567860868,
863550,HITMAN 2 – August Update 2.60.0,"August in HITMAN 2 brings another content drop for Expansion Pass owners, adding the Smart Casual suit and 2 new items to Agent 47’s inventory. All HITMAN 2 owners will also get a host of quality-of-life improvements for various aspects of the game and numerous fixes and tweaks in this month’s update. Read the the full Patch Notes here: ______________________________________________ Game Update 2.60.0: What’s Changing? Sniper Chamber Reload Speed We’ve added a visual indicator for all Sniper Rifles (when scoped) to indicate how long it will take Agent 47 to add another bullet to the chamber (or the time it will take before you can fire another shot). This will be only be visible for Sniper Rifles but on both Sniper Assassin maps and campaign/sandbox missions. A similar indicator will also be visible to show the time for a full reload. In the image below, you can see the ‘chamber load progression’ in the bottom right-hand third of the scope, as well as how many bullets are left in the magazine before you need to reload. The image also includes some subtle hints to an upcoming Expansion Pass location, currently known only as ‘The Resort’. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32937893/939a4760a485c7c1de7b04601bcbb7fb2b9a4270.png Sniper Assassin SA We’ve made a change to ensure that the ‘Sniper Assassin‘ challenge is unlocked when completing the necessary requirements and earning the SA rating. The SA rating is awarded even if a target spots 47 before they can share that knowledge, however this logic was not applied to the ‘Sniper Assassin‘ challenges. This meant that it was possible to earn the SA rating but not unlock the Sniper Assassin challenge. Not That Fast We’ve made a change to when the ‘Exit Mission’ prompt becomes available, as a follow-up to a change we made in April. After eliminating the final target, there will now be a 3-second delay until the ‘Exit Mission’ prompt appears and players can exit. No Evidence We’ve fixed an issue where the ‘No Evidence‘ challenge does not unlock if either; the body of a sedated NPC is found, or if a target finds a pacified/killed body – even if 47 kills the target before they share that knowledge. Tag Team When viewing items in the in-game inventory, we have simplified the tags. Instead of each item reading ‘Non-lethal melee’ AND ‘Non-lethal throw’, it will now have a single ‘Non-lethal’ tag. Same change for ‘Lethal’ items too. Frisk Detection When viewing your in-game inventory, we have removed the ‘Detected During Frisk’ tag, since it is no longer possible to get frisked with an illegal item in your inventory. Instead, we will now display a ‘Not Detected During Frisk’ tag on relevant items. This change will make those items easier to identify and remove redundant tags from many illegal items. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/32937893/3ebbb2ea9aecf78df974d02719d69c1b9a4bce5a.png ______________________________________________ PC-Specific Fixes Contract Crash We’ve fixed an issue that could cause players with low-end Nvidia cards to encounter a crash when attempting to launch a contract. DX12 Stability We have improved stability when using DX12 on Nvidia graphic cards. GPU Memory Usage The Options>Graphics menu now displays GPU memory usage on DX12. Category Navigation Shortcuts We’ve added shortcuts for navigating between weapon and gear categories (pistol/shotgun, melee/explosives, etc) and challenges (feats/assassination/classics, etc). We’ve added two options: Use Home and End / Q and E to navigate left and right. (Note that these shortcuts will not have in-game prompts, so feel free to make a “PSA” thread on Reddit to share the word and we’ll give it some gold.) ______________________________________________ Read the the full Patch Notes here:",1566985517,

We’ve got hot Challenge Packs, Featured Contracts, a Legacy Elusive Target, Escalation Contracts and more! All wrapped in this month’s theme “Jungle Music” (previously known as ‘Jungle Summer’) After all that music, you’ll need a silent retreat, therefore we’re also stepping a bit out of the theme this month and going to one of the coldest and harshest environments on the planet far away from music and jungle summer vibes on July 30th with the release of The Prison; a new Sniper Assassin map that is coming to all owners of the HITMAN 2 Expansion Pass.

863550,Hitman 2's July roadmap targets musicians,"<a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/hitman-2/"" target=""_blank"">Hitman 2</a> is preparing for a hot, loud summer full of killer musicians and killing musicians, kicking off tomorrow, July 4, with The Babayeva Dissonance. It&apos;s an escalation contract where you&apos;ll be blowing up a noisy band on the Isle of Sgail. Agent 47 apparently doesn&apos;t appreciate a good tune.&#xA0; On July 4, Agent 47&#x2014;no doubt wracked with guilt over the last contract&#x2014;will try to make amends by joining a band himself. The &apos;I&apos;m with the Band&apos; challenge pack will make you the newest member of the Santa Fortuna band and give you five band-related challenges to complete. Success means you get your very own violin.&#xA0; July 18&apos;s featured contracts will carry on the musical theme, with Io asking for submissions that fit the theme of &apos;tone death&apos;. You&apos;ve got until July 15 to submit your entry, and the best of the bunch will appear a few days later. The next day, you&apos;ll also get another crack at the Badboy elusive target, but you&apos;ll need to the Legacy Pack if you want to give it a shot.&#xA0; Another escalation contract will appear on July 25, sending you back to Santa Fortuna to blow more stuff up. Completing the Calvino Cacophony escalation with net you the Hot Summer Suit, which makes Agent 47 look like a serial killer on his holiday. It suits him.&#xA0; Finally, on July 30 Hawke&apos;s Bay will be added to contract mode, and anyone with a free IOI account will get a trio of anniversary outfits. If you&apos;ve got the expansion pass, you&apos;ll also get the second Sniper Assassin map, sending you to an extremely chilly prison. Mastering this map will unlock the Druzhina 34 ICA Arctic sniper rifle. A game update will drop on the same day.&#xA0; Busy July for assassins, then. Do assassins take holidays, I wonder, or is it just working holidays? I get it&#x2014;it&apos;s hard to escape work when your attached to your phone or, indeed, your silenced pistol.&#xA0; The first mission will appear tomorrow, July 4.&#xA0; ",1562171419,

Not change in the Smashmouth sense where the bloke earnestly asks him for some money and he responds by uselessly philosophising at him in F# major for a bit, but actual hard currency. Maybe an artisan market has popped up in the high street and they&#8217;re cash only, but he wants to buy himself some baklava. Maybe he needs a quid to play Time Crisis. Maybe I&#8217;m of a mind to test the sequence of events and player-agnostic world. There&#8217;s no way to ever know for sure. But whatever the reason is, Ian Hitman is still queuing in the bank. <strong>11:00 am:</strong> The queues are pretty short.

At least, that&#8217;s what he says in the trailer for the New York bank mission DLC coming to <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/hitman-2/"">Hitman 2</a> tomorrow. I see no reason not to believe him, as he&#8217;s very candid for a man of mystery and murder. The first full, regular mission coming to the stab-puzzle sandbox since launch, The Bank looks like a gloriously dense machine full of bustling NPCs playing out their deliciously fragile routines. While you&#8217;re there, you might as well off the bank&#8217;s director and raid the vault, I suppose.

The trailer above gives you an idea of what to expect: a heavily-guarded bank, naturally, and an introduction to the deserving target you&apos;ll be taking out, director Athena Savalas.&#xA0; This level will open up for Expansion Pass, Silver Edition and Gold Edition owners&#xA0;on PC at June 25, 6 pm BST / 10 am PT. The bank level has previously been described as a &apos;sandbox location&apos;, so it&apos;ll hopefully be comparable to Hitman 2&apos;s existing murder puzzles boxes. It&apos;ll launch with contracts mode enabled, and feature 15 levels of location mastery. &#xA0; Here&apos;s more on your target, from IO Interactive. &quot;Over the years, Savalas has also developed a refined disdain for the middle class, reducing customers to numbers on sheets of paper with no thought to the things she destroys with her constant &apos;less is more&apos; approach to small and medium-sized businesses. Rumors of wanton gambling with client money and the bank&#x2019;s finances are beginning to catch up to her and with the board of directors looking for a new CEO of Milton-Fitzpatrick, Savalas is eagerly covering her tracks, using any means necessary.&quot; A nasty banker sounds like a solid pick for a Hitman 2 target in 2019.&#xA0; If you&apos;re interested in more details about how the bank was made, IO Interactive ran a livestream today explaining the bank&apos;s creation. I&apos;ve embedded that below for your convenience. How big is too big, when you&apos;re making a bank level? That&apos;s among the subjects discussed in detail.

IO Interactive finally added support March, which has boosted frame rates on higher-end systems, and the studio is working to make it better on low-end rigs, it said this week. In a <a href=""https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx-12-boosts-performance-of-hitman-2/"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft blog post</a>, the dev team said that users were reporting improved performance since DX12 support was added, and internal testing had showed an 43% improvement in frame rates. However, that data was gathered on a six-core Haswell CPU and AMD Fury X GPU&#x2014;with lower-end systems, DX11 still offers better performance, and IO wants to change that. &quot;DirectX 12 requires additional work on the part of the game, so in some cases the overhead of this may result in poorer performance compared to the DirectX 11 version,&quot; it said. &quot;We are still optimizing our DirectX 12 implementation and we expect to see improved performance on additional configurations, but currently DirectX 11 may be the best option for players with less capable systems.&quot; It didn&apos;t say when we can expect better performance on lower-end machines, but I&apos;d expect that it&apos;ll come as the team receive more feedback from players.

Ghost Mode Location: Santa Fortuna Our second location for Ghost Mode is Santa Fortuna. Welcome to the jungle. ______________________________________________ Ghost Mode: Emotes We’ve added 4 new emotes that can be activated in Ghost Mode. How Gracious – For those moments when a kiss speaks louder than words Well Done – A slightly ironic clapping gesture aimed at your opponent Evil Eye – Let your opponent understand they’re under severe scrutiny Disbelief – Show appreciation of your opponent’s actions by shaking your head Ghost Mode: Items We’ve added 4 new items to Ghost Mode. Pick them up in Ghost Crates. The Ghost Freeze Grenade will slow down your opponent for a short amount of time. The Ghost Outfit Manipulator will simultaneously change both your and your opponents outfit to a new random one. The Ghost Proximity Explosive will trigger in your opponents world if they come near it. The Ghost Flash Grenade will blind and disorientate your opponent. Ghost Mode: Phantom We’ve added the ‘Phantom Assassin’ Challenge to Ghost Mode. Complete it by eliminating 100 targets in Ghost Mode (any location) and unlock the Phantom Suit. Ghost Mode: Target Variation We’ve added 4 new variations of the Ghost Mode target, for a total of 5. Whilst keeping the same visual style, the targets will now have more variation in their appearance. It doesn’t matter what they look like if you want to unlock the Phantom Suit though, just eliminate 100. Ghost Mode: Rematch We’ve added the option to immediately go into a rematch with the same opponent. Silent Assassin Scoring We’ve implemented new and finalised rules for earning the Silent Assassin rating. Our goals for this rating is to keep it as the pinnacle accomplishment for the game, where earning 5 stars and the highest possible score was something to aspire to and difficult to achieve. The mission scoring will now be calculated based on these parameters; Objectives Complete (20k), Never Spotted (20k), No Noticed Kills (20k), No Bodies Found (20k), No Recordings (20k), Non-Target Kill Penalty (0), Time Bonus. To earn the Silent Assassin rating in any mission, players will need to complete all objectives and exit the mission, without any of the following 7 events occurring: 1. An NPC escalates to the Compromised state. 2. An NPC escalates to the Suspicious state. 3. An NPC catches Agent 47 trespassing. 4. An NPC finds a dead or pacified body. (Accident kills and poision kills do not fail this event) 5. Agent 47 is spotted performing an illegal or suspicious action through a camera by an NPC. (If there is no guard watching the camera feed, 47 will get recorded but can still earn the SA rating by destroying the evidence.) 6. Getting recorded by a security camera and failing to destroy the evidence. 7. Agent 47 kills a non-target. Additional: For events 1-5, if the NPC that triggers the event is a target (and no other non-targets trigger the same event or gains knowledge from the target), the SA rating will be retained on mission end. Silent Assassin Tracker Keep track of your status towards the Silent Assassin rating during gameplay. The tracker will display as an icon next to the mini map and the colour will show whether SA will currently be awarded for the playthrough. In cases where SA is not currently achievable but could be later on, for example if Agent 47 was recorded by a security camera, the tracker will display as red and then turn to green once the evidence has been deleted.

I wonder if you visit them in that order. In a post on <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-2019-content-highlights/"" target=""_blank"">IO Interactive's website</a>, the developer detailed the game's content plans for the upcoming year. This includes new sniper maps, the new locations, special assignment missions and unlockable items such as a flamingo costume. Each of the new locations will add ""new targets, challenges and mastery unlocks that can be used in all locations"". Silver players get access to sniper map Hantu Port and The Bank, but you'll need gold to try out The Prison or The Resort. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-11-hitman-2s-getting-a-bank-prison-and-resort"">Read more</a> ",1554996998,

Today, as IO Interactive revealed the roadmap for its Hitman 2 content coming later this year, it revealed the two new locations coming to the game as part of the more expensive editions of the game: The Bank and The Resort. Gold edition players get both, while Silver edition owners get The Bank. Nothing more is said about them, but a bank level <em>has</em> to have an option to stage a heist, right? The Bank is scheduled to arrive this summer, while The Resort is arriving during the Fall. Also coming are freebies for all Hitman 2 players, including new themes for an existing in-game location.&#xA0; In the fall, meanwhile, a new prison-themed sniper map will be added to the game for Gold players. Free players get a new outfit, an antique knife, Ghost Mode for Mumbai, and a couple of new themes.&#xA0; For most players, I imagine the two new locations will be the centrepiece of all of this&#x2014;I can&apos;t wait to see what IO has been up to since Hitman 2 launched last year.
