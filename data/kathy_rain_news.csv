Given Kathy Rain’s 92% positive rating on Steam, we’re inclined to think that her story resonated pretty deeply with the people who spent time with her. So with that in mind, we decided to give Kathy the chance to be experienced by a wider audience despite its initial hardships when it released in May. Kathy heads to both Android and iOS for $4.99 USD next week and we’re eager to share her raw and personal journey with the masses.

All the big names from the 90s heyday leapt into action, but unfortunately (in hindsight) they all did it via Kickstarter.

370910,Kathy Rain and the measure of success,"Hello friends. Go grab a drink of your choice, sit back, relax, and prepare for a ton of words. Raw Fury Games (the publisher of Kathy Rain) believes in being as open as possible with how we do what we do. We wouldn't be able to do any of this without you, after all. In case you missed it, we wrote a blog about Kathy Rain. It's a long read, but worth your time. Seriously, I came from the press side before joining Raw Fury and this is one of the most open things I've ever read about how a studio works: http://rawfury.com/the-measure-of-success/]The Measure of Success The long and short of it is that while Kathy Rain was a critical success, it wasn't a financial success. Our focus isn't about getting all them dollar dollar bills. Our first and foremost focus is about getting great games out there. Money of course helps, but usually in these cases a developer like Clifftop Games would have been shut down. This is typically called the ""Developer's Valley of Death."" In this case though, it's not going to happen. We're going to continue funding Clifftop Games for the next 12 months or until the revenues generated by Kathy Rain have reached a point where we have recovered our total investment and the shared royalties can sustain the development studio. Right now as of this posting we have a 94% approval rate with user reviews on Steam. That's AWESOME. Seriously, between that and all the great scores on Metacritic we're just blown away by the warm reception. If you haven't reviewed the game yet it would help us out a ton if you could. We'd love it if you helped spread the word about Kathy Rain too, but only if you wanted to. Every little bit helps, but either way we're all so grateful you played (and hopefully enjoyed!) our little game. The point & click genre is far and few between these days, but thanks to studios like Telltale, Dontnod, The Odd Gentleman, and of course, Clifftop Games, we're seeing a nice resurgence. >:)",1464737124,
370910,Kathy Rain v.1.0.2 patch up!,"Changelog: Tapes should now always translate correctly after loading savegames, preventing a potential showstopper when playing in German or French. Fixed a rare glitch state for the dictaphone which could cause the game to get stuck. Took care of a showstopper when leaving the room with the safe numpad UI still open. Shortened the speech clips of a character in the final chapter of the game, they were unnecessarily long. Kathy can no longer step on the kid in the cemetery. The label next to the checkbox in the options should no longer change to ""New label"" when loading some savegames.
