People at the studio are apparently playing early versions of the game, and from the sounds of it, they’re having fun. While the game’s no doubt still ages away from actually, you know, being a thing the rest of us can play, it’s nice to actually hear things about it from Bethesda. After all, it took about 5 years for us to actually have it <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-development-has-started"">confirmed by the now retired Pete Hines that the game was actually in early development</a>, following its <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/elder-scrolls-6-e3-2018"">announcement at E3 2018</a>, via a teaser that feels a bit like we all dreamed it at this point. This latest update came within a nice message from Bethesda commemorating The Elder Scrolls’ 30th birthday, with today, March 25, being the same date that The Elder Scrolls: Arena released on way back in 1994. After running down how much TES has grown and evolved over that time, as well as impacted loads of fans and developers, the studio touched on what it’s currently got going on with the series and what’s in the works for the future. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/elder-scrolls-6-early-builds-being-played-bethesda?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1711380752,

Well, it still isn’t, despite a Twitter post from Bethesda having managed to give a few people who struggle with reading minor heart attacks. Yes. Now, calm down. It’s not our fault that a lot of folks on social media are on tenterhooks about Xbox games possibly coming to PS5 and Switch, with the likes of <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/games/pentiment"">Pentiment</a> and <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/games/hi-fi-rush"">Hi-Fi Rush</a> <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/pentiment-hi-fi-rush-physical-versions-limited-run"">just having actually made the leap onto one or both of those machines</a>. So, what actually happened here? Well, Bethesda Game Studios put out a nice little tweet last night letting folks know that it’d just updated the Nintendo Switch version of Skyrim and casually pointing those who fancied reading through the full notes towards its official Discord server. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/starfield-not-coming-to-switch-skyrim-update-gaffe?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1709293962,
