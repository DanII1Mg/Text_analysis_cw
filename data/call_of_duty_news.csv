In a ruthless coup, Dorne casts Kagan aside forever, claiming the throne and reshaping tThe Guild’s destiny. His vision is merciless: capture David Mason at all costs and unlock the secrets buried within the C-Link, the cutting-edge neural tech possessed only by JSOC’s elite. This is more than revenge. It’s the dawn of a new era, forged in blood and ambition. Season 01 RoadmapGet ready for the biggest Season 01 ever, including new free and premium content when Call of Duty®: Black Ops 7 Season 01 goes live on Thursday, December 4 at 9AM PT across all platforms.  Black Ops 7: Season 01 Endgame Content  ENDGAME CONTENT SUMMARYEndgame is Open: Endgame and the vast Avalon map is now instantly accessible to all Black Ops 7 players as of November 21! New Word Events: Take on multiple new Endgame World Events across Avalon. Face down a giant Zombies-inspired robot, fight off hallucinations near a neurotoxin outbreak, and in the Mid-Season, engage in combat with an advanced VTOL manifested by fear. New Skills: Power up with eight new Exotic Skills earned by completing World Events; choose to strike with a deadly melee punch, resurrect yourself, or deal devastating critical damage in a variety of ways! Then during the Mid-Season, obtain access to the all-new Phantom Skill Track. CODMAS in Endgame: Avalon gets festive with the arrival of CODMAS in Endgame, bringing snowballs and giftwrapped Supply Boxes into play.   Endgame Intensifies: New World Events and More With Endgame now instantly accessible and available to all Black Ops 7 players, it’s time to team up, drop into Avalon, and explore this massive new landscape, complete objectives, increase your power, unlock unique Weapon Camos, and take on new threats! Keep pushing into escalating zones of difficulty, calling on other squads to assist if the challenges are too great. Then be sure to exfil safely to maintain your Combat Rating and live another day. Avalon Rampage: Four Endgame World Events (Launch, In-Season, Mid-Season)You’ll need to face down threats and build up your Operators’ Combat Rating, Skills, and Abilities, as Season 01 brings four multi-stage Events into the mix to challenge players. You’re advised to be at least Combat Rating 45, call up your squad, and bring your highest Rarity Weapons to the fight. Exotic Weapons will certainly help to turn the tide of battle!  World Event: Colossus of Avalon (Launch Window)Recommended CR: 45 or higher A giant mechanical contraption towers over the Avalon terrain, leaving a bloody path in its wake. Expect an emergency announcement breaking into your comms to alert all Operators within the Avalon combat zones to converge on this massive metal threat. Consult your Tac-map for the expected arrival area, and once certain criteria are met, you can watch the terrifying titan fall from the skies, visible across most of the map. To claim the bounty of rewards on offer for defeating this behemoth, you may need reinforcements outside of your own squad. Tool up, study the giant for weaknesses, expose its core, and take it out! Fail, and the Colossus will blast off into orbit, so don’t delay in your aggression. Operator Advice: Toppling this colossus will be tough, and smaller robotic enemies are likely to be encountered, so you may wish to think about equipping Black Hat (Minor Ability) or Abilities that assist in your evasion or movement capabilities. As always, Crash Cart (Major Ability) will be an excellent choice to keep you and your squad upright in the battle to come! World Event: Toxic Tyrant (In-Season)Recommended CR: 45 or higher Initial Comms suggest a second major threat to Operators within the Avalon theater of combat: In an event codenamed “Toxic Tyrant,” the emergency alert system breaks into your usual combat chatter to warn you of a severe neurotoxin outbreak occurring in Avalon. Stemming the outbreak requires your top-tier team talent and weaponry, as the enemies spilling out of these fear-based summoning anomalies are powerful and unrelenting. With time running out, you’ll need to focus on finding the source of this terror and try not to lose your mind entirely when facing the final, large-scale threat let loose by this hallucinatory biological weapon.  Additional World Events: Wraith Wing (Mid-Season)Recommended CR: 45 or higher The challenges in Endgame ...",1764787768,['workshop']

1938090,Ready for Launch: Black Ops 7 Co-op Campaign Endgame,"Yesterday, we walked you through the Story So Far. Today, it’s time to dig into Co-Op Campaign Endgame, the replayable Campaign Mode that’s much more than an epilogue; filled with challenges where JSOC continues their incursions into Avalon following the conclusion of the first 11 missions. Let’s begin with a Dev Talk on the subject:  Campaign Endgame: Initial Access After completing the first 11 Co-op Campaign missions, players will unlock Endgame, tasking JSOC with exploring the vast landscapes of Avalon, exploring The Guild’s remaining Command Centers while battling exposure zones leaking a mysterious toxin into the city. Designed for 1–32 players in squads of up to four, Endgame offers near-endless replayability as players fight through escalating zones across this massive map, level up unique Skill Tracks and Combat Ratings, complete dynamic Assignments and escape to preserve hard-earned progress. All the while, continuing the main Player Progression and Weapon Leveling, as well as unlocking specific Camos for all 30 launch weapons. In it Together: How Endgame PvE Works  In Endgame, every player works together during their deployment in Avalon. Squads can split off to pursue their own objectives or fight alongside others to improve the odds in tough fights, an especially useful tactic when approaching the area’s more dangerous zones, as shown above in the Avalon Tac-Map. In short, you choose an Operator, customize your Loadout and then drop into Avalon using a wingsuit for navigation, exploring the vast landscape on foot or in vehicle, face down threats across Avalon, then ideally exfil after completion a variety of missions. Before you Drop: The Endgame Journey Begins Your C-Link operating system unlocks full Loadout customization in the Endgame, giving each Operator the ability to choose their preferred tools for the fights ahead. Your ultimate goal is to gain enough power to reach the higher exposure zones, where something is leaking massive amounts of toxin into Avalon from there, and it’s waiting for you. Loadout Weapons and Acquisitions  You begin by choosing one of the four available Operator Slots, selecting your Operator (from up to 24 of the available Operators). Each slot (shown in the top-right corner of the above menu image) represents a character on a unique power journey. Next, you choose a Loadout. Endgame Loadouts (seen along the left of this menu) consist of a Main Weapon, a Melee Weapon, a Field Acquisition (a weapon you’ve found in a previous Endgame match and exfilled with), and a piece of Field Equipment. Explore further into Avalon to uncover Workbenches found across the province to upgrade your weapon’s rarity, which boosts its damage.  Essential Endgame Planning: Choosing Abilities Once you select an Operator for your slot and customize your Loadout, you make perhaps the most important decision of all: Your Major and a Minor ability.·       These abilities are vital to your survival in the Endgame, and you can make a concise choice of how you want to play Endgame, including the way you fight, support your teammates, and explore the landscape of Avalon.·       For example, players selecting the “Active Camo” ability are likely to favor approaching combat environments with a degree of stealth or deem it most important to easily extricate themselves from combat. Conversely, players picking “War Machine” are likely to lean into destruction and assault playstyles when battling the enemy. The choice is entirely up to you. Power up in-game to level your Combat Rating, earning new Skills and Power Upgrades across Health, Armor, Speed, and Damage, but be warned: If you’re killed in action, you lose it all. As detailed above, when creating a Loadout, players choose one Major and one Minor Ability for their Operator. The importance of these abilities cannot be understated: These grant new moves, allow the use of powerful weapons, also give unique tactical advantages, have a brief cooldown between charges, and define each Operator’s unique playstyle. As you progress through Endgame, it’s worth considering the Major and Minor Abilities available to you: Major Abilities ·       Ballistic Shell: Deploy an energy shield that blocks incoming enemy fire.·       Active Camo: Become nearly invisible for a short duration. Gunfire temporarily reveals your position.·       Hand Cannon: Powerful high-damage handgun. Accurate at range.·       Crash Cart: Instantly revive downed squadmates within range and provide temporary invulnerability. Can be used to self-revive when downed.·       Vision Pulse: Send out a pulse which visually tags enemies through walls for your squad. Tagged enemies take increased damage.·       War Machine: Powerful single shot grenade launcher. Large explosion radius.·       Shadow Break: Create an energy warping field that teleports and damages enemies.·       Drone Pod: Deployable device that launches aerial drones. Drones seek out enemies and explode. Minor Abilities ·       ...",1762884486,

1938090,Call of Duty | Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies Beta — Early Access Live!,"Welcome to the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies Beta! It’s time to jump into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies Survival Beta! Whether you’ve played Black Ops in the past or it’s your first time with a Call of Duty game, this guide will take you through everything related to the Beta, including a full list of what you’ll unlock along with links to our guides for the various maps, modes, and more! The Black Ops 7 Beta takes place Oct. 2–8, with more maps and modes being introduced throughout the play period. Keep this Blog page bookmarked for all the intel on additional maps, modes, and progression releasing throughout the Beta. Training and Brief Training Course Learn the basics, including the updated Omnimovement and firing systems as well as other Black Ops 7 combat innovations in the Training Course on the Multiplayer Map The Forge. Found alongside the other Beta modes, the training course is available, and the skills learned here should get you trained up and ready to take on the competition. It’s recommended to start your Multiplayer journey here whether you’re a new or returning player. Get down the fundamentals and dominate the opposition. Zombies Survival Training To learn the basics about Zombies and prepare for getting into Survival on Vandorn Farm, be sure to check out the Zombies Intel Blast and eliminate the zombie hordes. This Survival Map takes place on a small piece of the full Ashes of the Damned experience and allows players to explore a taste of the features that Black Ops 7 Zombies has to offer. Get a glimpse of what you will see on November 14 and how the weapons, Perks, Ammo Mods, Equipment, and Field Upgrades all feel against the shambling undead. Survival Mode: Basic Training In Survival, you (and optionally your teammates) venture within the perimeter of a map — in this case, the farmstead — and hold out for as long as possible. There are fewer places to run, Ol’ Tessie is out of commission, and tactical positioning is the key to keeping the undead forces at bay.·       Once the power to the farm has been restored, you have a focused plan: to survive for as long as possible, but with little chance of escape!·       Any accessible caches and machines available in Standard Mode appear in an identical location in Survival Mode.·       Any other interactive Crafting Tables, Wall Buys, or machines not in the Standard Mode area of the map are moved into the Survival map, allowing you to be fully tooled up, provided you’ve got the necessary Essence and Salvage.o  For example, in Standard Mode, Vandorn Farm doesn’t have a Pack-a-Punch or Der Wunderfizz machine, so both are dropped into the Survival Mode map.In Survival, your options are clear: fight for as many Rounds as you can, judging the best time to flee via Exfil before you’re overwhelmed by the dead! For more information and a complete map guide to Vandorn Farm Survival, keep reading this blog! GobbleGums Here’s something to chew on: A special selection of Beta-only GobbleGums will be available to use during the Zombies Survival portion of the Beta, which begins on October 3 and will be available for a limited time. The GobbleGums that are accessible to players during this time will not affect GobbleGum inventories outside of the Beta. They are complimentary and given to players only for the duration of the Beta (so use them or lose them at the end of the Beta!), for the purposes of trying them out in Zombies Survival and getting a feel for what they can do in this mode. To learn more about what each GobbleGum does, refer back to the GobbleGums guide for further details. Here are the GobbleGums available during the beta period: Power Vacuum (New to BO7, Epic)Kills have a higher chance to spawn Power-Ups. Nowhere But There (Epic)Instantly teleport to a random downed player. Instantly revive nearby players. Profit Sharing (Epic)(Lasts 2 Minutes) A portion of the Essence you earn is also received by nearby players and vice versa. Soda Fountain (Epic)(Activates on Perk purchase) The next Perk purchased gives an additional random Perk. Dead Drop (Epic)(Lasts 5 Minutes) Drop rates of Salvage and Equipment are greatly increased. Explosive Flourish (Epic)(Lasts 2 Minutes) Reloading creates an explosion around you. Respin Cycle (Epic)Re-spins the weapon in the Mystery Box after it has settled to one of equal or higher rarity. Round Off (New to BO7, Legendary)Prevent rounds from advancing for two rounds. Immolation Liquidation (Legendary)Spawns a Fire Sale Power-Up. Flavor Hex (Legendary)Gives the player a random Ultra GobbleGum. Gift Card (New to BO7, Ultra)Gain 30,000 Essence.

1938090,Black Ops 7 Zombies: Meet the Expanded Team. And a New Greater Evil.,"“Welcome to the Party…” After a tumultuous battle high atop of Janus Towers, celebrations are abruptly short-lived as Grigori Weaver, Dr. Elizabeth Grey, Major Mackenzie ‘Mac’ Carver, and Maya Aguinaldo are thrust into the Dark Aether dimension. The crew don’t even have the time to pick themselves up from the ground before they’re startled by the arrival of a welcoming committee. “It is a party. And y’all are the guests of honor…”A Southern drawl echoes across the lobby. All eight turn as a mysterious figure slowly descends the lobby steps, his face hidden by a wide-brimmed hat. The man’s polite turn of phrase is unnerving, but it’s the caged totem skulls he carries in each hand that suggests a much more terrifying entity has entered the fray.A skull detaches its jaw and violently expunges life force from the assembled crew, sucking essence into its maw while sharing its meal with its master, seemingly granting the mysterious figure more than a taste of their souls. Satiated, he slowly turns and leaves, but not before summoning some immediate, reanimated threats for the team to deal with. The drained crew scrambles into action, forced into a ballet of blood and guts as they slowly tear apart the undead. It’s only after the eight of them step out into what was once the Janus Towers Plaza, that a full realization becomes apparent: We’re not in West Virginia anymore. Meet the Expanded Crew  How and why are the crew transported to the Dark Aether? Who are these never-before-seen incarnations of the original Zombies crew and how did they get here? Who can be trusted? Find out in Black Ops 7 Zombies on November 14! Until then, let’s get to know all eight dedicated crew members, all over again as well as for the first time: Grigori Weaver  A Ranger-trained CIA operative, Grigori Weaver’s combat acumen and espionage know-how have carried him through countless engagements. After his mother defected from the former Soviet Union, Weaver dedicated his life to exceptional military service in clandestine operations. Haunted by tactical errors and driven by a desire to fight for something he believes in, Weaver stands strong with those who fight beside him. Weaver has been transformed by the fall of Janus Towers — no longer a shadowy spy master, he has become a hardened leader forged by sacrifice. With Requiem shattered, he gathers the broken pieces in the fight against the Dark Aether, determined to ensure his friends survive. Dr. Elizabeth GreyA highly educated and brilliant scientist, Dr. Elizabeth Grey is renowned for her groundbreaking discoveries in the study of Aetherium. However, turbulent events and sinister uses of her discoveries led her down a dark path. Transformed by years of imprisonment at the hand of the former Director of Requiem, she uses her genius and scientific mind to ensure her team maintains every tactical advantage. Grey walks away from Janus Towers with her victories tempered by a growing unease: the gnawing doubt that science may not be able to truly mend the damage it has wrought. Once a steadfast believer in reason, she now is starting to suspect that survival may demand something beyond the equations and experiments that once brought her comfort. Major Mackenzie ‘Mac’ CarverMajor Mackenzie Carver comes from a family line of military excellence and distinguished himself with exceptional skill and commitment to his country and brothers-in-arms. Despite being stripped of his rank, he maintained his mental and physical discipline throughout his incarceration, determined to restore his reputation. Carver leaves Janus Towers with his fury at the Dark Aether sharpened, reforged into a burning clarity of purpose. No longer content to follow orders, he embraces the role of protector, seeking to carve out a future where humanity can stand on its own, free of masters either mortal or cosmic in nature. Maya AguinaldoTrained in the family business of smuggling since she was a child, Maya Aguinaldo brings stealth, covert tactics, and a sharp mind to every engagement. Street smart and deadly, her effectiveness in combat comes from long years of honing her skills in infiltration, evasion, and misdirection. Her knowledge of the criminal underworld and its unorthodox tactics often comes in handy, but unfiltered opinions and acid tongue can make it hard for her to win friends. Her pursuit of the Syndicate that abducted her brother threw her into Requiem’s path when she helped free their leaders on Terminus Island. Though out of her depth in the science and machinations of the Dark Aether, her grit, grief, and hard-earned street instincts made her an essential ally in a fight far larger than her own. Uncertain of her role within her newfound ""family,"" the events at Janus Towers removed her luxury of choice, as once again she has to throw in with allies old and new if she is to have any chance of survival. Tank DempseyThis incarnation of Tank Dempsey is a battle-hardened U.S. Marine who most recently fought thro...",1758155358,
1938090,Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone Season 05 Reloaded,"Season 05 Reloaded: Incoming Intel Bring the HeatThe race to hunt down the last of the Pantheon moles is in full swing as the Rogue Black Ops team uses their renewed support by the CIA to access top-tier intel and weaponry. With Operators Troy Marshall, Frank Woods, and Russell Adler welcomed back into the halls at Langley, it’s only a matter of time before the job is finished. The action never dies as the mid-season update arrives in Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone™, bringing a new Multiplayer map, new and returning modes, new armaments, events, Reckoning Directed Mode in Zombies, and more.Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 05 Reloaded arrives on Thursday, September 4 at 9AM PT.Call of Duty: Black Ops 6: Season 05 Reloaded  MULTIPLAYER CONTENT SUMMARYNew Map: Compete to win it all in Jackpot, a new 6v6 map dropping Operators into the Casino Luttazzi. Fight in and around the ornate locale nestled in the hills of Avalon, battling on the main floor, backstage, and outside spanning vistas worth a million bucks.New and Returning Modes: Keep slaying or risk an explosive death in the Cranked Demolition LTM! Call up your squad and get ready to re-deploy to Ransack and Blueprint Gunfight.New Scorestreak: Set the enemy aflame with the new Combat Bow, a low-cost Scorestreak that detonates on impact leaving a pool of flames in its wake.  New Multiplayer Map JackpotInspired by Black Ops 4, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized Step into the Casino Luttazzi, where luxury meets chaos. Inspired by the “High Rollers” Campaign mission from Black Ops 6 and the “Casino” Multiplayer map from Black Ops 4, Jackpot sets the stage for incredible action as Operators battle over the casino floor, the dazzling Stage, and the outer Terrace and Gazebo, dripping with opulence at every turn. The stakes are sky-high, but the potential payoff is well worth the effort. Hold the central Bar for map control, trade shots between the Slots, or flank targets through the wings. Combining open combat, risky chokepoints, and multiple routes to victory, every match is a gamble, so double down, play the odds, and go all in for the win.  Multiplayer Modes Turn up the heat with the explosive Cranked Demolition mode arriving alongside two returning favorites: Ransack and Blueprint Gunfight. Cranked DemolitionNew Mode Turn up the explosive energy in this bomb-based mode as teams alternate between attacking and defending two bomb sites while managing a Cranked timer. Plant, defuse, or eliminate enemies to earn speed Perks and activate a bomb countdown on your Operator. Chain eliminations and play the objective to refresh the bomb timer and earn twice the score for your team. You can only accrue up to a max of 30 seconds on your Cranked timer at a time, so stay active in the match to refresh it as often as possible. Just don’t let that timer distract you from the ticking match clock; planting and defusing bombs are still the main objective in play! RansackReturning Mode Put it all on the line in this returning mode where teams attempt to strike it rich by looting and stashing the noblest metal of them all. Score points by looting gold bars from designated piles around the map and off fallen enemies who drop their acquired gold when eliminated. Each gold pile is activated for a limited time before moving to the next area marked on your HUD and minimap. Fill your pockets and safely return to your team’s deposit zone to score for each delivered bar; but remember that even deposited gold is up for the taking. If a player enters the opposing team’s drop site, they’ll secure gold bars directly from their stash while adding them to their own team’s score if they can get the delivery back to base in one piece. Blueprint GunfightReturning Mode Add some style to your Gunfight matches by taking on enemy duos using a variety of curated Weapon Blueprints. In each round, all four players are given the same pre-determined class. There are no respawns, so play smart, communicate with your teammate, and clutch up round after round on the way to six wins to cinch the match.  Additional Gameplay Content Unleash chaos with the new low-cost Combat Bow Scorestreak. Last seen in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, this lightweight bow comes equipped with fiery arrows that ignite on impact and create a patch of flames. New Scorestreak (MP, ZM) Scorestreak: Combat BowType: LethalScore: 500Mastery Badges: Yes Heat up the competition with the Combat Bow, providing five explosive-tipped arrows that fire fast and leave a patch of flame at the impact site.

1938090,Worldwide Reveal: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7: Initial Briefing,"BLACK OPS 7 CO-OP CAMPAIGN: CONTENT SUMMARYAn Unprecedented Campaign in Black Ops 7 dives deeper into the madness, playable solo or with up to four players.Returning Fan Favorite Characters, including David Mason and Raul Menendez, along with the introduction of new icons like Emma Kagan adds to the Campaign’s narrative intrigue.A Wide Spectrum of Environments: Take on high-stakes missions set in locations as varied as the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast, and even into the deepest corners of the human psyche. Players will also experience Avalon, an expansive city whose secrets ripple across the Campaign.Endgame Unleashed: In the culmination of the story, Treyarch and Raven are unleashing Endgame as part of the Co-Op Campaign, where Avalon opens up for players as they wield personalized abilities and face unexpected challenges, putting everything they’ve mastered throughout the story to the test. In Call of Duty®: Black Ops 7, Treyarch and Raven Software are bringing players the most mind-bending Black Ops ever. The year is 2035 and the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare following the events of Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. The calculating and dangerous Raul Menendez has returned with a chilling televised threat. As his message rings out across the world, The Guild, a global tech giant, vows to step in and protect humanity.  Seeking his own answers, David “Section” Mason leads an elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) team on a covert mission to the sprawling Mediterranean city of Avalon. While there, they uncover a weapon engineered to turn fear into an instrument of war, threatening to erode global order if released. The sophisticated plot they discover won’t just plunge the world into chaos; it will pull David Mason and his team into their own haunting pasts. As The Guild's philosophy on how to confront this crisis puts them at odds with David, he and his team must uncover the truth behind Menendez’s return and how this horrific weapon will be used to incite global terror… before losing themselves to madness. Co-Op Campaign: Full Debrief In Black Ops 7, you can go solo or squad up with up to three other players in this innovative Co-Op Campaign that redefines the Black Ops experience. This is a story that developers at Treyarch and Raven Software have been building together, designed to deepen the Black Ops universe. The world of 2035 is shaped by the consequences of choices made long before. This is a future forged by fear, where the past is never really gone. One overriding goal with the story of Black Ops 7 was to tell a story that could stand on its own while honoring the legacy of the series. Throughout development, there were meaningful opportunities allowing the reconnection of characters and storylines from earlier Black Ops titles, bringing them into this near-future setting where their presence could elevate the experience. However, it was important to ensure that even players without knowledge of Black Ops lore should expect a deeply immersive and connected story and world. Covert Missions and a Mind-Bending Narrative  In 2035, Black Ops 2 villain Raul Menendez is back with a mysterious video, threatening to burn the world down in three days. In response, The Guild, a global tech conglomerate known for its consumer innovations and military applications, has stepped into the fray to offer protection where governments and nations have failed. David Mason — call sign Section — is deployed to investigate the new danger. What he believes is a tactical operation quickly unravels into something far more dangerous and disturbing, as Mason and his “Specter One” JSOC team of elite Operators uncovers a weapon engineered to turn fear into an instrument of havoc and destruction.  After the team is exposed to the weapon, their grip on reality fractures. Missions shift into surreal landscapes, with twisted versions of each team member’s memories coming vividly into focus, and terrifying paranoia threatens to envelope them all. The line between memory and madness begins to blur. Alongside David Mason and his JSOC team comprised of Mike Harper, Eric Samuels, and Leilani ""50/50"" Tupuola, you’ll meet Emma Kagan, CEO of The Guild, and deploy with Operatives such as Slade “Razor” Barrick who heads up “Specter Two”, the secondary JSOC team supporting the overall mission. Also integral to the narrative is the enduring shadow of Raul Menendez, and as the world spirals toward chaos once more, one of the main questions of the story isn’t whether Menendez is back. It’s whether Mason is ready to face what that truly means. An Introduction to JSOC: Meet the Team David Mason  The son of legendary Black Ops operative Alex Mason, David spent his early childhood in Alaska under the shadow of his father’s extended absences and classified CIA work. This childhood was abruptly shattered in 1989, when the drug lord Raul Menendez engineered Alex Mason's ...",1755630001,
1938090,RICOCHET Anti-Cheat™ Update – Season 05,"Protecting the Call of Duty experience is #TeamRICOCHET’s highest priority. Cheating and hacking are challenges affecting all major games, and we’re fully engaged in the industry-wide fight against unfair play. Our goal is clear: to be best-in-class in anti-cheat innovation and effectiveness. It's an ongoing battle, but we’re in it for the long haul – and we’re not backing down.Thank you to every player who continues to speak up and stand against cheating. We know how deeply cheating disrupts the integrity of the game. Even when the feedback is tough, we’re listening.As part of our continued mission, we’re introducing new systems and security updates alongside Season 05 in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone that lay the groundwork for our future. These updates are targeted to strengthen our anti-cheat systems and keep your matches fun. Season 05 Spotlight:·        TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot: Strengthening game security with built-in Windows PC features·        Securing Your Account: Protect against account hijacking with email verification and 2FA features·        Game Pass Free Trial on PC: Updated policy to support fair competition in Ranked Play·        Detections Targeting Boosting and Teaming: Removing boosters and teamers from the game and leaderboards with a focus on Ranked Play integrity·        Advancing Cheat Prevention: Targeting 22 additional individuals with legal action; nearly 40 cheat vendors shutdown since launch·        Community Questions: Additional details around two new security features, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot Call of Duty Activates TPM 2.0 and Secure BootWith Season 05, Call of Duty will begin a phased rollout of two PC-based security features: TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot. TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is an industry-standard, hardware-based security feature built onto CPUs or motherboards that verifies the PC’s boot process has not been tampered with. Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.Together, these features help #TeamRICOCHET ensure that players are starting the game from a secure, cheat-free foundation.RICOCHET Anti-Cheat will focus on activating both features in the background with the upcoming season launch. We won’t be enforcing against or requiring the use of either setting during Season 05, but these features will be foundational for even stronger protections in the future. When Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releases later this year, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will be required to play on PC. These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now. This upcoming update will let us test our implementation of both features and gives you time to enable these settings. If your system isn’t ready, you’ll start seeing in-game notifications beginning this season. We’ve published a Player Support article to walk you through setup. This is your chance to stay ahead. Stronger PC security means a fairer game for everyone. Get Ready for Black Ops 7: Activate TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot Today Why TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot Matter:You’re here to play. Fairly. Competitively. RICOCHET Anti-Cheat is here to keep matches clean. TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot give us a better, more trustworthy arena to operate in. What these features do:·        Validate your PC is launching in a trusted state·        Give us the ability to verify that trusted state in a secure way·        Allow us to confirm required security features are enabled  ·        Certify only trusted software can load during Windows boot up When you play multiplayer, your PC connects to our servers to enable online play. If TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are on, Windows runs a security check at startup. The results of that check are passed to us when you connect, confirming your system hasn’t been tampered with.The final check happens on our servers, making it harder to spoof and ensuring the process is secure from start to finish. We know privacy is important to everyone, and we want to be clear: this process doesn’t give us access to your personal files or information. It only verifies that your system booted cleanly.As for performance, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will not impact in-game quality. These features perform checks during system and game startup but remain inactive while you play.We’re rolling this out carefully and monitoring everything closely. We want to strengthen security and protect the experience, without impacting performance.#TeamRICOCHET will share more details on additional protection measures we’ll be putting in place for Call of Duty as we get closer to the Black Ops 7 launch. PC Security Features of Secure Boot and TPM 2.0:Secure Boot: One of the cornerstones of PC cheating is unsigned or modified code loading during system startup. Secure Boot blocks that method. Windows will only start if it sees trusted software and drivers.·        What this means for you: Makes cheating at a hardware level much more difficu...",1754604876,

All hell breaks loose as the Rogue Black Ops team pursues one of their final targets. Wreckage and luggage litter the tarmac, flames licking the sides of the terminal and black smoke rising from the fire in the airport control tower.  Traverse the destroyed aircraft, its fuselage blasted to bits, the Plane’s nose poking through the Food Court inside.

Seek out upper vantage points to get above the action, including the infamous Silos where sharpshooters vie for their view over the east side of the map. Jackpot (Mid-Season)Inspired by Black Ops 4, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized  Deploy to the Casino Luttazzi and slot yourself into a power position for a chance to win big.

1938090,Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 confirmed,"Embrace the MadnessCall of Duty®: Black Ops 7 has been confirmed. In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Treyarch and Raven Software are bringing players the most mind-bending Black Ops ever. Developed as the next evolution of Black Ops, this is the first-ever consecutive release within the series, set more than 40 years after the events of Black Ops 6. The year is 2035 and the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare following the events of Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else. Matt Cox, General Manager of Call of Duty, talks more about the planning behind Black Ops 7’s full package of content: “The Black Ops universe is amazing. The creativity and imagination that goes into the storytelling, the rich character depth, and the incredible moment-to-moment gameplay across all modes is really exceptional. As a team, our vision from the start was to create a back-to-back series experience for our players that embraced the uniqueness of the Black Ops sub-franchise.” Prepare to squad up with friends or play solo in a thrilling and innovative Co-op Campaign, harness near-future weaponry in a signature Multiplayer experience packed with brand-new maps and descend into the next twisted chapter of Round-Based Zombies in the heart of the Dark Aether. Players have a lot to look forward to later this year when Black Ops 7 releases, Matt Cox continues: “It delivers the full Call of Duty package for our players, and we can't wait to show the community more of what the studio teams have been working on when we reveal later this summer.” Official Teaser Release The road to Black Ops 7’s reveal starts today with the Official Teaser Cinematic (shown above). Tyler Bahl, Head of Activision Publishing Marketing, provides more details: “The team is looking to build on the incredible community enthusiasm and excitement we’ve seen within the Black Ops universe. This is the first time we’re staying within the Black Ops series with back-to-back releases, so we’re excited to give players a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty®: Warzone™ before we turn the page to Black Ops 7. “Our official teaser sets the tone for players to embrace the madness that’s incoming with Black Ops 7’s story,” Bahl continues. “Delivering consecutive Black Ops games also allows our teams the tremendous opportunity to tap not only into our own creativity but also embrace the shift from a ’90s setting to the new 2035 future setting within our marketing. “Today is only the beginning with this first teaser. The full reveal of Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, so the community should be on the lookout for teases, clues and the surprises that the Black Ops series is known for. It’s an exciting time as we prepare for a new Call of Duty reveal, and the next great experience to come.” ©/™/® 2025 Activision Publishing, Inc.

Recon Tour: The Overlook {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/2d06ba6f290ab6e354f68a6a30ccc02abab4faf9.jpg As construction nears completion on this behemoth of a skyscraper (more than twice the height of any previous building within the Verdansk conurbation), it’s worth gaining a tactical advantage on this monolithic new point of interest. The Overlook Footprint: The “Diamond” and Perimeter Security Checkpoints {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/87234e96b4e56380b19cf02b8d09145cc2fb14cd.jpg Drop into the grounds of The Overlook, and you’ll immediately see the grounds of the new skyscraper under construction stretch in a rough diamond shape around the location of the old SKN Comm Tower. Flanked by two massive cranes, the building plot perimeter runs from the corner of the main bank, clockwise past the Post Office, passing the Rothwynn Donna building, northeast to the Museum/Art Gallery, and follows the road around to City Hall. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/1705883750d4f49bc16e311bfa68f36bbe95e018.jpg All the older structures (the Burger Town, low-rise tenement blocks, the building site, and the small coffee shop and bar across from the Museum) have been bulldozed in the name of progress! Perimeter Security Checkpoints {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/e706e8492c32543bd840ce3b75b4a1fea8426682.jpg Military-style security checkpoints have been set up on the corners and roads of the plot of land within the footprint of the structure. Most aren’t secure enough to impede vehicular progress, and some have ramps to allow airborne access. These serve as helpful visual cues that you’re entering the new POI, The Overlook. Ground Level: Construction Sites {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/df4a6a95b6c8da678a2dd4135cb9f0ec68be093c.jpg Most of the groundwork around the skyscraper is in its final stages of completion, but there are plenty of barriers, fencing, canopies, and containers to use as cover in the area below each of the two giant cranes north and south of the structure. Ground Level: Restaurants {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/a6a1395b97e2d94ffd1747d4ffbd93f645348a4e.jpg Burger Town: Fans of the famous Burger Town Double Cheeseburger will be thrilled to know the fast-food chain has relocated a few meters further down the road from its previous location and is contained within the massive footprint of The Overlook. This outlet also serves as a lower entrance into the grand foyer interior of the building. Sushi Bar: Diagonally opposite the Burger Town, on the northwest side of the POI, is a small Sushi bar, within the footprint of the tower itself. Nestled in the stepped courtyard, you can quickly advance to the north crane or main lobby entrance. It’s also worth pointing out that the sight lines around this POI have significantly changed since Season 03, with much greater visibility across familiar POIs within Downtown and the surrounding districts.

1938090,Stitch Returns in Season 04,"Vikhor “Stitch” Kuzmin has escaped captivity once more, but this time he’s been extricated from maximum security detention by his nemesis, Russell Adler, the same operative who imprisoned him in an Icelandic CIA black site prison in the first place. These two share a deep history to their rivalry—one they’ll have to leave behind them if they hope to accomplish the mission ahead. ] Prepare to deploy as Stitch when he rejoins the fight as part of the Season 04 Battle Pass coming to Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone™. If you’re new to his story, read on for the main events leading up to this dramatic twist in the search for the Pantheon moles, before returning tomorrow, May 21, for the full Season 04 Announcement Blog, Roadmap, and Gameplay Trailer. Rebirth R&D: Nova 6 Production {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/fbd6c625e2acf3074959070589596386b81ff502.jpg Scanning intelligence reports, it appears to have started on Rebirth Island, where Stitch was placed in charge of production of the chemical gas Nova 6 in the 1960s. Growing up in the Soviet Union, Stitch was recruited by the KGB after graduating top in his class studying organic substances and pharmaceutical chemistry. Once he proved his skills working within the Laboratory 12 R&D facility, Stitch found himself reporting directly to the villainous Colonel Kravchenko for his new assignment on Rebirth Island. Originally developed by German scientist Friedrich Steiner for use against his country’s enemies in World War II, Nova 6 was seized by those within Stitch’s sphere of influence after thwarting a planned attack. Picking up where Steiner left off, Stitch pushed the island’s facilities to produce countless barrels of the gas, creating a large stockpile of the chemical weapon. The Eyes Have It: Raid on Rebirth Island Stitch worked for three years producing Nova 6 until his plans were foiled when the CIA uncovered the truth about Rebirth Island’s facilities in 1968. Led by Grigori Weaver and Jason Hudson, the CIA conducted a successful, but costly raid on the island. Despite Steiner getting assassinated in the conflict, Adler was able to capture and interrogate Stitch. His efforts proved unsuccessful, however, when Stitch refused to give up more than his name and rank. Eager to send a message, an angered Russell Adler gouged out Stitch’s left eye, cementing their intense rivalry. A Trip to the Gulag Returning to his homeland, Stitch was found guilty of dereliction of duty for failing to stop the American raid on Rebirth Island. Kravchenko stripped him of his rank and sent him to the Petropavlovsk Gulag, where he left the name Vikhor Kuzmin behind and emerged as Stitch. During his captivity, Stitch stewed in his hatred for the West and even his own country, which abandoned him, and his intense desire for vengeance was used to turn him into an agent of Perseus. Then the chance to exact his desires finally came when a deadly attack on the gulag left Stitch MIA. Setting the Trap {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ae686c086f143b3cecd68f0854eeb79ff496ed6d.jpg His expertise in the production of Nova 6 and the power it offered was not lost, as it was later discovered Perseus agents were responsible for breaking Stitch free from his imprisonment—members of an international spy ring composed of rogue military operators under the leadership of a mysterious figure. It wasn’t long before the original “Perseus” died, and his protégé Stitch took command of the group, before finally turning his attention to an old foe. Dropping clues to Adler regarding his return to the fight, Stitch lured the agent to a mall in New Jersey where Nova 6 was secretly being manufactured and stockpiled. He ambushed the agents on site and captured Adler. In a daring scheme to incriminate his old foe, Stitch tried brainwashing Adler using MKUltra techniques while setting his sights on Verdansk. “Adler… You Took Your Time.” {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/383ad1b33e27dc31ba13b20ba2c992d2bb83274d.jpg Adler was able to escape and dismantled Stitch’s operation in Verdansk by detonating explosives beneath the city. After being brought in and deprogrammed by Jason Hudson and Alex Mason in the 11th hour, Adler and the team tracked down his nemesis in the mountainous Kastovian terrain and prepared to end their conflict once and for all. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/151d5f7660e06b24c050ea84ee912ac24bf5ad47.jpg After an intense stand-off, where Stitch revealed the true origins of Perseus, Adler spared his adversary from execution after realizing he would be of more use alive. Instead, he had Stitch incarcerated at a remote black site prison, off the grid and deep inside the Icelandic interior, tucking him away for a day when Adler might need his particular talents. And now that day has come. A deal with the devil has been made, as Adler needs Stitch’s help to crack the codenames needed to identify and capture the Pantheon moles.

The trees have been cleared and the landscape flattened to make room for this base housing an artillery battery in active combat. The area has taken hits with large chunks blown off buildings including the Command Center and Barracks, the damage opening new pathways through the map. Watch for sharpshooters trading shots near the base of the Watchtower, from Overlook, and through the second floor of the Command Center. Move quickly down the dirt roads to get out of sight or push out to the wings, battling around the artillery pieces in the Gun Pits and the Tree Crusher facing the Hill.

Fight in the ruins of a fortified settlement commandeered for the ensuing battle, a parked missile carrier facing out over the valley where a convoy lies in ruins on the narrow road leading up to the map.

Watch for crossfire down the long center Road as Operators fight for control of the vantage points in the Tower and the upper levels of the Shoot House and Garage. Shooting targets move back and forth on their tracks behind the Office and several other spots adding a useful diversion while preparing for the next fight.

Prisoner of War Zone: An inspection of the three different Gulag Showers variants, all identical to the originals, from the rock-throwing rivals along the upper cell blocks to the cracked tiles of the arenas themselves. Unmarked Areas: A further graphical showcase across Verdansk: A visual tour of the minor points of interest you remember, from Fire Stations to Burger Towns, as well as the unique POIs scattered across the map.

Before your return to the original, back-to-basics gameplay that Season 03 Verdansk delivers, here’s an in-depth recon reminiscence to jog a memory or two, starting with a clean and fully annotated Tac-Map: Note: Before you tour the map, ensure you’re up to date with all Season 03 content by checking out the following blogs prior to the season launch: Read This Now: Return to Verdansk Read This Now: Verdansk Tac-Atlas March 27: Season 03 Announcement (Multiplayer, Zombies, General Content Intel) March 28: Updates to Ricochet: Anti-Cheat™ and security updates April 2: Battle Pass, BlackCell and Store Bundles Blog Then make sure you preload the game prior Black Ops 6’s Season 03 launch on April 2, which comes with a 24-hour Free Trial featuring all premium content available to everyone, and the launch of Verdansk and Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3!

Verdansk: Major Points of InterestDam {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/03cb25ca03cf7d6ef8b1dbe121fc907ac34aa9c7.jpg CAPTION: Gora Dam: Gain the high ground at the Dam complex, the only area of Verdansk still iced over. Expect a frosty reception as you traverse the large dominant dam structures that provide elevational advantages and excellent views across much of the rest of the map. While there are interior Ascenders from the tunnels inside the lower generator complex up to the sluice gate towers either side of the Dam wall, the parked helicopter is perhaps the most versatile way to get around this facility. Also check the thick ice behind the Dam. Is that the faint outline of a submarine you can see below the surface? No, it isn’t. Though that rumor is still likely to persist. Military Base {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/055762baa95e8cae74942df7c5673b41fdc3152a.jpg Arklov Peak Military Base: On the upper plateau below the northern mountains sits a large Military Base that has seen recent action. Featuring a runway; numerous numbered hangars; a maze of barracks, warehouses, and storage areas; and a Killhouse training yard, there’s much to discover (and loot) in these parts. Quarry {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/50f9190f8cc4c41a305c7dc77ec8912397c58049.jpg Karst River Quarry: Mining the vast Arklov range for various rocks and minerals since 1961, the Quarry is a vast complex of interconnecting warehouses, refineries, dirt roads, rail lines, yards filled with weighty cubes of stone, and… secrets. Airport {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/b510c801f1761259e96545523c4444cc4fd21d31.jpg Verdansk International Airport: Likely a dangerous and active combat zone, Airport features long-range sniping opportunities at the Control Tower, a long underground roadway, vast terminal buildings, and a large Airport Maintenance Hangar complex. Though giant concrete jacks dot the runway in greater numbers than before, this is still a risky place to venture into without a proper game plan. Storage Town {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/08d89be72ef946aa3174b70681764c6d4384a02f.jpg Storage Town: A bona fide hot drop, this is a maze of over 30 garage structures with six alleyways running north to south and three alleys running east to west. Among this collection of self-storage garages are military tents and a few small brick or metal container offices. Every structure but one is a single level and has a roof you can climb on using nearby scenery. These tight combat corridors result in ambushes being a frequent occurrence. Venture east to visit the last remaining farmsteads in this zone, and south to the infamous swimming pool.

The original, Call of Duty: Warzone Battle Royale experience returns as Verdansk arrives for players to dive into at the start of Season 03! This is a return to the game’s initial Battle Royale roots, with back-to-basics gameplay, an authentic rebuilding of the Big Map, along with an impressive number of quality-of-life improvements. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/f364e23c33f357da0bb96f3c2d32fd5b90e38489.jpg In this highly detailed blog, we break down the rebuilding process of Verdansk, a lengthy showcase of the game’s features, the host of modes, event rewards, and initial weapon details, as well as how to prepare for launch. Separate to this blog is the Tour of Verdansk, a visual recon of all the major Points of Interest, as well as smaller, but still important locations you’ll remember from your past drops.

All the details you need to know are later in this blog. Part 1: Rebuilt from the Ground Up. Just as you Remember it* Familiar, Enhanced, and Improved: Verdansk is rebuilt from the ground up meticulously recreated with a variety of light adjustments and quality-of-life improvements. Examples You Need to Know: Expect intel on some of the exact one-to-one map duplications, enhanced details on structures and draw distances, additional cosmetic details, improved access along steep slopes and across buildings, and more. Combat on the Kastovian Coast: Get ready for engagements along the southern cliffs; the newly accessible coast and shoreline trenches are detailed. When Verdansk returns on April 3, 2025, players who dropped in five years previously on March 10, 2020, should instantly recognize this as the original Big Map Call of Duty: Warzone experience. This version of Verdansk has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up to give you the very best battle royale experience possible. That experience balances the immersion, adjusted movement mechanics, and the signature gameplay you remember from the original Call of Duty: Warzone with one overriding goal: To relive the classic and nostalgic Verdansk map we all remember. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/e809299f49f4586035ffb49550e695723d81a3a5.jpg From exploring the rugged wilderness of the northern villages, Military Base and Quarry, to the first time landing at Superstore or Hospital, to surviving your first 1v1 prison Gulag, a great deal of work has gone into making Verdansk as exact, detailed, and authentic an update as possible. In the most basic terms, this version of Verdansk is 95% a rebuilt version of Verdansk in 2020, with around five percent of the map’s landscape receiving light adjustments and quality-of-life improvements. Veteran players remembering back to Modern Warfare 2019 Seasons should think of Verdansk in Season 03 as the map that dropped in March 2020, with a few elements from that game’s later seasons added – like the Metro Station entrances – and a variety other map changes scheduled across future seasons… The separate Recon Tour Blog of Verdansk’s famous Points of Interest (click here to read it), and the accompanying descriptions in that blog should be all the intel you need to understand how faithful this version of the map is. Familiar. Enhanced. And Improved: It’s the Little Things {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/7c7844edba70bf8aceba41daa3518bcd72401bee.jpg The look and feel of Season 03 Verdansk falls into one of three categories: Familiar: The map is rebuilt to be the same as the original map you remember. This is around 95% of the play space. Enhanced: Just the same as the Verdansk 2020 map with beneficial adjustments. Improved: New elements within an existing area based on the current game designed with quality-of-life upgrades in mind. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/29a198023625b34456c6c0b62b906d5affdb8eb4.jpg Let’s take a moment to look at some specific visual examples of these adjustments. Remember these are mostly very subtle and designed to be beneficial without influencing the map’s original combat flow. Note: If the following examples include comparison screenshots, images of the original Verdansk (taken in February 2020) are on the left, and Season 03 Verdansk (taken in March 2025) are on the right, as indicated on each image. Otherwise, consider all imagery to be from the current version of Verdansk.

Watch out though; the entire lobby may be on their way to claim it too! This looting meta also gets a significant update at mid-season, as additional Zones within named POIs begin to appear across Verdansk.

Near the Comms Tower just south of TV Station? In the parking lot of Superstore? These are just two of the placements from the dozens of possible Buy Station locations. Expect a subset of the total Buy Station placements to appear during each match. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ac663ebbc97f6b94e6b2367840b6ad57edf07ece.jpg Interact with a Buy Station, and you’ll discover it’s pretty much identical to the original inventory interface, even down to the vertical list of purchases (with the Equipment type under the name, and icons added for quicker visualization). The actual inventory you can purchase has also been scaled back to match that of the original Verdansk; the only Balloons you can buy now are Plunder-related! Also note there’s additional Buy Station items to buy in Plunder, mimicking those in the original game mode. Current: Specialist Perk (Mid-Season) One of the most important items of all from the current iteration of the game is set to be added into Buy Station inventories at the Season 03 Reloaded update.

Equipment: Retro Refresh (Launch) Munitions and Equipment available as “floating loot” takes the appearance of items you remember originally. The pool of Lethal and Tactical Equipment in Verdansk has been adjusted to be closer to what was originally available when players first dropped into the field. The list is as follows: Field Upgrades: Munitions Box, Heartbeat Sensor, Deployable Cover, P.D.S. (Decontamination Station), Trophy System, Loadout Drop Marker (Grenade and Crate), Armor Box, Recon Drone. Killstreaks: UAV, Advanced UAV, Precision Airstrike, Cluster Strike, Bunker Buster. Equipment: Flash Bang, Smoke Grenade, Concussion Grenade, Decoy Grenade, Snapshot Grenade, Stim, Frag Grenade, Semtex Grenade, C4, Spring Mine, Molotov, Throwing Knife. Note! Not all the Field Upgrades and Killstreaks will be available in Verdansk at launch. Expect additional content within these equipment types at mid-season and across future seasons. Remember, this retro refresh is for items appearing as floating loot within a match. Equipment you use with a visual component (the Heartbeat Sensor for example) is likely to reflect the current model. Returning Lethal: Thermite (Launch) “Explosive incendiary device that sticks to surfaces. Burns fiercely for a short while after impact and effective against vehicles. Sticks to all surfaces.” {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/8a3b964228c46539865b919c82b4f4ba46db675a.jpg Whether you’re preventing enemies from entering a tenement bloc doorway or wanting a sticky incendiary takedown that damages over time, Thermite is likely to be a game-changer.

Whether you’re warming up, want a Battle Royale match that isn’t quite as intense as facing off against 149 human opponents, or need to build up your confidence, Battle Royale Casual is likely the game mode for you. Expect the same rules set as BR, and up to 27 other players dropping in with you, but the majority of your opponents will be computer-controlled Bots, who may – or may not – be experiencing skill issues of varying severity. Like Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp, game progression is limited in this mode and results will not count towards or against your stats. This mode also doesn’t count towards your eligibility to accessing BR Ranked Play when it arrives at Mid-Season.

Black Ops Season 01 Reloaded: Incoming IntelSeason 01 Reloaded Overview: Goodbye, Luttazzis In the mid-season update for Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6, the French Syndicate continue their operation to overthrow the Luttazzi Crime Family with assistance from Sevati “Sev” Dumas and other Rogue Black Ops Operators seeking to expel the group from Avalon. If the mission is successful, the French Syndicate can next turn their muscle against Pantheon. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/d0a5ab3cbf6947dd53f9eb28c320a17778717f0f.jpg Now’s the time to complete the heist, getting rid of the Luttazzis for good. Do it all with a smile as the mid-season also celebrates the holiday season with the return of CODMAS, featuring Nuketown Holiday and limited time modes (LTMs) like Ran-Snack, Infectious Holiday, Slay Ride Resurgence, and more. ] Meanwhile, you’ll encounter old allies and investigate new haunts in Zombies, uncovering powerful new weapons and heretical adversaries in Citadelle des Morts! Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 01 Reloaded arrives imminently, on Thursday, December 5 at 9AM PT. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6: Season 01 Reloaded Zombies {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/7db3fb1af84d2e53eb5127618f547f5a9fa1ba69.jpg ZOMBIES CONTENT SUMMARY Citadelle des Morts: Encounter an unexpected ally and investigate an ominous medieval fortress in Avalon, as the zombie hordes threaten to overwhelm you! Additional Equipment: Research and utilize new powers courtesy of four elemental Wonder Weapons, the Vulture Aid Perk-a-Cola, Light Mend Ammo Mod, and Tesla Storm Field Upgrade. Plus, new GobbleGums and more! Modes Aplenty: Liberty Falls gets hellishly festive, Directed Mode comes to Citadelle des Morts later in-season, and the Zombies Training Course arrives for new players to cut their teeth on. Citadelle des Morts One of Avalon’s oldest landmarks, the Citadel is shunned by locals both for its sinister history and because it is a base of operations for the crime family known as the French Syndicate. The castle was established in the 1100s on the site of a leper colony, and construction was completed a century later. In the 1300s, the renegade knight Guy de Saint Michel and his four enforcers took over the fortress and instituted a criminal reign of terror that birthed the Syndicate. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/45d4532915be259ea1ed941305b003c62c75dd97.jpg Having withstood medieval sieges and two world wars, the castle’s prominence waned as modern-day Avalon grew and prospered. Now it is closed to the public, housing a Syndicate crew led by a man named Franco whose dealings with Project Janus have brought a dark disaster upon a place already soaked in blood. Welcome to Citadelle des Morts. After the events of Terminus, Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey—along with Peck, Raptor One, and Strauss—embark on an expedition to the European principality of Avalon, hoping to rendezvous and ally with a luminary named Gabriel Krafft. There the Operators hope to learn more about an ancient relic known as the “Sentinel Artifact,” which in turn, when its power is harnessed, may be able to save Samantha Maxis from her aethereal imprisonment. ] It is an overcast Avalon dawn. A light mist rises from the wet ground, as the crew arrives at the site of the derelict castle. A reunion with an old colleague provides confirmation that S.A.M.'s intel was sound, and that Franco—a local French Syndicate Crime Boss and the focus of Maya's revenge—is on site, with Krafft as his hostage. Unfortunately, there’s very little time for catching up. Dimensional breaches start to form around the citadel, and a major zombie outbreak threatens to overwhelm and devour the entire team. This brand-new Zombies map experience launches at the start of Season 01 Reloaded, on Thursday, December 5, at 9AM PT. Comms Team: Your Handlers “It is good to see you, my friend.

Raptor One and Oskar Strauss stand ready to provide Exfil services, just so long as Strauss’s incessant fiddling with the helicopter’s instrumentation panels doesn’t kill them both. Citadelle des Morts: A Hidden History Before learning of the new ways you can defeat the zombie hordes, it is worth gaining some perspective regarding the history of this place. The Citadel has had many names and roles over many lifetimes: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/7f79421e47918994fead03cae91c4c0dbcc47811.jpg 750 A.D.

1938090,RICOCHET Anti-Cheat™ Progress Report: Season 01 and Ranked Play,"Season 01 arrives later this week with Ranked Play launching in Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 on November 21. The team behind RICOCHET Anti-Cheat is actively monitoring systems, preventing and removing cheaters, and prepping new systems to make Ranked Play a fair and fun experience. Before we look forward, let’s share how our launch systems have fared and share insights we’ve learned in the weeks since Black Ops 6 went live across the globe on October 25. Black Ops 6 Launch Details and Data In-game reporting and internal data show that the upgrades made to RICOCHET Anti-Cheat’s systems for launch have stood up strongly against cheaters. Several systems we’ve deployed, including those in secret that were designed only to monitor data to ensure the effectiveness of upcoming detections, have been performing beyond expectation across behavioral and identification measures. For example, a new behavioral model to analyze for anomalous skill has recorded and categorized over 4.4 million data points per hour at its peak. This information feeds into a system that examines both authentic play and cheaters to better suss out bad actors based on how they play — flagging accounts for human review and potential action. As of last week, and since the launch of Black Ops 6, RICOCHET Anti-Cheat systems intervened in over 582,000 matches to remove suspicious accounts before they could win, as well as removing thousands of accounts before they played a single game. For more on in-game updates, make sure to check out the official Patch Notes section on CallofDuty.com. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/b21bbae86cee083bb329d6236b50df754e524553.jpg Ranked Play Security Updates In preparation for Ranked Play going live on November 21 for Black Ops 6, Treyarch has helped deliver several updates to combat disruptive behavior. These updates include enhanced AFK detections to battle against account boosting – one of several measures to combat boosting – and adjusting ping thresholds to require players play matches in their region to cut down on VPN abuse. To unlock Ranked Play in Black Ops 6, players will need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches. This ensures that they're experienced with multiplayer before they enter the mode and gives #TeamRICOCHET a historical match history to examine before an account enters Ranked Play. RICOCHET Anti-Cheat also uses its Replay Investigation Tool, with the ability to watch any completed match, to monitor replays of top players as part of its investigation process. For additional security, a change coming to Ranked Play is to add a manual review to any account rename requests for players at Crimson rank or higher. The RICOCHET Anti-Cheat team will also turn on systems that were initially deployed at launch to only collect data and test the effectiveness of the detections, as mentioned in the launch recap. Now that we have determined these systems are ready, they will go live with Season 01 to help flag accounts for action. The security system updates listed above will also be active for Ranked Play in Call of Duty®: Warzone™, which launches at mid-season. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/67d461ec224e8507afde3366a74b6bd3f51af06d.jpg Policy Updates The Call of Duty Security and Enforcement Policy has added new language about Call of Duty (COD) Points Acquired Fraudulently. Users that are found to have acquired COD Points via fraudulent means may have their COD Points and/or in-game items revoked. Additionally, these users may be temporarily suspended or permanently suspended depending on the severity of the fraud. Read the Security and Enforcement Policy on the Activision Support page. In our next report, scheduled for the mid-season of Season 02, we will examine our systems against the one-hour milestone we established in the pre-launch blog. As our work in the fight against cheaters continues, our team will persist in the development of updates and upgrades based on the immense amount of data already captured in the few weeks since launch. As always, the anti-cheat team always recommends you activate two-factor authentication to better protect your account and report any instances of cheating you see in-game.

As Rogue Black Ops attempt to topple the Luttazzi Crime Family and drive Crimson One forces out of Avalon, Operators in the field are going to need the finest gear and weapons for the battles ahead. Ready up with the Season 01 Battle Pass, BlackCell, and Store content dropping into Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone™ on November 14, and throughout the first part of the season.

Or purchase BlackCell for the ultimate seasonal experience, including a variety of molten hot Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, COD points, and other rewards.Turning the Page: The Season 01 Battle Pass Expanded Overview {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/4ec92fcdb6cf33fd79f69fa4167a22519b081037.jpg The Season 01 Black Ops 6 Battle Pass is brimming over with content, which is both showcased and unlocked in a brand new “Page” system. Think of the Battle Pass as a book, with 17 total pages. The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed.

All the other Pages are locked but can be previewed. Your goal is to complete the Battle Pass and access the 100 percent Completion Page at the end of the Battle Pass. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/72e87b19f064940f0bddbb4dee5b9e439309889d.jpg The Season 01 Battle Pass Page 1 Each Page contains a slight variation on the following: Around six item rewards (known as “Tiers”) that are unlocked in any order you wish within the Page. Each requires an earned Battle Pass Token to unlock. Each Page (except for the BlackCell, Instant, and Completion Pages) contains two free Tier rewards. The rest are unlocked via purchasing the premium Battle Pass, BlackCell, or the Vault Edition An “HVT” (High Value Target) Tier reward is unlocked once all the previous items on that page are unlocked. This is usually an Operator Skin or Weapon Blueprint, and sometimes there’s a BlackCell variant. When both the regular and HVT Tiers are unlocked, the Page is complete. Use the Auto Claim feature to automatically unlock rewards as you play. Or turn it off to earn Battle Pass Tokens used to manually claim rewards.Battle Tokens: Unlocking a Page {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/9733a2d61b75ebf18ffb2a75abc7cdce259129d0.jpg The Season 01 Battle Pass Page 6, with Tiers needed to unlock (from Page 1). Battle Pass Tokens make their return to the Battle Pass and work in a similar way to those in previous Battle Passes. A Token Bank is displayed in the top-right corner of your Battle Pass. These are used to unlock the l reward Tiers across all 14 Pages. Premium Battle Pass and BlackCell owners can spend these Tokens on any available Tier reward on an unlocked Page. Tiers can also be automatically unlocked by turning on the Auto Claim feature; with this feature, Tokens are spent as they are earned and not deposited in a Token Bank. Players who do not own the premium Battle Pass earn free rewards in a linear order and do not have access to Tokens.Unlocking Later Pages {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/62c2a7439e038dedf786c7a15022253b21c9dda2.jpg The Season 01 Battle Pass Page 7. If there is a reward in a later Page that catches your eye, you simply need to earn enough Battle Tokens to unlock that Page and its Tier content. BlackCell owners get the bonus of unlocking a single Battle Pass Page at any point, regardless of whether the Pages before it are unlocked. Begin unlocking Tier Rewards on that Page immediately.

The Rogue team needs gear, weapons, and intel on the remaining Pantheon members. The French Syndicate wants their rival Luttazzi faction eliminated, and any Crimson One forces driven out of Avalon. An uneasy alliance is struck. “Time to get dirty.” Meanwhile, somewhere in the Nevada desert....

Mothballed for decades, this is re-opened to all Operators at Season 01 launch! Then drop into Urzikstan at launch and Rebirth Island shortly after, both fully integrated with Black Ops 6 innovations. Modes and Features: Get situated with Resurgence, Battle Royale, and Plunder Playlists to start with, followed by Battle Royale Ranked Play and a variety of new Limited Time Modes as the Season progresses. Full Black Ops 6 Integrated: Drop into the fray using the Black Ops 6 Loadout System, with a new Dedicated Melee, three Perks, and a Wildcard. Bring over your Global Weapon Builds, access a more streamlined Gunsmith, and pick from any Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, or Black Ops 6 weapon you’ve acquired; over 170 armaments! Perks a-Plenty: The “Pick-3” Perk System allows three active Perks at the start of the match, up to six more to find in-game (including the loot-only Irradiated and Shrouded), and the infamous Specialist Perk Package is confirmed! In-Game Innovations: From Omnimovement to using Emotes and Sprays, as well as a return to a streamlined inventory, and an impressively vast Progression, Prestige, and Challenge system from Black Ops 6, Call of Duty: Warzone is hotter than an Area 99 reactor leak.

When Season 01 begins, the UI will enter its fully realized state. Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone will continue to be the primary Game Tiles on the Home tab and players will be able to instantly access both Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone for a faster, more direct path to gameplay. The Store tab will now direct all players to the full Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone in-game stores based on what you have installed. A Battle Pass tab will be introduced in Season 01 with similar functionality as the Store tab, directing players to the full Battle Pass within Black Ops 6 or Call of Duty: Warzone. With the Season 01 update, Call of Duty: Warzone will also have its own individual user interface with improvements similar to the Black Ops 6 UI. New Resurgence Map: Area 99 Season 01 brings an incredible, brand-new Call of Duty: Warzone Map into the fray, inspired by the relentless and rapid gameplay of the Multiplayer Map Nuketown. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ee3b44ba63e15483224e4d0207bf9e907194f571.jpg Set against the unrelenting heat of the Nevada desert, Area 99 – or more specifically, the Echo Ridge Weapons Station – was a top-secret government site constructed in the 1950s, concealed from the public just miles away from the original Nuketown testing site. Designed to push the bounds of radiation testing and cement American dominance, the entire region was subsequently abandoned after an unfortunate reactor leak, and the project erased by the government. Welcome to Season 01 Call of Duty: Warzone and Area 99. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/3ccd87094baad168d4dc70c3a9525f5b50e87972.jpg Expect the gameplay to be just as fast and tactical as you weave through a blistering desert environment, with main roadways to traverse either on foot or via vehicles, and locations also linked via open, sand-filled trenches, pipework, and wiring. This all takes place around a central “bullseye” Reactor. Expect that to be the hottest drop, along with a huge crane still hoisting an entire Nuketown house in the Loading Bay point of interest.

Mannequin Assembly {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/f7629e8cb73670bc66574d58022cbc71614b6720.jpg This large-scale mannequin plant dominates the northern part of the map. The plant has been overproducing mannequins unsupervised for years since the facility was abandoned due to a nuclear reactor leak, leading to disturbingly large piles of mannequin parts. Thousands of torsos, heads, and arms are strewn everywhere, as the decades of extreme heat and encroaching sand cover the exterior cargo bays with plastic body parts and dune piles.

Full-auto assault rifle. High damage and average handling. Recoil pattern starts very controllable before ramping up. For a hard-hitting, versatile Assault Rifle that performs well across multiple ranges, look no further than the Krig C. The weapon inflicts moderate damage across the whole body with a four-shot elimination within its effective range. Recoil control becomes shakier through sustained fire, so burst fire to retain accuracy or consider attachments offering improved control to help counter the ramped-up movement. Primary Weapon: Saug (Launch) SMG, Battle Pass Page 3 HVT Tier Reward, Page 11 Battle Pass Blueprint {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/a285828bd267de3081e75679eb8bd43573c48332.jpg Levels: 39 MAGS: 4 MAG SIZE: 36 Mastery Badges: Yes Attachments: Optic, Muzzle, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, Fire Mods Customize Options: Skins, Reticle Unlocks, Weapon Camos, Accessories (1), Decals (1), Stickers 3).

Pepper your enemies with a hailstorm of lead using this rapid-fire SMG that’s perfect for breaching and clearing small spaces. The Saug kicks up like a horse when fired down sights; pull down when aiming to counter the recoil or better yet improve the weapon’s already great hip-fire capabilities with the appropriate attachments, including the Tactical Laser for a killer combo of mobility and accuracy via Tactical Stance. Or go all out on hip-fire with the Akimbo Saug Stock for unmatched SMG firepower.

Fully automatic shotgun. Good range and handling. High recoil and large hip spread. What this weapon lacks in power compared to the other Shotguns, it makes up for with its rapid-fire full-auto capabilities. Its heavy recoil and large hip spread require getting up close to the enemy, but within its effective range it’s devastating. Consider equipping the Overkill Wildcard to pair this shotgun with a mid-range weapon for greater versatility. When moving into tight spaces, swap to the full-auto Shotgun and let loose.

In the first week after launch, two new updates pave the way for Season 01 and beyond with the addition of two Multiplayer favorites: the Infected game mode and the original 1950s Nuketown map. The first content drop begins right now starting with Infected, followed by the release of Nuketown on November 1. Here’s what you need to know: Play Infected the Black Ops 6 Way {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/dd0f59abfeb50414656b9b9a92e9adfba948d27c.jpg Infected makes its Black Ops 6 debut just in time for Halloween! With the new Omnimovement system in place, this Party Mode takes on a whole new life… for the living and the undead. Cheat death — or add to the undead ranks — with the most fluid movement mechanics to date. For new and returning players, an Infected match begins with one player randomly assigned as the starting infected. The infected player’s goal is to eliminate all other players. Each time a survivor is eliminated, they will join the ranks of the undead, while the remaining survivors must keep the horde at bay until the match timer runs out. Drop into the Infected playlist right now, live in Black Ops 6! Classic Nuketown Arrives November 1 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/accfa45c99394a7105aabce1d286dc2f078f3c7d.jpg The original Nuketown is back! This homage to the version players first encountered in Call of Duty: Black Ops is an exact — though graphically much improved — version of the original, keeping the classic 1950s design of the Nevada testing site. For first-time Nuketowners and returning veterans alike, here’s the lay of the land: The Streets of Nuketown {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/c45631fa1c39601d996af5563f8712435bdad7d2.jpg Built by Veteran Treyarch Map designer Adam Hoggatt and released as part of Call of Duty: Black Ops in November 2010, this remaster remains extremely faithful to the original design and layout of the map, even down to the precise placement of parked vehicles and other scenery harking back to the original three-lane design. This is Nuketown in its most original form, with a bright and bleached desert landscape, and even a double rainbow to gaze at, taking you all the way back to where it all began. Hoggatt gave a little more insight into this remastered version of his original creation. Although rumored to have been designed in just two days, it’s been a fan favorite for 14 years: ""The original Nuketown has always been my favorite, mainly because of how it came about and how the studio rallied around it,” Hoggatt said. “Recently, it occurred to me that many of our current players have never experienced the original, so they get to feel the Nuketown magic for the first time.” But Hoggatt also expressed excitement for players familiar with the original map. “I'm excited that we are bringing back the original Nuketown exactly as you remember it but looking better than ever! Those players will definitely be hit with a big wave of nostalgia. I can't wait!"" Nuketown for Dummies: A Tour of the Homes {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/96540c9a4850bf86542b64a8f71758830a2a4a34.jpg While most of the combat is centered around the bus and container truck, the interiors (and upper floors) of the opposing houses – recently installed after being constructed and shipped from nearby Area 99 – allow for a variety of excellent sightlines toward the opposing team’s spawn point. That is provided you’re not put off by the dead gaze of the plastic people inhabiting the cul-de-sac on the corner of Latchkey Road and Trinity Avenue. Welcome to the Nuketown Neighborhood: Warhead, Area 99 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/e93a4e047607937968f1a91bfbffcfa475b08086.jpg Can’t get enough of the iconic location?

The accessibility settings menu is accessed by nearly half of all players, and with the launch of Black Ops 6, we’re excited to share even more accessibility updates and new features which will allow players to further customize their experience. In Black Ops 6, we’re launching asymmetrical hearing compensation, an improved high contrast mode, updating the accessibility settings menu, and more. All the familiar accessibility features that were available in Modern Warfare® III will also be available in Black Ops 6, like graphical adjustment options to reduce motion blur and joystick setting options. Read on for more info on new accessibility updates and features coming to Black Ops 6. Introducing Asymmetrical Hearing Compensation Settings {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/fcbebbf995270c50f6c2175cf92fe087d9cd8575.jpg Black Ops 6 is proud to be the first Call of Duty game to launch asymmetrical hearing compensation settings, which allows players with asymmetrical hearing loss to create a custom audio profile and adjust audio settings for each ear. Created with veterans and players with hearing loss in mind, asymmetrical hearing compensation audio settings will now be individually customizable for each ear. In addition to the new asymmetrical hearing compensation settings, Black Ops 6 will continue to support the option for players to “Reduce Tinnitus Sound,” which replaces sounds made from Concussion and Flash Grenades with a duller sound. Customizable High Contrast Settings {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/4f7ddb42f09c339f7c525b90cf67767fdbc62fe4.jpg High Contrast Mode was first introduced in Modern Warfare III in Campaign only, giving players the option to highlight allies and enemies during gameplay. In Black Ops 6, High Contrast Mode has been expanded and advanced and is now available in both Campaign and Zombies. Players will now be able to customize the color outline of allies and enemies, allowing players with vision impairment and color blindness to tailor their player experience even more. Players will also be able to enable a “Dark Background” setting in High Contrast Mode, which further adds contrast from the background elements to assist with low vision. Intelligent Movement Newly introduced in Black Ops 6, Intelligent Movement allows players to customize four elements for how Operators move through the landscape. The suite of customizable movement includes Sprint Assist, Mantle Assist, Crouch Assist, and Corner Slice, which may help players with mobility issues reduce inputs by allowing options to minimize and customize button and stick processes. Read more about Movement in Black Ops 6 here. HUD Presets {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/820ac4ed77ce2b68413ce3fedd1b6dd30653cb57.jpg Another newly introduced feature in Black Ops 6 is the ability to adjust your gameplay HUD with a variety of Layout presets, as well as color adjustment options for your minimap. Layouts give players options to customize the HUD for optimal playing. For players who wish to reduce visual clutter or find that checking the minimap takes their eyes away from enemies, try the Target Tracker or Central Command presets. Play around and experiment with whichever preset works best for your play. Arachnophobia Settings {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/d051ca0f844fa76ef228f77c7960197758e3e6bf.jpg For the first time in Black Ops 6 Zombies, a new arachnophobia toggle feature will be available. This setting will allow players to change the appearance of spider-like enemies in Zombies without affecting their game play. Pause and Save in Zombies {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ca99aeda9c6ecf0d6f5bc0a9b3a1de593b6dd8ab.jpg Also newly arriving to Black Ops 6 Zombies is the ability in Solo matches to pause, save, and load into games (while in full health). With the return of Round-Based Zombies, gameplay is guaranteed to be fast-paced and intense, so providing the ability to pause or save a Solo game and return later can make all the difference in gameplay for some players.

Unlocking Weapon Camos Each Weapon’s quest for the final Mastery Camo – Dark Matter (MP), Nebula (ZM), and Abyss (WZ) -- is broken down into three steps: Step 1: Military Camos {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/db2165e6881e2c10b744679788a0050da821762a.jpg Each Weapon’s Camo journey begins with nine Military Camos that are unlocked sequentially by reaching progressive milestones in each mode. For most weapons, these are progressed by earning: Multiplayer: Headshots Zombies: Critical Kills Call of Duty: Warzone: Eliminations This means that in Multiplayer, just earning Headshots with a Weapon will progress through and unlock the 9 named Military Camos: Granite: 5 Headshots required. Woodland: 10 Headshots required. Savanna: 15 Headshots required. Splinter: 20 Headshots required. Moss: 30 Headshots required. Shade: 40 Headshots required. Digital: 50 Headshots required. Tide: 75 Headshots required. Red Tiger: 100 Headshots required. Military Camos must be unlocked individually per weapon. For example, if you’ve unlocked the first Multiplayer Military Camo (Granite) for the AMES 85, it can be equipped to the AMES 85 (in MP, ZM, or WZ), but not to any other weapon until you’ve separately unlocked Granite with that weapon. Step 2: Special Camos {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/2b669b5d543e1d36c6652379a3ba3cb55e0b7b78.jpg Complete all nine Military Cam...",1729529278,

1938090,"Black Ops 6:Weapons detail, part 1","Armaments Intel: Primary, Secondary, and Melee Weapons (MP, RBZ, WZ) At launch, expect Black Ops 6 to offer an exceptional arsenal of 33 different armaments to utilize, including 12 weapons all new to the franchise. As you begin to build your favorite Loadouts within a streamlined Weapons menu, and prepare for the Weapon Leveling to come, it’s worth considering the different types of weaponry available to you, how they unlock, and a closer look into a more accessible Gunsmith. Primary Weapons (25) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/589b600a39a8dc251528608a4680df6d596ae42f.jpg Your main and usually hardest-hitting weapon utilized for most of your time in combat. Expect a varied and interesting selection of weapons in each category, as well as the individual Attachments for each Primary Weapon, which are – except for some Optics – unlocked as you level each weapon up. The Gunsmith is available for all Primary Weapons. Run the Wildcard “Overkill” if you wish to equip a second Primary Weapon in the Secondary Weapon slot. Choose from: Assault Rifles (7) SMGs (6) Shotguns (2) LMGs (3) Marksman Rifles (4) Sniper Rifles (3) Secondary Weapons (6) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/e95cac091aeab2a131e86976c266fa1b29731af0.jpg Your back-up weapon, used in emergency or context-specific situations. These weapons are carried in addition to the Primary Weapon you pick, and more adept Operators tend to choose a Secondary Weapon that complements their Primary Weapon in some way. Running the Overkill Wildcard will allow players to equip two Primary weapons, as well. The Gunsmith is available for Secondary Weapons. Choose from: Pistols (4) Launchers (2) Melee Weapons (2) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/12cff94f1e8f44ecb374a4ae21b658f4cb2b73b0.jpg Your third weapon is a close-quarters armament with no ranged ordnance. Bring out your Melee weapon using the same key or button press as Melee (for controllers, this is the Right thumbstick). Tap this for a gun butt melee. Hold to bring out your Melee weapon, which will remain equipped until you swap back to your Primary or Secondary. There’s also the Weapon Cycle setting (accessed via Controller > Combat > Dedicated Melee Weapon Activation > Hold Melee/Weapon Cycle), which allows players to use the weapon swap button to cycle between Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons if they so choose. The Gunsmith is available for Melee Weapons (Cosmetics only). Choose from: Knife (1) Baseball Bat (1) Player Levels: Weapon Unlock Criteria {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/dd38985e5ade317b91f997e7fc03760a0f777f19.jpg All the launch weaponry in Black Ops 6 have specific unlock criteria, and this is related to your Player Progression (accessed via the Progression tab in the Barracks Menu). Gain Experience Points as you play matches to level up, then unlock weapons once you reach a particular Player Progression Level, as shown in the following table. Note that one weapon from each type or class is always immediately available in Default Loadouts and the rest are unlocked as you level up. Look for more information on Player Leveling later in this blog, and full details on all the Player Level Unlocks in the Launch Comms: Progression Blog. Perk Notes: Equip the following to affect the use of your weaponry in a variety of different ways: Gung-Ho (Enforcer) reduces movement penalties when reloading or using Equipment and allows reloading while Tactical Sprinting. Dexterity (Enforcer) reduces weapon motion while jumping, sliding, and diving. Scavenger (Enforcer) allows ammo resupply from downed enemies. Bruiser (Enforcer) enables Melee kills to replenish health and earn extra score. Tracker (Recon) enables auto-pinging enemies when you ADS. Cold-Blooded (Recon) prevents thermal optics from targeting you. Fast Hands (Strategist) allows you to swap weapons faster. Wildcard Notes: Equip the following to affect the use of your weaponry in a variety of different ways: Overkill allows you to equip any non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots. Gunfighter allows you to receive three extra Attachment points for your Primary Weapon. Primary Weapons (25) Assault Rifles (7) Attachment Types: Optic, Muzzle*, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, Fire Mods.

1938090,"Black Ops 6:Weapons detail, part 2","Global Weapon Builds {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/c3065d292a845448ed282361873cc88b062c95cb.jpg Whether you’re playing Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Round Based Zombies or Call of Duty®: Warzone™ (at Season 1), you can utilize a weapon build you’ve created across all three game modes. This time-saving innovation allows you to make a change to any Build or Blueprint in any game, and it permeates out everywhere the gun is equipped. Here’s an example of how this works. Let’s say you want to create an AMES 85 Variant. In the Loadout Menu (MP, RBZ, or WZ though MP is shown above), simply complete the following: Select the weapon in question and go to “+ Create New Build.” Choose the Base Weapon, or any of the Blueprints you’ve collected, as the basis of your new Weapon Build. Enter the Gunsmith, and perfect your weapon by adding Attachments, Cosmetics, and testing the weapon out in the Firing Range. Move back to the Custom Loadout screen, where your weapon has a default name, and select “Build Options.” Rename your weapon (you can also duplicate or reset it, too). Your weapon is automatically saved. Now, when you access the Loadout Menus in your other game modes (in this example, RBZ or WZ), the weapon, along with the Attachments, Cosmetics, and name, appears. All builds are saved within the menu of the individual weapon type. Gunsmith: Attachments Intel (MP, RBZ, WZ) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/36753647a36dd24085084a07beed1ea26ca0ff44.jpg Recap: As detailed at Call of Duty: NEXT, the focus for Black Ops 6 is to condense and streamline Attachments so you can easily understand the bonuses when it comes to utilizing the Gunsmith. Here are some of the changes: Gaining the Advantage: Attachments almost always come with a benefit (Pro), and not a detriment (Con), so you know you’re creating a weapon more potent than the base version. Optics for All... : Almost all Optic Attachments are shared across all weapons in a Weapon Class. For example, unlock the Red Dot Sight with a SMG and you’ll be able to equip it to all SMGs in the Weapon Class. ...Everything Else is Unique: All other Attachment Types – Muzzle, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, and Fire Mods – are unique to the weapon in question in terms of unlocking and usage. Getting Specific: Instead of having a weapon function – such as ADS speed – being affected by multiple attachments that are difficult to keep track of, they are related to a single Attachment type. For example, equipping a “Rear Grip” Attachment will always improve your handling, and the grip you choose will boost a unique combination of handling stats (to Sprint to Fire Speed, Slide to Fire Speed, Dive to Fire Speed, ADS Speed, or a combination thereof). All the different grips are designed to improve the weapon’s potency, not reduce it. Information is Power: The net result of this new system is that it allows players to make informed weapon-building decisions easily and create effective Builds without constantly needing looking up “meta” builds online. Details Matter: Don’t mistake this streamlining as “dumbing down” the Gunsmith, as your Firepower, Accuracy, Handling, and Mobility statistics can also be seen in an expanded view, with individual elements like Reload Quickness, Recoil Gun Kick, and Bullet Velocity all available to compare in granular detail. Attachment Types {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/cda5464587ae345526bc4b54377d2c199f1894d4.jpg As always, Attachments are divided into types, and each type provides a basic advantage when placed onto your weapon, along with specific additional benefits based on the unique nature of each specific part. The following table shows the 11 different Attachment Types available at launch, and which Weapon Types utilize them: Key: The preceding table has the following information related to Weapon and Attachment Types, as follows: YES: Every weapon within the Weapon Type uses this Attachment Type. SOME: Most, but not all, of the Weapon Type uses this Attachment Type. NO: This Attachment Type is not available for the Weapon Type. For example, the “Comb” Attachment Type is only available on Sniper Rifles. Note: Attachment Type Descriptions are detailed throughout the rest of this Blog, so you know what each one does. See below. Five Attachments Per Weapon. Eight if You’re a Gunfighter {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/baeda142c0f1f4acadea7c9f8e1c8bdc4da96f10.jpg Along with the weapon’s current level, the Attachments Menu also indicates the number of Attachments you can place, and have placed, on your weapon. These are known as “Attachment Points.” There are five points available, for Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, LMGs, Marksman Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Pistols. You can pick none, or up to five Attachment Points, though the more slots used, the better the weapon is likely to perform. Each weapon type has more available Attachment types than points. For example, you can choose up to five points when building out an SMG, but there are nine Attachme...",1729528650,

1938090,RICOCHET Anti-Cheat™ Progress Report: Black Ops 6 launch,"On October 25, Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 launches and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat will be live on Day One, bringing with it new technology and upgrades to protect your experience. When it first launched, RICOCHET Anti-Cheat committed to providing players with clear and transparent communication on our methods to protect the Call of Duty community from cheaters. Our technology and methods of detection have evolved so much, but the “how” and “when” we talk to the community simply needs to be more frequent and in line with our evolution. The RICOCHET Anti-Cheat team has heard your feedback, and this progress report was written to provide a meaningful update on the issue of cheating as well as outline the foundation for the year to come beginning with the launch of Black Ops 6 and what lies beyond. Over the last year, we have been investing in numerous core systems focused on decreasing the time gap between when cheating occurs and when our systems are able to act. By building on this foundation, we will be able to evolve more quickly and respond more rapidly (more on how fast we are trying to be later). What Does #TeamRICOCHET Do? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/58a0f8152345cb9dba92a879aa3a4fe8109d96b4.jpg We protect Call of Duty games. We often achieve that goal but know there is so much more work to do. So, what is cheating in Call of Duty? Simply put, it is anything that gives a player an unfair advantage in-game using nefarious software, like wall hacks or perfect aim – not to be confused with any abuse of in-game glitches. Cheating also includes account sharing to unlock gear, using software to get access to items you haven’t earned or purchased, and account boosting. All of these actions are against our Security and Enforcement Policy. And you might be wondering, how do people cheat in online games? Put simply, cheaters use software to manipulate the game, to reveal information that shouldn’t be known, or to take automated actions with superhuman speed or accuracy. We all know cars shouldn’t fly in this slice of the multiverse, but sometimes our in-game worlds disagree. The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible. These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry. But cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. There are several ways we find those breadcrumbs, for example: #TeamRICOCHET’s kernel-level driver for PC that runs as you play the game Server-side and client-side detections Machine learning models that look for anomalies and examine matches Anti-Cheat’s Replay Investigation Tool Third-party hardware detections and more How Are We Protecting Black Ops 6? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/10468df12fb27e92604039404cfab4e15b4e3534.jpg The number one thing both we and you care about is not losing another match to a cheater. A lot has been put into Black Ops 6 to upgrade security, but here is the goal we’re targeting: we want to catch and remove cheaters within one hour of them being in their first match. This metric is called “Time to Action,” and we will be monitoring our progress internally and building technology to drive this number down. During the Black Ops 6 Beta, our team was live testing a lot of its new tech to try and achieve this goal. Weekend One was a stumble. In the past, we’ve used data from console players during Beta Weekend One to train and test our systems. Put simply, even though we love our friends who game on PC, it’s nice to have a weekend to stress test systems without the risk of cheaters. Since we had to protect the game without those stress tests, our new technology was so eager to catch cheaters, that it came in a little hot. When we recognized those errors, we immediately made adjustments to correct course in service of our new Time to Action milestone. Cheaters were able to complete around 10 multiplayer matches during Weekend One before being removed. After tweaking our systems and deploying new detection methods for Weekend Two, we cut that time in half to 5 matches. That timing achieved our Time to Action goal. In fact, 25% of all Weekend Two bans happened during the first match a cheater ever played. But removing someone after they cheat isn’t perfect, so we are ramping up detections to try to stop even more cheaters before they load into a game. During the beta we stopped over 12,000 confirmed cheating accounts before they ever saw the inside of a match. Black Ops 6 on Day One is going to launch with a variety of updated anti-cheat tech. To name a few: An updated version of the kernel-level driver. Note: All features in the October 25 update will protect any title that uses the driver, including Call of Duty®: Warzone™. All mitigations...",1729266684,

1938090,The road to Black Ops 6 launch: Preload and new user interface,"The October 25 launch date for Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 is just around the corner, meaning it’s almost time to start preloading the game so you can jump right in when it releases next week. To prepare for launch, we’re delivering an update that combines the preload of Black Ops 6 and the rollout of the new Call of Duty user interface into a single download. This is one of the last steps in the Roadmap to Black Ops 6 Launch we discussed in August, with more coming in Season 01. Once the download is completed, players can check out the new UI immediately and be ready to play Black Ops 6 as soon as it is released. Here’s what you can expect in the pre-launch update arriving on Monday. CONTENT SUMMARY Preload and Play at Launch: Preload Black Ops 6 starting this Monday, October 21 at 9AM PT. Separate Downloads: On most platforms, Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone are separate downloads, offering more control over your files. Greater File Control: Keep the titles and individual modes that you’re currently playing and uninstall the rest to free up storage space. Meet the New UI: Access featured titles and modes on your Home page, previous titles under All Games, and the latest purchasable content under Store. Faster Access to the Fun: Instantly load up Black Ops 6 at launch. Starting with Season 01, instantly access Call of Duty: Warzone as well.Black Ops 6 Preload {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/a27222aee803aeb23d2f3e682d09ad15a28c5627.jpg Preloading for Black Ops 6 begins this Monday, October 21 at 9AM PT. Players who have pre-purchased the game or subscribe to select Game Pass plans can download Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies so they’re ready to go when Black Ops 6 officially releases on October 25. To make the preload as smooth as possible, players who pre-purchased Black Ops 6 and already have Call of Duty installed will receive the Black Ops 6 preload as an automatic update to their existing install, similar to previous Call of Duty updates. Players who pre-purchased Black Ops 6, but don’t already have Call of Duty installed can initiate the preload from their platform storefront. The download will be larger for players who already have Call of Duty installed as they’re getting the new UI and Black Ops 6 at the same time. Call of Duty: Warzone — A Separate Download Call of Duty: Warzone™ content is not automatically included in the default download for Black Ops 6. However, players who don’t already have Call of Duty: Warzone installed can still choose to download it alongside Black Ops 6 by selecting it in your platform’s install manager. Players can also download Call of Duty: Warzone at any point after their initial Black Ops 6 install from within the new Call of Duty user interface. We encourage players to download Call of Duty: Warzone to get the most out of their Call of Duty experience and prepare for some exciting updates coming in Season 01! There will be no impact to this change for players who already have Call of Duty: Warzone installed – you will continue to receive game updates automatically as you have in the past. Downloading Black Ops 6 with Call of Duty: Warzone On most platforms, Black Ops 6 content will not be included in new Call of Duty: Warzone downloads.

With Black Ops 6 on the way, Call of Duty will take up more space on your device if you choose to keep all of your previous content installed since a new game is being added on top of your existing files. Prepare for the Black Ops 6 download and future Call of Duty updates by actively managing what you have installed. To free up additional space, you can remove content that you’re no longer playing, including full titles and individual modes (e.g. uninstalling single player once you’ve finished the Campaign). Players can uninstall content within the Call of Duty user interface or via their platform’s install manager. After content is removed, you can reinstall it at any point if you wish to return to those games or modes in the future. A Tour of the New UI On October 21, players can check out the new Call of Duty UI — formerly known as Call of Duty HQ — after downloading the pre-launch update. At launch, the new interface will include three main hubs: Home, All Games, and Store. Each hub displays all of its content on one page, eliminating the need to scroll. Here’s a rundown of what you’ll find in each section. Home The new UI features a landing page that brings together a variety of Call of Duty content. The Home tab showcases various tiles which each serve different purposes: Game Tiles – Unlike the previous Call of Duty UI, players will now be able to directly access games, which have their own self-contained user interfaces.

1938090,Anti-Toxicity Report: Modern Warfare III results and Black Ops 6 launch,"The Call of Duty team is dedicated to fostering a positive and welcoming community for all players. Part of these ongoing initiatives involve the development and use of technology to help our teams combat disruptive behavior, in accordance with the Call of Duty Code of Conduct. In today’s Progress Report, the Disruptive Behavior team shares the latest results and upgrades made to Call of Duty’s anti-toxicity tools, which will reinforce the ongoing work toward deploying our anti-toxicity systems for the launch of Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6. Voice & Text Moderation in Black Ops 6 on Day One Voice and text moderation systems designed to combat toxic behavior already deployed in Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III will launch with Black Ops 6 on day one on October 25. This includes the global availability (excluding Asia) of Call of Duty’s AI-powered voice moderation system in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Call of Duty will also expand voice moderation support to French and German for Black Ops 6 at launch. Text-based moderation of in-game text chat and usernames in twenty languages will be deployed for Black Ops 6 on day one. The Disruptive Behavior team knows that hype and passion is part of Call of Duty’s DNA. Voice and text-based moderation tools in Call of Duty don’t target our competitive spirit – it enforces against behavior identified in the Call of Duty franchise Code of Conduct, targeting harassment and derogatory language. Similar to Modern Warfare III, the Call of Duty Code of Conduct will be visible during the initial in-game flow when players first launch core multiplayer modes in Black Ops 6, asking players to acknowledge the Code of Conduct pillars. Over 45 million Text Messages Blocked, Across 20 Languages Since Modern Warfare (2019), Call of Duty has collaborated with Community Sift to support text-based moderation. In August, our text moderation expanded from 14 to 20 languages. Call of Duty’s text moderation is available in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Turkish, Dutch, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Finnish, and Romanian. Call of Duty has implemented a new analysis system for username reports to enhance efficiency and accuracy, surfacing critical reports to our moderation team for investigation and action. The Disruptive Behavior team has also been emphasizing proactive measures for text moderation activity, reducing exposure to disruptive behavior for our community. The system also analyzes text chat traffic in near real-time, resulting in the blocking of over 45 million text-based messages in violation of the Call of Duty Code of Conduct since November 2023. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ad3a03681d3c621e8e8eaffb2fc5c17953b1fba1.jpg Exposure to Voice Toxicity Dropped 43%; French and German Support Added for Launch Call of Duty’s proactive voice moderation strategy, powered by ToxMod, has helped reduce exposure to disruptive voice chat for millions of players since its global launch (excluding Asia) last year. Since rolling out an improved voice chat enforcement in June 2024, Call of Duty has seen a combined 67% reduction in repeat offenders of voice-chat based offenses in Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone. In July 2024, 80% of players that were issued a voice chat enforcement since launch did not re-offend. Exposure to disruptive voice chat continues to fall, dropping by 43% since January 2024. At launch, Black Ops 6 will expand its voice moderation to French and German, in addition to English, Spanish, and Portuguese. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/9f45388f9235077bff641223369b1a5ba0ad6e92.jpg Call of Duty Collaborates to Battle Disruptive Behavior The Disruptive Behavior team is continually making improvements to reduce our community’s exposure to disruptive behavior as well as enhancing our moderation effectiveness across all types of social interactions in Call of Duty. These improvements include improved messaging to players, Code of Conduct updates, and enhancements to our enforcement strategies. As part of this work, Call of Duty has been working with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) since 2022 which has resulted in research paper publication and improvements to our disruptive behavior approach which include reduced time to moderation enforcement as a result of Caltech’s research contribution. The team has also worked closely with the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and their Product Innovation student cohort. This collaboration began in 2022 and continues to this day, with results of developed research providing our team with insights to better identify and combat disruptive behavior. Additionally, the team is actively engaged in research surrounding disruptive behavior and prosocial activities in gaming. The knowledge gained from these research initiatives are valuable input to be fed back into the game as part of Call of Duty’s overall str...",1728599052,

Now we’re highlighting some new faces you’ll encounter in the Black Ops 6 Campaign: Jane Harrow {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/5e796658b5bffcdaa996d0acbc44232e8109fa43.jpg An operations specialist in the CIA’s Special Activities Division (SAD), Jane Harrow coordinates mission planning and intelligence gathering alongside multiple paramilitary handlers. Harrow reports directly to SAD Deputy Director Daniel Livingstone. Troy Marshall {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ac748a3bf9e600e4bc067d7b6b86e580f25723d5.jpg Marshall has been making a name for himself in the field. A protégé of Frank Woods, he is a methodical leader driven by a strong moral compass. With a single-minded focus on overcoming adversity and a stubborn streak that borders on recklessness, it isn’t surprising that Woods and Marshall share common ground. Both men are now working with CIA handler Jane Harrow. Felix Neumann {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/597efc9f7b5f52132177862fdb223c9a1db5d6fb.jpg Raised in East Berlin after the formation of the GDR, Felix Neumann excelled at sports but showed little interest in them, preferring to read or tinker with appliances and electronic devices. Following compulsory military service, Neumann was recruited and trained by the Stasi. However, after several years within their ranks Felix began to regret his association with the brutal Stasi. He started selling state secrets to West Germany and its allies to build a nest egg, with a plan to eventually flee East Germany. After successfully escaping to the West, he made a living by providing the criminal underworlds of Europe with his technological expertise and inventions. Sevati Dumas {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/279a40542d35e3901fc19785841813ef914c789f.jpg Taken in by the Guild, one of the Avalon Crime Factions, at a young age, Sevati Dumas loyally served the crime family as they trained her to become an assassin and espionage expert. Her allegiance changed when she met the love of her life, an idealistic man who helped reveal the ugliness of the criminal underworld. When Dumas expressed her desire to quit the life of an assassin, the crime family manipulated her into thinking that her partner was an inside agent for a rival crime family. She orchestrated his death, but afterward discovered that the ordeal was a setup to keep her in line. Sevati disowned her adopted family and became an independent assassin, funneling her resources into waging a personal war against the Avalon Crime Faction. Her exploits eventually caught the eye of CIA operatives in Europe who were eager to use her uncanny ability to track down elusive targets.

1938090,"Black Ops 6 Campaign: The Story So Far, part 1","Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 continues the mind-bending narrative events of the Black Ops universe with a new Campaign set in the early 1990s. In this spy action thriller, players will encounter a cast of new and returning characters in blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger spy activity. ] To prepare for the October 25 launch of Black Ops 6, we’re taking a deeper look at the major characters and story beats in the Black Ops series. In this first of a two-part blog, we start from the beginning with a recap of the original Call of Duty: Black Ops plus important narrative from Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Part 2 sets the stage for the Black Ops 6 Campaign and provides info on Campaign challenges, as well as the rewards that can be used in Multiplayer and Zombies. For now, let’s turn the clock back more than 60 years, to the clandestine events of the early 1960s… The Story So Far — Majors Events in the Black Ops TimelineCall of Duty: Black OpsOperation 40 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/7e0965bf23f04dc773d838f356975cd3d55016f1.jpg The covert world of Black Ops began in 1961 with the opening of Call of Duty: Black Ops. Sgt. Frank Woods, Alex Mason, and Joseph Bowman are conducting “Operation 40” during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, whereby the United States supported Cuban exiles in an attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro and his communist regime. Operation 40 is off the books, its goal being the assassination of Castro in his home during the confusion of the invasion’s opening salvos. The mission is successful – or so they think – until it’s discovered that their target was a body double. While attempting to escape, Alex Mason is captured and delivered into the hands of the Russians (specifically, Soviet General Nikita Dragovich and Colonel Lev Kravchenko) by the real Castro. Mason is imprisoned in Vorkuta, a Russian gulag, where he meets Viktor Reznov, a Russian captain who players first met in Call of Duty: World at War. The Numbers Program (AKA Project Ascension) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/0dd56ed23a8661bf6464ad248b985bf0f0b80a73.jpg During Mason’s enforced captivity in Vorkuta, German scientist Friedrich Steiner, under orders from Dragovich, begins to brainwash Mason via the Numbers Program. The intent is to turn Mason into a sleeper agent who, upon receiving a number code, will “awaken” and complete the mission he’s been brainwashed to perform: assassinate President John F. Kennedy. Reznov, however, has his own vendetta against Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner, who betrayed him following the Battle of Berlin. To get revenge against these three men, Reznov also brainwashes Mason during their imprisonment with orders to hunt down and eliminate the trio. Prison Break {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/13a375e48ae2d44cf1f6eb6c784f66dabe4ca132.jpg Reznov and Mason instigate a prison break to get out of Vorkuta, rallying the prisoners to overwhelm the gulag’s defenses. On their way out, Reznov and Mason are separated. Upon Mason’s return, Kennedy authorizes a mission to kill Dragovich, who has conspired with Kravchenko and Friedrich Steiner to weaponize a chemical agent known as Nova 6 for use against the United States. In this critical scene, Mason resists violent urges against the president, brought on by his brainwashed mind. Deployment to Vietnam {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/73cfa1a2c6e99cc8207ecbe7701b3cface1cd0d3.jpg Following Kennedy’s orders, Mason, Woods, and Bowman pursue Dragovich and Kravchenko in Vietnam. The three are captured and taken to a POW camp; Bowman is KIA. During this scene, Woods is forced to play Russian roulette with a revolver, delivering one of his most iconic lines: “You can’t kill me!” Mason and Woods break free and hunt down Kravchenko, who corners Mason before Woods stabs him and jumps out a window with him just as Kravchenko pulls the pin on a grenade. Woods survives and is captured and eventually moved to a POW camp in the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang. As the narrative progresses, Mason hallucinates and believes he sees and interacts with Reznov, including during a mission on Rebirth Island where Mason kills Steiner, believing Reznov is the culprit when in fact he alone carries out the assassination. This event leads to CIA handler Jason Hudson interrogating Mason about the Numbers Program. End Transmission, Eliminating Dragovich With Kravchenko presumed dead, Mason deploys to the final mission of the game — “Redemption” — set on the Rusalka, a Russian ship, in the Gulf of Mexico. He must stop a broadcast of the Numbers Program that will activate other sleeper agents embedded inside the United States. At the end of the mission, after shutting down the broadcast in an underwater facility, Mason encounters and drowns Dragovich.

1938090,Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer – The Road to Launch,"Thank you to our amazing community who made the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer Beta the biggest ever in Call of Duty! We’re extremely grateful to all of you who spent time with us in the game and to those of you who shared your feedback. From your experiences and our in-game data, we want to highlight some key areas of feedback that we’re committed to updating ahead of launch. MAPS While our selection of 8 total maps in the Beta trended smaller in size and included some of our Strike maps (playable 2v2 up to 6v6), we recently shared that the majority of our 12 Core 6v6 maps at launch are medium-sized. We're excited about the map variety we've got this year, and we always take competitive play into consideration for Multiplayer. We’re looking forward to unveiling our map selections for CDL and Ranked Play (arriving Season 1) in Black Ops 6 in the coming months. Map size and game flow are critically important to us, and we look forward to seeing you all jump into all 16 maps at launch, with many more to follow in our live seasons. We’re also evaluating some changes to cover placement across multiple maps, including some of our Beta maps, which we’ll be able to share more details on closer to launch. SPAWNS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/2e616321f67ffab5de4e85babb846625c1941a39.jpg As a key companion to maps, we want to update you on the spawn system. One of the most important reasons we have a public Beta is gathering spawn data from our players. Now that we have two weeks’ worth of player data, we’ve already made big strides in dialing in our spawn logic and identifying and resolving issues within the spawn system across the game for launch. Players may have noticed improvements to spawn logic throughout Weekend 2 of the Beta, and as new content comes into the game and we generate even more spawn data, we’re always assessing our spawn system and will continue to make necessary updates to it through launch and beyond. PERFORMANCE Our Beta was immensely helpful in identifying and resolving some performance related issues. Over the course of the Beta, we identified several areas that were impacting in-game performance. Some areas where we've made progress on performance include resolving general script errors, addressing issues related to our in-game user interface as well as overall improvements and fixes to our asset streaming. A smooth game performance is paramount to the player experience, and we’ve been able to chase down sources of in-game “hitching” and deploy major fixes since the close of the Beta. We will continue working with experts across all disciplines to improve overall performance for launch and into the live seasons. WEAPONS {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/a2a898b44d81bb9c5b86a6fda3504e6aabee7fb5.jpg Headshot Damage We were so excited to see our new weapons in the hands of players throughout the Beta and are grateful to have plenty of data and feedback to process as we look to balance updates for launch. A common piece of feedback we saw was that low headshot damage reduced the impact of skillful play and made it difficult to challenge certain power positions. We agree with these points and are working on adjustments to many weapons to reward players who land multiple headshots during an engagement. That said, we do not want hit location multipliers to significantly affect the consistency of time to kill in Black Ops 6, so we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of headshots during launch and beyond. Bullet Penetration Bullet Penetration is another system that we will be improving for launch. In general players should notice fewer extreme cases of bullets doing far too much damage through certain surfaces (AKA Wall Bang), while also not penetrating as expected through others (e.g., those pesky snipers behind the radar dish on Scud). More to Come And of course, we continue to review data and feedback regarding general weapon feel and tuning, and we’re always keeping tabs on overall weapon class balance in the context of our entire map pool. Some specific changes coming at launch include: Improvements to fluidity of sniper ADS Improved fluidity when swapping weapons during sprint and tactical sprint. We’re excited about this one! Reduction of weapon motion during crouch transitions Small lift to shotguns and targeted adjustments across all weapons to keep SMGs from over-performing relative to other classes Weapon balance is an ongoing process and something we’re working towards at every point in our live seasons. We’ll be sharing specific details about balancing in our launch Patch Notes. MOVEMENT {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/210afd6c6c8f5a27a8608a5bf92b0151e620eede.jpg We were blown away by all your Beta gameplay clips and Omnimovement highlights, including the awesome action hero moments you were all able to pull off! We are currently working to dial-in some additional updates to improve fluidity and allow players to tune their sprint behavior to their individual playstyle.
