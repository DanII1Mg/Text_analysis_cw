252490,PIVOT OR DIE,"PROGRESSION CHANGESContinuing from last month’s controversial Meta Shift changes and our push to make meaningful experimental changes to Rust’s progression, this month we’re taking things a step further.By making progression easier! Wait, what? Bear with me.One of the main issues with Rust progression is that the majority of servers don’t Blueprint wipe, including our Facepunch servers. When you join a freshly map-wiped server but already have everything unlocked, you’re effectively skipping the entire early and mid-game. You craft late-tier items immediately, bypassing all the gear and choices before it, which completely breaks the sense of progression on a wipe. Given the current state of the game, we may as well unlock or remove BPs, which seems crazy. Today, we’re wiping all Blueprints, wiping all servers, and drastically reducing tech tree and research costs:Common: 15 (down from 20)Uncommon: 30 (down from 75)Rare: 60 (down from 125)Very Rare: 120 (down from 500)We’ve also removed scrap crafting costs from Workbenches, while Blueprint Fragment requirements remain unchanged. By drastically reducing unlock costs and removing scrap from workbench crafting, the progression curve will feel smoother without removing that sense of effort or reward. Rather than skipping straight to the end, players will be encouraged to actually use early-tier items first and naturally progress upward.Blueprint wipes bring back that sense of discovery, structure, and early-game pacing that Rust was built on. Combined with the cheaper unlocks and the removal of scrap from workbench crafting, the system should feel faster and less punishing, not a grind, while still maintaining that satisfying sense of progression and reward each wipe. The current loop of the game is that you must find components and Blueprint fragments. Through that loop, you’ll naturally collect scrap as you go, and now with Blueprint wipes, there’s a meaningful way to spend it again.Does this mean we’ll be force-wiping Blueprints every month? Maybe. We’re not committing to anything yet. We’re going to play, watch, and listen before making any long-term decisions based on the past two months of changes.BOX SORTINGGot a Storage Adaptor attached to a box? You’ll now find it has a power input and some new box sorting settings available when you open it. You can sort items alphabetically (and change what language you use), condition, count, category (matching the conveyor filter) as well as a custom snapshot mode.The custom snaphsot mode allows you to set a container up with the item layout that you want, take a snapshot of it and then the sorter will attempt to recreate that snapshot as best it can. Sorting is applied automatically 1s after an item is added or removed from the container.Box sorting is enabled on the Large and Small Wooden Boxes, the Coffin and all DLC storage items (barrels and box skins).MINI FRIDGEKeep your food fresh and neatly stored with the new Mini Fridge deployable.Designed for compact bases and early-game, the Mini Fridge offers a compact way to preserve perishables without needing a full-sized refrigerator.Requires: 3 powerStorage: 18 slotsPlacement: Fits comfortably under half-height floor buildsUnlock: Early unlock from the Engineers workbench Perfect for solo players or tight base designs, the Mini Fridge bridges the gap between early-game food storage and late-game luxury, giving you a simple, power-efficient way to keep your meals from spoiling.MONUMENT PUZZLE RESET CHANGESLast month’s Meta Shift update caused quite a lot of activity around monuments due to the new blueprint fragment system. While these fragments are designed to be scarce, we observed some undesired behaviour due to how monuments would reset to refresh their loot that was contributing to the fragments not spawning as quickly as intended.Due to the value of these fragments, camping around monuments to ambush players became a popular playstyle. While that’s a classic strategy in Rust and not something we would want to disallow, we noticed that some players were camping so close to monument puzzles and loot rooms that they were inadvertently preventing the loot from respawning. This would lead to fragments becoming even more rare, which would encourage more players to camp the monuments, which would make the problem even worse. It would also lead to long periods of pointless camping, as no new fragments were being generated.This is how monument puzzles used to work:Start a timer for 30 minutesIf a player is within range of the monument pause the timer until they leaveRefresh the loot once the timer finishesTo resolve this we’ve made several changes to how most keycard monuments reset and refresh their loot:Monument refresh timers will now only start once a player loots a container in the puzzle rooms, rather than constantly refreshing every 30 minutes even if no players have visited.Monument refresh timers will now tick down even if players are in range.Monuments will...",1762454713,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_487176015_1762455231_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

252490,META SHIFT,"BLUEPRINT FRAGMENTSThe current progression meta has grown stale, moving too fast and becoming too easy over the years, with scrap inflation and scrap being everywhere. We don't believe this has been overwhelmingly negative, but it has detracted from world PvP, especially in and around monuments, and we want to experiment more with progression. This is experimental step 1:We’re introducing a new layer of progression to the Workbench system. The aim is simple: get players back out of their bases, contesting monuments, slow down progression and clashing over territory.Workbench level 1 remains unchanged, but Level 2 and Level 3 now require blueprint fragments to craft. These fragments are found at key monuments, creating a soft progression gate that pushes players into early fights and slows down clan snowballing.Workbench Level 2 now requires 5 Basic Blueprint FragmentsWorkbench Level 3 now requires 5 Advanced Blueprint FragmentsBlueprint fragments are tied directly to puzzles and high-end loot, encouraging players to push deeper into monuments and hackable events.Basic Blueprint FragmentsAlways spawn in green puzzle rooms (x1)Always found in blue-card puzzles next to the red keycard (x2)Found in airdropsIf you chain both green and blue, you've already had 3 Fragments in a run.Advanced Blueprint FragmentsGuaranteed inside hackable crates1 in 10 chance to appear in elite cratesAlways spawn in pairsThe main areas where these can be found are:Launch SiteMilitary TunnelsNuclear Missile SiloUnderwater LabsSmall and Large OilrigsEvents: Cargoship and Ch47 crate dropYou can also convert 20 Basic Fragments into 1 Advanced Fragment, giving a fallback path.Scrap crafting costs for workbench levels 2 and 3 are now greatly reduced, allowing players to have extra scrap to unlock items from the techtree.Larger groups will naturally eventually accumulate more fragments than they need, creating an economy where fragments and workbenches are traded. Smaller groups and solos will be forced to scrap harder for their progression, making monuments hotly contested again. We'll be watching and reading all feedback, and we'll adjust and balance as needed over the coming days and weeks. As mentioned at the beginning, this is just part 1, part 2 will be released in the December update. MONUMENT PUZZLESBy design, not all monuments are equal, some have trade-offs, while others feel bad for groups but ideal for solos or small groups. With blueprint fragments, we want to ensure all mid to large-sized monuments are relevant, so with that said, the following monuments have basic green keycard puzzles added: DomeFerry TerminalRadtownIn addition, you'll now be able to find a recycler at the Dome, puzzle room. MONUMENT LOOT SHUFFLEThe meta of running the same paths in monuments has gone stale, we've not changes some monuments in over 5 years. Do you know where every monument loot crate is? Many of you will.Today, almost every monument has had the majority of its loot moved to new locations. Areas that previously had little to no loot have been refreshed, making these areas relevant again. Dead spots are gone, and new loot run paths have opened up.Our goal here is to break old habits and get players rediscovering movements, hopefully making loot runs feel fresh, least for a bit. CRATE LOOTEvery day, we see posts on Reddit, X, Discord, Facebook, of someone sharing a screenshot of awful loot roll they just got. Granted, sometimes it is terrible, but Hackable crates should always feel rewarding. We've reworked Hackable and Elite crate loot rolls, removing some of the junk. You should now always get something of use, hopefully multiple items. DRONE STORAGEDrones now have a single storage slot, able to hold a single stack of any item. While piloting the drone, you will be able to drop the contents by left clicking.Throwable explosives dropped from the drone are active and will explode with their usual behaviour, keep your eyes and ears open. SAMs and Auto Turrets will now treat player drones as hostile and target them, marketplace drones are safe.NUCLEAR MISSILE SILO The Nuclear Missile Silo monument, first introduced in May 2023 as a blue-card monument. The silo has always been a high risk vs reward location, with forced corridors and plenty of scientists to battle through, and then hopefully not door camped when leaving.From today, the monument is now a red keycard monument. This change aligns it with other high-tier areas, advanced Blueprint Fragments can now be found here.3 additional elite crates have been added throughout the silo.This change should make the silo a more valuable, highly contested destination for groups chasing top-end loot and progression.Did you know?

Developer Facepunch Studios has been deploying some hefty overhauls in recent months, but for September it's taken a slight step back from piling in new features to steady the ship and refine on what's already there.

252490,MAINTENANCE,"MAINTENANCEThis month’s update is a little lighter than recent, focused on tackling a number of long-standing bugs and improvements. We’ve been working through community feedback to smooth out some of the more persistent issues and make everyday gameplay feel that bit better. Normally, if bugs persist for several years, there’s usually a good reason for that, whether it’s being difficult to reproduce or requiring a lot of work to resolve.Looking ahead to November, we’re lining up some strong meta and balance changes. If you’ve got suggestions, don’t hesitate to share them with us across our socials, including Discord, we’re always keeping an eye out and reading through what you send.November will bring the much-anticipated Naval update. This will introduce modular boats with cannons, of course, and much more. You’ll be able to customise your vessel, set sail across the high seas, explore new ocean-based monuments, and even discover smaller outlying islands beyond the horizon.In December, we'll be celebrating 12 years of Rust, what the heck. 12! Additionally, we'll soon be announcing the Warhammer X Rust crossover DLC.LONG DISTANCE GUNSHOTSNetworking range in Rust is made up of grids. These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio. This makes the world feel incredibly small and closed off.We can now run gunshots at different distances to the network range: helping make Rust feel more alive and shaking up the meta by giving advantages/disadvantages to certain weapons.The old default was around 350 meters. The new values are as follows:Pistols / SAR / SKS / SMGs / Shotguns - 400 metersAK / LR - 500 metersLMGs / Minigun / Long Distance Rifles (Bolt Action Rifle / L9) - 600 meters This means that players will now be able to hear you from much further away if you're choosing to use stronger weapons such as the AK or a Bolt Action Rifle. TEAM BAG LABELSIt was hard to see what bags belonged to which team members, even if they named them correctly: it could be a pain to figure out.Provided you now have Building Privilege and a Hammer out, you will now be able to see which bags are owned by which team members when looking at them.MINICOPTER DAMAGE INDICATORSAdded visual and audio damage indicator effects to provide clearer feedback on minicopter health status. Players will now see progressive visual cues as the minicopter takes damage, with thresholds at 45% and 20% health remaining. Now if you see a mini leaving a raid trailing smoke and you can't hit the driver, you'll know to aim for the chassis itself!FOLIAGE DISPLACEMENT IMPROVEMENTSFoliage displacement has been improved to allow for smooth transitions. This includes when objects are removed and also makes displacement from moving sources like players look more realistic and natural.VOLUMETRIC CLOUDS ENABLED BY DEFAULTWith the last patch, we introduced new volumetric clouds as an alternative to the 2D clouds. However, we put them under experimental settings and kept them disabled by default.With this patch, the volumetric clouds are now enabled by default, with the long-term goal being to completely replace the 2D clouds. The setting for them has been moved under the normal graphics settings tab, and the quality levels are tied to graphics presets. Additionally, the graphics.vclouds convar has been replaced by graphics.volumetric_clouds.NOTABLE CHANGESAutomated Workshop Screenshots Workshop submissions using the in-client skin creator tool now automatically take screenshots that are included in the upload.Players EyesFor several years, a bug has caused players eyes to sometimes appear closed, this is now fixed!Invisible RespawnFixed players being invisible when respawning, whilst asleepRF C4Fixed C4 not being stackable after enabling RFTugboat RugFixed rugs deleting deployables when picked up, if on a tugboatBarricade placementFixed barricade deployment being blocked on sand dunes around giant excavatorEXHIBIT DECOR PACK DLCTaking the stage this month is the Exhibit Decor Pack, an illuminating collection of deployable items to glow up your base. The pack can be purchased in-game or from the Rust Steam item storeBulb String LightsGet that warm and fuzzy feeling with these decorative bulb string lights.

There's something in the patch notes for everyone, though; the survival game remains one of Steam's most-played games daily, and Facepunch promises that you'll still have lots to get stuck into even if you aren't a Hardcore player. With a long-requested menu overhaul, faster loading, metal detector changes, and improved atmosphere, the overall Rust experience is about to get much slicker too. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/august-update-hardcore-mode"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/mobile-revealed"">A new, free version of Rust has been revealed, but there's a catch</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/system-requirements"">Rust system requirements</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-july-patch-notes"">New Rust update introduces party system and an essential building upgrade</a> ",1754671291,
252490,HARDER CORE,"HARDCORE REFRESHHardcore mode is making a comeback this month, bringing with it some community requested changes and a few new tweaks we've been planning for a while.Our goal with game modes, such as Primitive and Hardcore, is to offer a fresh way to experience Rust, see how players respond, and try out different ideas. We don’t expect them to stay popular for long, usually just a couple of months. They’re not a major development focus or time sink, as most of the team is working on bigger features behind the scenes.We look forward to seeing your feedback. These game modes help guide our decision-making for the core Rust experience, so your input really does matter. If Hardcore’s not your thing, don’t worry, there are plenty of other changes to check out in the blog below.HARDCORE - FOG OF WARThe fog of war system is back on Hardcore game mode, exclusively, obscuring the map when you first spawn and slowly revealing itself as you move around the world. This is now integrated with the normal map system rather than a held item like it's original version.Our goal with this mode is to heighten the inherent risk and reward gameplay in Rust, hopefully leading players to consider their next moves carefully as the consequences for dying can be significant.HARDCORE - COMPASSAs part of an effort to make navigation more interesting in Hardcore we have added the compass as a new handheld tool item. In Hardcore mode your location on the map is now no longer displayed at all unless you have compass equipped in your belt. Once you have a compass in the belt, the player location is displayed without the direction indicator. The compass UI at the top of the screen is also completely removed, as it was in the previous Hardcore mode.Whilst the compass is available to use in all other gamemodes too, the changes relating to the map and compass UI are limited to the Hardcore gamemode only. There is endless fun to be had in spinning around in circles whilst holding the compass. I hope that it will also prove valuable to all those who enjoy roleplaying as scurvy seadogs navigating the high seas aboard boats.HARDCORE - WEAPON & AMMO CRAFTING CHANGESFirearms can no longer be crafted or researched at all. You'll now be at the mercy of what loot you find in the world, although you can now repair any weapon you find without needing to research it. We've also increased the crafting costs of all ammunition by 5x. We hope these changes will make you think twice before engaging and promote a more thoughtful style of play.HARDCORE - RESPAWN CHANGESOn hardcore, Sleeping bag respawn cooldowns have been increased to 15 minutes, while beds will now be 10 minutes. Along with the weapon crafting changes this hopefully leads to a more complex thought process when deciding whether to attack other players.HARDCORE UPKEEP CHANGESWe've doubled the upkeep cost in Hardcore mode. The goal here is to encourage tighter, more efficient base designs and reduce the number of massive, sprawling compounds that tend to dominate the map over time. With higher upkeep, players will need to think more strategically about how they build and maintain their bases, prioritising what's essential and trimming the excess.This change should help promote more frequent raiding, faster turnover of bases, and a more dynamic map overall. It also aligns with the core intent of Hardcore, leaner gameplay, higher stakes, and a tougher, more unforgiving survival loop. We'll be keeping an eye on how this plays out and adjusting if needed. MENU RE-DESIGNThis month we've introduced a refreshed look for our menu. After several years of our existing menu being built upon we've decided to create a new experience built from the ground up. Allowing us to add new features in, better UX and a more modern appearance. On load to Rust post-patch you'll notice our shiny new interface. Across the top we have the new navigation menu with all of the usual links just in a horizontal format. And along the bottom we have the social bar, the place you go to access your friends list, party system and send our message.Sandwiched between those two is where we'll hold all of the pages, content, media and everything else. HomeOur new homepage design. Primarily more of the same from the last UI but an improved focus on the most recent patch. In the top left of the interface we now have a new call to action, the Twitch Drops tile. It'll be activated when we've published a new event either coming soon or currently in progress. Bottom left we have a curated list of heroes - whether that be weekly skins, featured DLCs or even a bit of information we want to share.In the top right we've added a new area for Quick Join, see your previously played servers quickly. If you want to jump straight back into the action you can connect from the homepage. No extra clicks required. PlayA refreshed look at the Play tab.

252490,FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS,"RUST 2025: MID-YEAR RECAP & SNEAK PEEKPARTY SYSTEMAs part of one of our long term goals of reducing friction for new players, we bring the party system to make it easier to connect to a server as your friends!To invite friends to a party:Open the friends menu (bottom right of the main menu)Right click on a friendClick ""Invite To Party""Wait for them to accept the inviteOnce all your friends have joined your party the party leader can connect to a server. This will cause all party members to connect to the same server.There is also an in-game advantage to joining a server as a party. When you first spawn on the server your party members will spawn nearby each other and automatically be put on the same team. Future respawns will remain random scattered on the beach.OUTPOST SPAWNINGAfter several years of waving a radiation detector around, we’ve finally given CZ-721 in the Outpost something to do. He now offer players a mission to travel to a Fishing Village and back to unlock a new, permanent spawn point in Outpost. This new spawn point has a 30 minute cooldown and won’t count towards your bag limit. This mission is available in both Vanilla and Primitive modes, but is disabled in Softcore (as there is already a permanently available spawn point in that mode).Along with this new mission we’re also shipping a bunch of under the hood improvements to the mission system. This has been a longer term project over the last few months as we all want to make more missions and flesh this system out but the process to create new missions internally is quite cumbersome and error prone. Prior to these upgrades, creating a new mission involved a long process of manually setting up conversation nodes, filling in translation fields and lots of manual data entry. We’ve automated as much of this as possible, allowing us to iterate and create more missions faster. We’re not quite there yet but we’ve got more missions planned this year that will allow us to push these tools further. In terms of player facing upgrades, we’ve improved the conversation screen so that it doesn’t bounce around as the text is animating in, added a Mission Complete panel to communicate when a player has finished a mission and applied a lot of performance improvements as the conversation screen was quite heavy.TEAM INVITE CHANGESWe’ve made several improvements to the invite process this month in order to make it easier to find and play with your friends. You’ll find a new Invite button in the bottom left Team UI that allows you to add friends to your team even if they aren’t on the current server or online. You can also now send team invites via the chat panel by right clicking a players name in the chat.NOTABLE CHANGESPeacekeeper Mode Now display a holster warning to offending players (like the old safe zones)Headshot SoundsAdded dedicated UI sounds slider (affects headshot sounds)Surrendering HolsteredWeapons are now holstered when surrendering, no longer hiddenOptimized TurretsOptimized Turrets aiming calculations on the server for better performanceDEPLOYABLE SNAPPINGPlacing Deployables has always been a bit of a chore in Rust, especially if you want it to be properly in a corner or against a wall. We've finally implemented a solution to this, one that will hopefully be unintrusive, easy to use and help open up the building system by allowing quick and accurate placement of deployables for all.Plenty of Deployables can now be snapped. This snapping is enabled by pressing Left Shift whilst ready to place an object. It comes in two flavours: Simple and Advanced (default). These modes can be changed in the settings menu. Simple:Simple mode will try to snap the object to a wall whenever possible. It will not force any other changes, and can be used to use the wall as a simple slider, allowing custom placement wherever you would like, but with the walls help. Advanced:Advanced will do everything simple does and more. Deployables will snap into corners, and will try to snap onto similar Deployables nearby. For example a box will snap to a box, or a shelf will snap to a shelf.ABYSS PACK - NEW STORAGE TANKSAugust 2023's Abyss Pack has been updated to now include another new free item! The Vertical and Horizontal Storage Tanks have been bought up from the depths. Holding as much as a Large Wood Box, they're great places to store your salvaged loot.

Not only is this Rust's snazziest biome, it's also by far the busiest from an environmental perspective, far thicker in vegetation than the game's other areas, as you would expect from a jungle. This makes it a uniquely hazardous playspace, offering ambush opportunities aplenty for both players and prowling animals like crocodiles and tigers... <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/rusts-recently-added-rainforest-is-so-dense-the-developers-changed-how-resources-spawn-because-players-couldnt-find-them-the-jungle-was-a-bit-too-good-at-being-a-jungle/?utm_source=steam&utm_medium=referral"" target=""_blank"">Read more.</a>",1749384000,
252490,The Rust June update brings jungle changes and big combat rebalancing,"The <strong>Rust</strong> June update has arrived, and there's a lot of changes in store for Steam's biggest survival game. While there's nothing so dramatic as last month's introduction of a whole new biome, developer Facepunch isn't resting on its laurels. Indeed, jungle changes are at the top of a long list of alterations, buffs, nerfs, and other balance tweaks. Among the other inclusions are the long-rumored silencer rework, a crucial lighting adjustment, some very helpful wire laying and cosmetic base-building additions, and a fantastic tool for creative mode players, so let's dig through the details. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/update-june-patch-notes"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/silencer-update"">Surprise new Rust update transforms the survival game's stealth combat</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/jungle-update-patch-notes"">The Rust Jungle update introduces the survival game's deadliest animal yet</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/jungle-update-release-date"">The Rust Jungle update has a date, and you can test it right now</a> ",1749299231,
252490,"NERFED, BUFFED, BALANCED?","JUNGLE POLISHOne of the loudest bits of feedback we heard after last month's Jungle update: “I can’t find anything!” Fair. The jungle was a bit too good at being a jungle.Wild hemp has been reworked with taller stalks and purple flowers, so you can actually see it against the overgrowth. (Player-grown hemp remains unchanged.)More ore nodes now spawn throughout the jungle thanks to increased rock formation density and a general boost to ore availability.Berry bushes have their own dedicated Jungle population to help keep food distribution more even across the map.Cars and bikes now spawn along jungle road sides, you’ll no longer feel stranded in the canopy.Players no longer spawn directly in the jungle biome. It’ll still generate near spawn areas, but you won’t be dropped in the middle of the Jungle unless you choose to live there.Additionally, we've added several new trees that did not quite make it into the initial release.We’ve also made a pass on monument distribution. This has been a long-standing issue, and it worsened with last month's Jungle update. Good news, it's fixed! overall, you can now expect a healthy increase in the number of monuments per map.Some key highlights in testing a world side of 4500: Airfield +37% Trainyard +34% Excavator +45% Military Tunnels +28% Powerplant +17% Water Treatment +16% Sewer Branch +14%Overall, we hope all these changes bring Jungle into a balanced position.INCAPACITATE DARTI've made some changes to make this dart less OP, but still useful. There's now a blur and dim effect instead of the full screen blackout, and the fade speed has been decreased.The movement speed reduction duration has also been decreased from 6 to 4 seconds, to match the blur duration.IMPROVED INDOOR LIGHTINGWe have worked for the past couple of months on lighting improvements for the game interiors. Simply put, in the past our lighting model would darken the entire world if you were located indoors. This caused disadvantage for players looking out and advantage for players looking in as the interiors were fully lit from outside.Thanks to the efforts of the team we now have a spatially aware solution to this problem that also brings some benefits such as soft physical transitions in and out of interiors.We are still improving this new system and while this goes on, some trickier interior spaces such as large pipes and complex cylindrical buildings remain on the old system temporarily.SILENCER CHANGESWe’re making several changes to the silencer system this month, introducing two new silencer types and making the existing silencer non-craftable (now renamed to Military Silencer).The Soda Can Silencer is the cheapest to make (40 metal fragments, Workbench 1) and will last around 12 shots on an Assault Rifle firing standard rounds. It also mildly decreases shot damage and velocity.The Oil Filter Silencer is a bit more expensive (10 HQM, Workbench 2) and will last for around 48 shots on an Assault Rifle firing standard rounds.Both new silencers will apply a decrease to damage and velocity compared to the Military Silencer.Our goal here is to ensure Silencers remain a powerful tool for ambushes and surprise tactics, but don’t become a default tool to keep on your weapon during a full firefight. The existing Military Silencer’s durability is unchanged so it will still last quite a long time and should hopefully become quite a valuable item to find in high end monuments.NOTABLE CHANGESSeat swapping keybindsNew keybinds have been added to let you switch directly to specific seats in vehiclesInteraction crosshairYou can now customize how much information is displayed on your crosshairHBHF SensorThe range of the HBHF sensor can now be adjustedNeon signsNew inputs have been added to neon signs, allowing you to control which frame is displayedPropane Explosive BombPropane explosive bomb crafting recipe no longer requires explosivesMonument HeatersHeaters at the small and large oilrig now provide heat and comfortWater Pump ProtectionPump health doubledLR300 RifleQuicker LR300 deploy and improved animationMP5 DurabilityMP5 Durability increased, allowing for an additional 300 rounds before needing to be repairedVending Machine Order EditingCan now edit orders in a vending machine without having to recreate them.Shelf pick upCan now pickup shelves if they have nothing on them.IO Wire snappingHold Shift to snap wires in 90 degree increments.Lighting PolishWires, Most Electronics, and even some Light Fixtures have gotten visual update to make your base even more cozy.BUILDING QOLI made some improvements to building this month.

The terrain in this biome is flatter than other biomes, has a higher river density and thicker foliage. The jungle biome features a large variety of completely new foliage. This includes new types of bushes, such as bromeliads and monstera. New undergrowth plants like arrowroot and calathea. As well as variety of new trees like trumpet trees, jungle palms and sandbox trees. The biggest of them all are enormous kapok trees that you will be able to climb and swing from. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/0x42/jungleUpdate_biome_18.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/5W47/jungleUpdate_biome_05.jpg The jungle is much denser than what you may be used to, so be aware that dangers and predators may lurk in every corner. Or use it to your advantage and hunt your prey instead. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/9F06/jungleUpdate_biome_03.jpg The jungle biome is vast, but allows for full base building like all other biomes. Take a step inside and embrace your inner Tarzan. VINE SWINGING While exploring the Jungle biome you will encounter a new type of tree covered in vines, you can climb these trees to reach branches that provide a new vantage point. There are also interactive vines on a lot of these branches that allow you to swing from one branch to another, allowing you to traverse significant distances in the jungle without having to touch the ground. https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/1b2211b1/jungleupdate_vineswing_01.jpg Unlike our other form of aerial transportation (ziplines) vines move from one location to another, so if you are travelling as a team you will need to throw the vine back to your friends after using them so they can follow you. You can also use a vine to quickly, safely and quietly descend to the jungle floor. https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/1b2211b1/jungleupdate_vineswing_02.jpg Just like other trees these vines can be knocked down for wood, however they will create an invulnerable stump in their place and the tree will respawn after a while. JUNGLE REMNANTS Among the towering trees and thick undergrowth, you’ll stumble across small jungle monuments, each holding a glimpse into a forgotten past. These include the Jungle Ziggurat, a weathered stone structure with its own mysteries, and a scattering of ancient jungle ruins left behind by a long-lost civilization. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/6p53/jungleupdate_ziggurat_37.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/4k95/jungleupdate_ziggurat_41.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/7W93/jungleupdate_ziggurat_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/128/04/2025/1C73/jungleupdate_ziggurat_20.jpg Jungle Ruins The new Jungle Ruins are small monuments packed with atmosphere and early-game loot.

It closes in extremely slowly from behind, and only strikes when it's sure to kill. A moment of inattention in the jungle is all it takes. The challenge developing a stealthy NPC, is that it can easily feel unfair and bullshit. In Rust people are already often ambushed by all kinds of NPCs, and those are not even trying to be stealthy... To address this there are 3 different hints in game that will let you know if you are being stalked from behind, some more subtle than others. We do our best to guarantee that you won't be jumped without getting at least one cue. It'll be on you to experiment and discover those hidden signals. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/116/04/2025/4253/jungleupdate_tiger_04.jpg Do not only scan the foliage for black stripes and orange, as you may fail to notice the very rare black panther that also roams the jungle. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b2911b1/jungleupdate_panther_02.jpg Finally there is a hidden trick you can pull on tigers and panthers, good luck finding it!

Previously, it would just grab half of your item stacks, meaning you could end up keeping full stacks of low-value junk while losing all your meds or ammo. Now, it does what you'd expect: you keep 50% of your total count for stackables, which makes the whole thing a lot fairer and more predictable. This change should help reduce the friction after dying in the field while keeping the Softcore experience accessible for players who are still learning the ropes—or just trying to get back on their feet. UPKEEP TAX CHANGES Softcore mode has higher upkeep rates for doors to discourage massive sprawling bases and encourage more raiding. Building blocks are unchanged. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/102/04/2025/8Z54/softcoreUpdate_upkeeptax_05.jpg The difference is pretty significant: the average large base will now see door upkeep around 90%, compared to 30% in vanilla. Smaller, tighter bases won’t feel this as much, but sprawling honeycomb bunkers stuffed with doors will now come with a proper maintenance bill. The aim here is to discourage door mazes that sit untouched for weeks and make raiding more viable, even if you’re not rolling with a full zerg. You’ll still need to defend your loot, but you might have to think twice before slapping down that 38th garage door “just in case.” PVP DAMAGE Softcore mode has always been about giving newer or more casual players a gentler way to ease into the brutality of Rust. With that in mind, we’ve made a change that should make early PvP feel a little less punishing: bullet damage from one player to another has been reduced by 25% in Softcore. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_202409_ttk_heroimage.jpg The goal here is simple - give fights more breathing room. Instead of being instantly downed the moment someone spots you with a semi, you’ll have a bit more time to react, reposition, or even fight back. We want to encourage longer, scrappier engagements where you actually get to play the fight, not just die in it. SLEEPING BAG CHANGES Sleeping Bags/Towels/Beds will now function slightly differently in softcore mode. When destroyed, they will be replaced with a new destroyed version that will still allow the player to respawn at that point one last time. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/103/04/2025/4z81/apr2025_sleepingbagcorpses_03.jpg Once you respawn the bag will be destroyed. Bags in this state have a little skull icon next to them on the map/respawn screen. ADOBE WALL AND GATE This month, we’re introducing the Adobe external wall and gate skin pack, now available from the Rust store. The Adobe external wall and gate skin pack allows you to change the visuals of your external walls and gates. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/103/04/2025/8z00/highwalls_adobe_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/103/04/2025/1381/highwalls_adobe_15.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/103/04/2025/9y20/highwalls_adobe_16.jpg You can use the Spray Can item to reskin your external walls.

252490,PREMIUM SERVERS,"Today at 19:00 UTC, we're issuing a mandatory update - We are rolling out Premium Servers, an experimental way to filter out cheat users and create a better experience for legit players. To access Premium Servers, your Rust Steam inventory must be valued at $15 or more. This includes items from the Permanent Item Store, such as building skins, décor packs, and hazmat skins, as well as any other tradable Rust items with an attached value. Currently we do not include Rust's standalone DLC such as Instruments, Sunburn and Voice Props packs (this may change in future). https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/105/03/2025/4y97/RustClient_FZFr8oSdQm.jpg We initially communicated a $20 threshold, but after analysing data from millions of accounts, we've settled on $15 as a more effective starting point. This is based on a comparison of banned accounts versus regular players, aiming to strike a balance between accessibility and cheat deterrence, although opting on the lower end. Premium Servers will only be visible if your account meets the $15 threshold. Premium Servers will show a Premium (and clickable) Tag to provide details about eligibility. This won’t stop every cheat user, but it’s an extra layer of friction against disposable cheat accounts. Server owners can opt-in by enabling the following convar: ""server.premium 1"" The $15 threshold may change over time, and we may introduce additional factors to refine premium status. Depending on Steam traffic, brand new purchases may take up to 20 minutes to reflect onto the Premium Server authorization. You can manually refresh or check your premium status by going to the server listings, clicking the premium server tag and clicking the refresh icon. If you have premium status, it'll display on your avatar on the menu menu If we encounter any abuse or exploitation of Premium servers or the market, user accounts will be banned. All trades of Rust skins are logged. SERVERS There are currently several new freshly wiped official premium servers going live today at 19:00 UTC. To connect to these servers, you'll find them in the official server list or connect directly from the mainmenu, open the console by pressing F1 and typing ""connect"" followed by the IP or endpoint.

252490,The Crafting Update,"COOKING WORKBENCH The cooking workbench is a new deployable that allows you to cook up some new food recipes. Mixing table recipes can also be crafted here. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250227/cookingbench_01.jpg Many of the new items unlocked by the cooking workbench offer stat and modifier bonuses, so give them a taste! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250227/cookingbench_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250227/cookingbench_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/mattisaac/2025/February/meat_cooked_01.jpg Cooking food now has a visual model on all cooking deployables and cooks in real time. CHICKEN COOP The Chicken Coop is a new deployable that lets you hatch and care for your own flock of Chickens. To get started, you’ll need to find an Egg from a chicken in the wild. Wild chickens have a chance to drop an egg every minute as long as a player is nearby. https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/1b0511b1/chickencoop_01.jpg Once you have an egg and build your coop, you can insert the egg and use the “Hatch” button to grow your first chicken. Each chicken has 4 stats - Hunger, Thirst, Love and Sunlight. HUnger and Thirst are pretty self explanatory, chickens will eat and drink from the item slots in the Chicken Coop. Love is satisfied by giving the chickens a little pat on the head every now and then, while Sunlight will be satisfied as long as your chicken coop is exposed to the sun. If these needs are met your chickens will gain health, whereas if they are neglected chickens will slowly start losing health and eventually dying. If your chickens are happy, they will start laying eggs in the Chicken Coop periodically. FOOD SPOILING Meat based food items can now spoil over time, meaning you will need to store them in a Fridge or cook them before they become unusable. Raw meat will spoil after 6 hours, while cooked meat will spoil after 24 hours. The timer is reset when the meat is cooked and will be paused entirely as long as the meat is in a powered fridge. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250228/meat_spoiled_01.jpg Any item that can spoil will have a timer on its item information panel that tells you how long you have, as well as showing an icon if the item is being refrigerated and not in danger of spoiling. TRIANGLE PLANTER https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250221/triangleplanter_05.jpg To maximise the space in your farms, we’re releasing a new version of the planter that can fit on a triangle foundation or floor piece. You can plant 4 seeds in it at once and it has the same max soil saturation as the small planter (3000). We’ve also added a matching Railroad version of the planter that will be unlocked for owners of the Frontier DLC pack. To better support planter skins we’ve made the existing Railroad planter and the new Triangle version proper skins, so they won’t appear as standalone items in the crafting menu and will be compatible with the Spray Can. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250221/triangleplanter_frontier_02.jpg BEES Bees are useful to players in a number of ways. They can be farmed or turned into weapons. Natural Beehives First: you have to find a Beehive in the wild. They have a chance to create a home on an Oak Tree. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250226/rust_beehive_tree_01.jpg Next comes the harvesting, but don't expect them to take it lying down, once you destroy a hive the Bees will come. They can be a formidable opponent and can be countered by wearing a Hazmat Suit, throwing water over yourself, using a Flamethrower or using a Torch or another source of fire to prevent their attacks. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250226/rust_beehive_tree_03.jpg After collecting some Honeycomb: Extract the honey from it in your inventory. Honey is useful in a number of cooking recipies, as well as a food in its own right. It can also be sold to Bandit Camp for some extra scrap. Beehive When creating honey there is a chance for a Beehive Nucleus to spawn. This is required for our next item: The Beehive. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250227/rust_beehive_deployable_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250227/rust_beehive_deployable_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20250227/rust_beehive_deployable_05.jpg This is a player placed deployable that allows you to make Honeycomb. Place your Nucleus inside. Each Nucleus will slowly level up, going from Grade 3 -> Grade 1. Grade 1 Honeycomb is the best, and will net players the most Honeycomb over time. Remember your Hazmat Suit whilst you're harvesting the Comb! Beehives have a few stats you need to manage: Being Outside, Humidity and Temperature. Beehives like to be Outside: this means that they have a few open air walls around them. They don't like it when it rains: so keep them under shelter or have a fire running nearby, They are fussy with temperature. Ensure you build in more Temperate areas or use heaters.

252490,Rust sets a new Steam record after eleven years as giant medieval update looms,"There are many fantastic survival games to choose from in 2025, from long-standing favorites such as Valheim and Ark to modern hits like Palworld, Once Human, and Sons of the Forest. But to this day, when I think of the genre, I think of <strong>Rust</strong>. Waking up naked on a beach and hitting trees with a rock is the purest distillation of the format, and it remains as strangely compelling as ever. As it passes its eleven-year anniversary, Rust is now the biggest it's ever been on Steam, and executive producer Alistair McFarlane thanks players for the record. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-record-primitive"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-survival-game-players"">The gigantic, classic survival game Rust is flying on Steam right now</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/road-renegades"">Getting around Rust just got a whole lot easier with this new update</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/backpacks"">Rust dev finally adds highly requested backpacks, says pets are coming</a> ",1735909119,

252490,11 YEARS STRONG,"11 YEARS Servers are now wiped and Santa is packing up and clearing out the bodies, but we hope you enjoyed the Holiday Season. We're getting back to work after a couple of weeks off, which is why this blog is lighter than usual, but we're looking forward to the journey ahead in 2025! At the end of last year, we celebrated Rust's 11th anniversary, marking an incredible journey. The game continues to experience year-over-year growth, which is quite remarkable for being 11 years old. Rust is now bigger than ever! This year, we saw: Over 325 million game sessions Over 40 million hours played Over 5.5 million unique players Here's a recap of some of the major updates we did last year: World Update 2.0 This HUGE update completely changed the world and added many new unique points of interest around the world Road Renegades Added new forms of transport, bicycles and motorbikes Bags To Riches Finally added backpacks allowing players to carry more items and added the metal detector item Waves Of Change Updated the cargoship and helicopter events, additionally overhauled the Harbors Lighting The Way Allows players to see and navigate at night, we add a small illumination area around the player Seismic Shift Added a new item which will send notifications to your phone if an explosion is detected Quality Of Life Over 300 QOL changes from saving codelocks to floating items New Weapons Added 5 new weapons, the minigun, military flame thrower, SKS, High Calibre Revolver, Handmade SMG Alongside a metric ton of improvements and bug fixes. Rust continues to be a labour of love from all of us at Facepunch, and we couldn't have done it without your passion and feedback. Thank you for your continued support, be it playing the game, telling friends, and engaging and communicating with us. We've very much enjoyed everything we've worked on for the game this year. LOOKING FORWARD What’s in store for 2025? Consistency! Continued guaranteed monthly updates on the first Thursday of every month, alongside regular fixes, quality-of-life enhancements, improvements, and exciting holiday events. Next Month On February 6th, we'll release the Primitive update. The update will be one of the most impactful updates to date in changing the dynamics of early-game raiding and combat by introducing siege vehicles, primitive weapons, shields, and a dedicated game mode. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/119/12/2024/7n79/rust_primupdate_teaser_swordight_01.jpg The Primitive update represents a time in Rust where the already scarce technology and the usual homemade armaments and ammunition have been depleted from Rust's current setting, forcing survivors to fashion crude weapons with less sophisticated methods of attack and defence. The Siege Tower can be used to climb over exterior walls while players remain in cover. And it can be pushed or horse-drawn and has several floors, with extendable drawbridges that double up as shutters. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1911b1/rust_primupdate_teaser_armourset_01.jpg The Catapult will be a projectile launcher for longer distances that can utilise multiple projectiles such as boulders, radioactive barrels, and propane tank IEDs. While it does have wheels, its size makes it something that a vehicle or horse will have to help you move it towards your next target. The Ballista is a combination of a catapult and a large crossbow which was highly accurate given the heft of its projectiles. And in Rust, those features remain with the Ballista also having multiple ammo types, being able to do heavy damage to people, doors, and vehicles. Finally, the Battering Ram will be another addition that is driveable like a traditional vehicle, with a triggerable ram that damages building blocks in a radius. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1911b1/rust_primupdate_teaser_ballista_01.jpg As well as these new weapons and vehicles, we have been working on a variety of shields, a 4 shot mini-crossbow, and updates to melee damages and ranges. With this comes some improvements to horses, including their ability to tow the new siege weapons, and new skins to customise your primitive approach to gameplay and expression. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1911b1/rust_primupdate_teaser_swordight_02_alt.jpg Can't wait till February? Rust Staging Aux2 branch is publicly playable, allowing everyone to test and give feedback. Forwards Alongside next month's Primitive update, we have a ton of content currently in development, and if you're keeping an eye on our commits page, you'll already know some of what's on the way. This year, you can expect to see Cooking 2.0 bringing many changes to food management and unique buffs to foods, a Jungle biome featuring dangerous animals such as crocodiles and tigers, and changes to softcore and hardcore game modes. Outlined above is skimming the surface of only a few key features. We have a lot more planned. But what about? Performance? Performance is always an ongoing process.

The Christmas Event is once again live! https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/rust_xmas2024_snowball_01%20%281%29.jpg If you're new to the island, here's what you can expect: As you play, you will start to hear the distinct sound of jingle bells. As soon as you do, leave the warm comfort of your base and start looking for your gifts! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from you. Run up and bash open your present to receive your Christmas gift. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. But if you have enough small presents stashed, you can 'trade up' to a medium or large gift. The contents of each present varies, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and Christmas candy. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/xmas2020_santasleigh.jpg This year, you'll still be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. And the lickable candy cane club is back! As well as two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring, the stocking will fill up with loot whether you've been good or not - no coal here! The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcoook/1b1311b1/rust_xmas_tree_01.jpg The advent calendar also returns and is a craftable deployable, available to everyone during the Christmas event.

In January, we'll release a full end-of-year blog in which we'll discuss how 2024 has gone, with highlights, learnings, and our plans for 2025. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Peacekeeper Turret Hostile Indicator A turret icon now appears next to the usual hostile indicator when you are hostile and near a peace keeper auto turret. Workcart Storage A small box has been added to all Workcarts so you can store that extra loot. Waterpump Depth Change Waterpumps now work with a smaller depth of water, perfect for the new rivers. Propane Tank Stack Size Propane tanks can now stack up to 20. Dropbox Input Increase Increased to 4 input slots. Junkpile Despawn Junkpiles will now be eligible to despawn after they are partially looted. Fridge Storage Fridge storage increased to 48 slots Homing Missiles Homing missiles have been added to Bradley and attack helicopter loot crates WOLF PACKS BALANCING We spent this month bug fixing and improving the counter-plays to the wolves, as we want them to feel challenging but not unfair. The problems Using fire against wolf sometimes felt less impactful than expected, especially when wanting to avoid the fight. Even though wolves wouldn't attack as long as you kept distance and a lit torch, they would follow for a very long time. This was especially aggravating when driving wolves away from your corpse to get back your loot, but then having them still follow you and potentially cause a death spiral. Furthermore, when jumping on an elevated position to escape the wolf, it would ignore the lit torch and rush to jump up. The wolf could do very fast huge jumps sometimes up to your base's roof. The jump motion also looked weightless and not really believable. Another problem was packs of 4+ wolves. They didn't appear all the time, but players that had to face them had a really hard time. Even though packs never spawn with more than 4 wolves, they could sometimes merge. That's because wolves always come to investigate when their hear a howl, even if it comes from a wolf that does not belong to their pack. Once the player shot a wolf or they got close enough, wolves would give up stalking and weave at high speed towards their prey. For players that only had a bow, this made it hard to land more than one or two shot as the pack of wolves closed the gap. And once enough wolves were in melee range, while it was possible to prevent a single one of them from attacking thanks to hit stun, you easily got overwhelmed. Lastly it felt harder than it should have been to crouch and sneak around wolf packs, forcing players to take very long detours if they didn't want to fight. Closing words You can find more details about how we addressed those issues in the patch notes at the bottom of the page. Congrats to the players who found some of the hidden features that could be used to get the upper hand on wolves! ELECTRICITY QOL Tesla Coil Reduced tesla coil maximum power usage from 35 to 25 (no difference in time to kill) Storage Monitor Added a passthrough slot to the Storage Monitor Elevators speed Increased speed of player placed elevators by 50% Battery full charge indicator Added an output slot for when your battery is fully charged MODULAR CAR RADIOS Modular car radios are now in Rust! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241129/rust_car_radio_01.jpg This means that you can now craft a radio to place in your modular car for 120 metal fragments if you own the Voice Props Pack.

252490,ARMED AND ANIMATED,"T1 HANDMADE SMG This month we're adding new weapons, firstly filling a gap in the weapon lineup, the Handmade SMG is unlockable near the end of the T1 tech tree. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241107/rust_t1smg_inspect_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241107/rust_t1smg_workbench_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241107/rust_t1smg_workbench_02.jpg While it lacks accuracy and raw damage, it compensates for this with sheer volume, letting players unleash a hail of bullets. Skilled survivors can use it to stay competitive by timing their attacks and positioning themselves carefully, allowing for surprise bursts against better-equipped foes. SKS Unlockable at the start of the T3 tech tree, the SKS bridges the gap between the SAR and the M39. This mid-tier powerhouse combines punchy damage with accuracy, making it a reliable pick for players who want a no-nonsense rifle with solid range and stopping power. The SKS delivers balanced performance with a kick that seasoned survivors will appreciate. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240430/SKS_hero_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240430/SKS_hero_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240430/SKS_hero_04.jpg IMPROVED WOLF AI Hello I'm Maverick! I recently joined Facepunch to work full-time on the AI and it's been a blast so far. This month we're releasing the first step of a major AI overhaul. We're starting small by just updating the wolf, but long-term the goal is to update scientists and all other animals. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241106/rust_november_wolves_03.jpg The why The current wolf feels a bit like a landmine: if you're walking around and you didn't see it or hear its footsteps, you die. That issue is of course amplified in the pitch black night. Since wolves runs faster than players, once spotted your only options are to try to kill it before it kills you, or jump out of reach if possible. Since the wolf charges in a straight line, you don't really have to aim and if you have a nailgun or better it's just a matter of unloading the magazine as fast as you can. Assuming you spotted the wolf before it spotted you, hunting it was not really engaging. When shot from a distance wolves don't charge and just flee very far away, often forcing you to engage in a long hike to get its loot. The result of this is that the wolf was either frustratingly hard to handle, or trivial, with no in between. This motivated us to reshape the wolf into something that would pose a challenge that feels fair, and can be tackled in multiple ways. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241106/rust_november_wolves_01.jpg The how I could write an exhaustive list of all the new behaviors, but I think it'll be way more fun for you to experiment and I'm confident the community will find even the cool hidden ones. Forget everything you know about the old wolves and just try out stuff that seems like it should work! QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES IO Arrows New arrows that show input/outputs when looking at IO deployables Floating objects drift down rivers Corpses, Boogie Boards, Boats now float down rivers Hear player voices over CCTV Listen in on the group taking Oil Rig Disable Monument CCTV Can now damage monument CCTV cameras to disable them for 5 minutes Copy Paste IDs in F7 menu Easily get a player's ID when using the Report menu Add vendor NPC's to all Water Wells Every Water Well variant now has killable vendor GESTURE PACK DLC This month we've added more ways for players to communicate and express themselves with the introduction of our first gesture pack - available now on Rust's permanent item store. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241104/gesturepack_hero_01.jpg The pack includes 8 new gestures: Rock Paper Scissors (Mini-game) Loser / L Hand Knuckle Crack No-No / Wagging Finger Cut Throat Shush Watching You Finger Gun NOTE: You'll need to assign the gestures to a slot on the gesture wheel via our new gesture wheel customisation on the main menu under Options > Gestures (learn more below) Rock Paper Scissors Included in the pack is our first ever gesture minigame; Rock Paper Scissors.

(Note: you'll need to assign the gesture to a new slot via the main menu for it to appear on the gesture wheel) Once a 2nd player joins, you'll be prompted with UI to choose a hand/option to play - use the numerical keys on your keyboard to make a selection of either rock, paper or scissors.

The new cliffs come in two types, tall coastal cliffs placed close to the ocean and sloped inland cliffs covering hills and mountains. A lot of effort was made into making them not only look realistic, but also easy to traverse. You can run up the inland cliffs with ease, while the coastal cliffs can be scaled by jumping on the rocky ledges and protrusions. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_cliffs02_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_cliffs02_02.jpg In addition we have added many new coastal rocks close to the shore to further spice up the world. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_cliffs02_11_alt1.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_18.jpg REVAMPED ROCK FORMATIONS We have completely revamped all large rock formations in the game and decided to bring back some of the old fan favorites. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rocks02_10.jpg Formations such as the god rock, anvil rock and arch rock all return to the game. Completely new rock formations have been added and some of them even spawn off shore allowing for more base building possibilities than ever before. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rocks_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rocks_08.jpg UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS In Rust, you will now find several different canyons, lakes, and oasis of various sizes in each procedurally generated map. Canyons, Lakes, and Oases – each offering a fresh way to play with their own pros and cons. Canyons provide narrow pathways for ambushes but can be risky to navigate. Lakes create opportunities for resource gathering and farming but leave you vulnerable in open water. Oases are lush safe havens with valuable resources but will become hotspots for fierce competition. Canyons These towering landscapes offer fresh opportunities for ambushes and base building. While the narrow pathways and steep drops make for thrilling combat and strategic locations. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_worldupdate_preview_24.jpg Canyons can be rich in resources, but don't get too greedy and get caught out. Lakes These scenic water bodies add a new twist to the gameplay, offering great spots for fishing, resource gathering, farming and base-building by the shore. However, the open water leaves you exposed to attacks, and swimming can slow you down when trying to make a quick escape. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_lakes_07.jpg Oasis These rare paradises amidst the harsh desert. These lush areas are perfect for setting up base, gathering, farming, and finding vital resources like water. But be warned: Oases will attract other players looking to take advantage of these havens. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240928/rust_worldUpdate_oasis_10.jpg RIVERS Rivers are now longer, flow more naturally, and widen the longer they get. This as well as the new unique environments required a larger water system overhaul to support different water types at any altitude. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rivers02_09.jpg The ocean is now fully culled underneath the terrain, and lakes no longer stretch beyond their boundaries. Overall, it's a much more robust and future proof system. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241002/rust_worldUpdate_rivers02_11.jpg HIGH CALIBER REVOLVER The High Caliber Revolver is a hand-crafted, single-action revolver that uses 5.56 ammo. Built for precise, long-range shots rather than rapid fire, it demands a steady hand for maximum accuracy. Its slower fire rate reflects the single-action design, but the power and precision make each shot count. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_highcaliberrevolver_tabletop_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20241003/rust_highcaliberrevolver_tabletop_06.jpg Unlockable at a Tier 2 workbench, the High Caliber is for survivors who prioritize accuracy and impact over speed.

252490,TIME TO KILL,"DIGITAL CLOCK Meet the Digital Clock, a new craftable item, a simple but powerful addition to your base's electrical setup. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240823/digital_clock_02.jpg When powered, it displays the current server time Consumes 1 power Available at the Tier 2 Workbench Craftable for 100 Metal Fragments The clock also allows you to set up alarms. When an alarm goes off, the power will pass through, allowing you to trigger any sort of circuit inside your base at specific times. Whether you want to automate your farms, activate traps, or control lighting systems, you can set up to five alarms simultaneously. GCO WEAPON ATTACHMENT A powerful new cutting-edge experimental weapon attachment for those who crave more damage and speed in their shots. The Gas Compression Overdrive attachment boosts projectile damage and velocity, allowing you to hit harder. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240905/rust_202409_ttk_heroimage.jpg However, this extra power comes with trade-offs, a slower fire rate and increased recoil. If you can handle the extra kick, this attachment is maybe for you. The GCO attachment works on the following weapons: Thompson, SAR, SAP, M92, M39 and the Custom SMG. WALLPAPERS This month, we're adding wallpapers, a new way to decorate your base's interior. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240828/rust_wallpaper_placement_01.jpg Wallpapers can only be applied to the interior side of your walls. Purely visual, they don't provide any additional protection, are easy to remove and won't interfere with the deployment of any other items. Default blueprint Crafting cost: 10 cloth for 2 pieces of wallpaper Includes 'Vintage' default skin in 4 colours - blue, red, green and yellow https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_defaultskins_02.jpg Just like other deployable items, wallpapers can be skinned during crafting, in a repair bench or after being deployed using the spray can. Wallpaper Starter Pack In addition to the 4 wallpapers skins unlocked by default, you can purchase the Wallpaper Starter Pack which features 22 extra wallpaper skins for styling your base. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_starterpack_collection.jpg Skins included in the wallpaper starter pack, as pictured above: Clouds Yellow Stripe Blue Diamond Fleur (3 variants) Retro (3 variants) Subway (2 variants) Geometric (2 variants) Polka Dots (3 variants) Wainscotting (3 variants) Venetian Plaster (3 variants) https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_subway_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_gallery_11.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_gallery_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240903/rust_wallpaper_gallery_06.jpg The Wallpaper Starter Pack is available for purchase in-game or through the Steam's item store. COLOURBLIND ACCESSIBILITY As part of my Hackweek last month, I explored some ways we can make playing Rust more accessible for players that experience different forms of colour blindness. Colour blindness is experienced by up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women, so it likely affects a good portion of our player base. We’ve tried to identify problematic areas in the game world, as well as in our UI, and then make those colours configurable so every player can customise the look of their game to meet their needs. Since colour blindness comes in many forms, we’ve exposed each option individually as well as some presets that we think will help for more common forms of the condition. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240829/rust_accessibility_colours_menu.jpg We’ve exposed the following options: Tree marker colours Health Bar colour Hunger Bar colour Hydration Bar colour Team Name tag colour Enemy Name tag colour Ally Name tag colour (eg. marked friendly in the contacts system) Monument blocked colour (the new radius that appears when building close to a monument) Mushroom colour https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240829/rust_accessibility_colours_treemarker.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240829/rust_accessibility_colours_mushrooms.jpg We also adjusted the contrast of the icons in the Hunger/Health/Hydration bar to make them stand out a bit more when in snowy/very bright regions. Please get in touch if we’ve missed a colour you find problematic to see, or if there are other accessibility options you think could help make playing Rust more comfortable. You can contact us via the F7 report menu, or opening a new Support ticket. TUNNEL NETWORK VISIBILITY LAYER Way, way back in the ancient times of December 2022, we shipped a feature that allowed us to separate the above ground and below ground networking groups, improving client performance and reducing network traffic. Unfortunately, we had to disable it pretty quickly on launch as we discovered an edge case where a small number of elevators that started in the above ground layer and ended in the below ground layer would teleport players into a vo...",1725558358,

252490,STAY ALERT,"TIN CAN ALARM This month, we're adding the Tin Can Alarm, a new primitive trap made from hanging tin cans. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240729/tincan_alarm_02_1080p.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240729/tincan_alarm_06_1080p.jpg Crossing its wire will trigger the trap and cause a loud clatter, alerting anyone nearby to your presence. You can deploy it anywhere from your base to inside monuments. Use it strategically to cover access points and defend your positions. REPLICATED BUSH SOUNDS This month, we are changing how the classic bush rustle sounds work. Bush sounds will now be audible to players around you. Just like with footsteps, you now need to take care of when you make noise in bushes. Going slower through a bush makes a quieter sound than when running through it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240731/bush_sounds_01.jpg This change will also cause the rustles made in hot air balloon tarps to be audible to players nearby, and operates in the same way as the bushes. UNDERWATER ITEMS https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b3011b1/chrome_6klbgq2xDw.png Dropped items that end up in bodies of water will now sink more realistically instead of just dropping like they are still falling through air. As well as slowing down and getting shifted around by currents they will also emit some bubbles as they move and when they hit the ocean floor. This should make finding these items a little bit easier. ZIPLINE IMPROVEMENTS We’ve made several changes to the powerline zipline system this month to make it a bit more pleasant to use. Ziplines will now pick the furthest possible destination instead of the closest We’ve increased the maximum length a zipline can run from 150m to 185m Ziplines can now terminate at a higher point on the powerline structure and will pick these higher destinations when possible, reducing the amount of climbing required to continue the zipline. You can no longer get dismounted by trees when on a zipline. We already had several systems in place to prevent trees spawning in zipline paths, but it still happened very rarely. These changes should result in longer, higher ziplines that are safer to use. NPC VENDOR PRICE CHANGES After looking over the data from last months wipe, it was clear that the dynamic vendor pricing system wasn’t operating as well as it could have. It tended to drop to 50% off all items relatively quickly in the wipe. We’ve made a couple of changes this month: Price changes now operate in real time rather than based on in-game time. This should be more understandable and will work correctly on servers that manipulate in-game time. Price changes now take place every 5 real time hours. Last month the prices changed every 15 minutes in real time by default, so this will make the prices change much more slowly. As usual we’ll keep an eye on this and make changes going forwards. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Trains break barricades Trains can break through barricades that are deployed too close to the tracks. Bike fast turns Hold the Crouch key while driving to perform a faster turn Sidecar bike physics Sidecar bikes now drive more like regular motorbikes. Horse terrain holes Horses can now enter terrain holes - Train tunnels, the launch site ramp etc. Fire mode switch Switching your gun firemode will now play a sound. Storage Adaptors collision Can now walk through Storage Adaptors attached to boxes. Hurt screen overlay toggle Can now turn off the blood on screen when getting hurt. Saved code lock input The last entered code is now saved between sessions.

252490,COMMUNITY UPDATE 262,"FACEPUNCH'S 15TH BIRTHDAY! https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b1211b1/fp_15%20-%2050OFF%20-16x9.png Happy Birthday to us! Facepunch officially turned 15 not too long ago and we wanted to celebrate the occasion by making all of our games 50% off - including Rust and all Rust DLCs! You can get your discounts on all Facepunch games through the Steam store. Rewind to 2009, when Garry, released Garry's Mod: a sandbox game with no rules, from a mod, to officially listing it on Steam. No objectives, just pure, unadulterated freedom. Want to create a giant robot out of bathtubs? Go for it. Fancy launching a thousand explosive barrels into the sky? Why not! Garry's Mod was, and still is, the ultimate playground for gamers with a wild imagination. Fast forward to 2013, and we began work on Rust. This isn’t just any survival game; it’s a brutal, post-apocalyptic showdown where you start with nothing but a rock and a dream. Gathering resources, building shelters, forging alliances—or betraying them—Rust has taken survival gaming to a whole new level. It's a place where the only rule is: trust no one, but have fun trying. And now, in 2024, we're working on our biggest update for Rust yet, with more Twitch events planned, and even more cool things to come to the game for all types of players. There has never been a better time to play Rust. LOOTROOM 3D PRINTS https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b1511b1/rust_x_lootroom_announcement-compressed.jpg It's Official - You Can Now Get Licensed 3D Printed Rust Items! After years of watching from the side lines, we're proud to officially announce that we've partnered with Lootroom! Lootroom are now our partner for fully licensed 3D printed guns and more. So we're now working closer with them, providing this lovely and dedicated team with in-game assets to ensure that they continue to deliver high quality products to Rust fans. Here's Lootroom's story: ""It's mid-2018 and during an exciting Rust weekend with good friends, we kept joking about the fact that furnaces in Rust always have to be running. This gave rise to the desire to have a small real Rust furnace on the desk - as a reminder of this great wipe. It didn't take long and it became clear: a 3D printer was needed! The test phase went well and we were so impressed with the result that we published the furnace on various platforms and received a lot of positive feedback. When the first purchase requests came in, we knew that the whole thing had potential and that there were many Rust enthusiasts around the world who shared our interest in IRL loot. After some preparation, a first small online store was created and the perfect name with the necessary domains was also found - Lootroom. Initially, our store only consisted of the furnace in various sizes, followed by the Eoka and the P2. But after countless requests, the Rust AK default was added in May 2020 after a slight delay due to Covid-19 - a real monster compared to the smaller products we had previously offered. For us, this also involved a learning and conversion process, as our previous way of working was geared towards the smaller items. For example, we needed new shipping boxes. https://files.facepunch.com/ashcook/1b1511b1/2.jpg Lone Design, the online store for Rust server plugins, became aware of us quite early on and we were also able to offer our products there - and thus reach even more Rust players. At the same time, we also set up a successful Etsy store and have since broken the magic mark of 1k sales and 100k turnover. As we became better known, we received more and more requests for different skins and other irl loot. We created internal ranking lists with the most requested items, which we then gradually worked through. Over the years, we have continuously expanded our store and now stock more than 70 different Rust items. A special milestone was achieved in September 2021: together with one of the most successful Rust content creators ever - Blooprint - we had his Blooprint SAR on offer for a limited time. The demand was overwhelming and it gave us great pleasure to see how much gamers around the world celebrated our products. https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b1511b1/PXL_20230106_191127996.PORTRAIT.jpg We invested in more and more modern 3D printers, a new online presence and founded the official Lootroom GmbH in September 2022, based in Nuremberg, Germany. We now operate more than 20 3D printers that print IRL loot almost continuously. Our factory is streamed live on Twitch, Kick and YouTube to give anyone interested an insight into the creation process. Naturally, we prioritize the quality of our handmade products while also maintaining a consistent stock to ensure prompt shipping. Customer service and engagement with the Rust community are equally important to us. We have already shipped to over 45 countries around the world and look forward to every new customer that we can make happy with our IRL Loot. We put a lot of passion into our unique produ...",1721138878,
252490,Rust Early Access review: one year on,"Rust - Facepunch Studios' multiplayer survival sandbox - has changed significantly in the year it's been on Steam Early Access. After several months of incredible sales and gradually increasing content, Facepunch did the unthinkable: they scrapped everything. Deciding the code base for Rust was unworkable, the studio rebuilt the entire game from scratch in a new engine. New Rust looks and feels both different and familiar: like returning to your dreary university city after it's had a multi-million government investment.

252490,"The gigantic, classic survival game Rust is flying on Steam right now","It's strange. When you think of the PC games that have defined the last decade, <strong>Rust</strong>, originally designed by GMod and Half-Life community legend Garry Newman, doesn't normally spring to mind. At its conception, the enormous survival game served as an alternative to DayZ. Later, as developer Facepunch rebuilt and reshaped the idea, Rust started to have more in common with Stalker. Now, 11 years since its alpha release, it's something entirely of its own, a surreal, often slapstick world where everything can kill you. One of the most enduringly popular games of the last decade, Rust is currently enjoying a resurgence on Steam - and deservedly so. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/steam-survival-game-players"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/rust-console-commands"">Rust Commands - most useful console admin list 2024</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/road-renegades"">Getting around Rust just got a whole lot easier with this new update</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/backpacks"">Rust dev finally adds highly requested backpacks, says pets are coming</a> ",1720527584,

One is a single-person bike and one has a sidecar as well, where a second player can sit and use weapons. These are relatively fast and nimble vehicles, useful for quickly traversing the map using low grade fuel. If damaged, they can be repaired with a small amount of Metal Fragments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240701/motorbike_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/motorbike_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/sidecar_01.jpg BICYCLES Bicycles can now be found across the map on roadsides, and also at several monuments. The standard bike takes one player, but a three-wheeled variant allows a second player to sit and shoot from the rear. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240701/bicyles_riding_01.jpg The bicycles aren't as fast or strong as the new motorbikes, but they're easier to acquire, and they don't use any fuel. Instead, they slowly consume your own food and water levels. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240701/trike_01.jpg Holding Sprint while biking will have the driver stand up and give you a bit more temporary power and speed.

Handcuffed players can be pushed around and forced into vehicles and other mountables. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240702/handcuffs_firstperson_01.jpg Place the new Prisoner Hood on your victim to block their vision and disable their map access, preventing them from seeing where you are taking them. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240703/prisoner_cuffed_01.jpg Handcuffed players can hold their attack button to progress the unlock minigame. Fill the progress bar and the Handcuffs break, releasing you! Unlock progress is tied to the Handcuff item condition so that you can always eventually get free - but being damaged or pushed will temporarily interrupt your breakout attempt! Additionally, performing the friendly gesture - at any time - lets other players inspect your full inventory and modify your belt - a great way to show you're not a threat or hiding something valuable! TRAVELLING VENDOR We've added a brand new event! The Travelling Vendor. The vendor will spawn naturally on maps with ring roads (4000+) and traverse the roads. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240702/vendor_roadside_01.jpg The vendor sells a selection of wares: from basic building materials to some of the best items in the game. Each time the vendor spawns a random selection of items are chosen to sell, along with a different price each time. If you're lucky, the vendor will decide to sell something at a discount, so keep an eye out! To get the vendor to stop just run up to it, but don't stand blocking its way for too long or you will be ignored. It can't wait on you forever! It doesn't take too kindly to gunfire or selling to hostiles so make sure you're on your best behaviour. I want to say a huge thanks to the Rust Discord Community for their incredible work in helping debug and improve the vendor. QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES Ceiling Light Wiring Ceiling lights IO points are now easier to target Improved Barricade Placement Can now place barricades on rocks and dirt roads DYNAMIC VENDOR PRICING To introduce a little more variety into the NPC vending system, this month we have introduced a change that increases or decreases the sale price of items purchased with scrap based on that item’s popularity. The way it works is we now keep a running total of the average number of items sold every 6 in-game hours. Every 6 hours if the number sold is less than the average then the price of the item will drop by 5% for the next 6 hours (down to a minimum of 50%). If the number of items sold has increased above the average then its price will be increased by 10% (to a maximum of 100% extra, or twice the price). We will be starting prices at 200% so they will likely drop for a while before settling to the “market” price. https://files.facepunch.com/jarryd/1b0311b1/dynamic_pricing_1.jpg An example of the logic: The average amount of SAM sites purchased in a 6 hour window is 150, and the current price has no increases or decreases. At the end of a 6 hour window we check and see that 155 SAM sites have been purchased. Since the average has gone up, we raise the price by 10%. Since the price is now more expensive, sales drop to 120 over the next 6 hours. Since this is below the average we then drop the price by 5%, which results in a 5% price increase in total.

252490,SEISMIC SHIFT,"SEISMIC SENSOR This month we're adding the Seismic Sensor, a new electricity-powered deployable. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240604/seismic_sensor_01.jpg When powered, it will listen for nearby explosions and send a power signal when detecting any. You can configure its range from 1 to 30 meters (one foundation = 3 meters) It will output a different power value depending on the type of explosion detected A non-exhaustive list of power values from explosives: 1 power = F1 Grenade, Beancan 2 power = Explosive ammo, Satchel 3 power = C4, Rocket The idea is to let you detect and trigger circuits when you're being raided. Alarms, traps... the possibilities are infinite, we're excited to see what you will come up with! BARRICADE PLACEMENT Traditionally, we blocked all forms of building inside Monuments. This made sense back in the day when Monuments were small in size and number, but over the years, the amount of land they take up has increased significantly. We want to reward players who pick a strategic location during a fight, but it's hard to pick a good location when you're in an empty field! This is why barricades can now be placed on the terrain around Monuments. This allows you to take cover as you enter and exit monuments, as well as take cover inside the open fields inside Monuments. Applies to: Wood barricade Stone barricade Concrete barricade Sandbags Remember: Monument Structures, Concrete, and Roads still block barricades at this time. Decay and melee protection has been adjusted to account for more relaxed placement 15 minute decay 8-10 hits with melee SEE DEPLOY GUIDE OF TEAMMATES Behold the ability to see what your teammate is placing and where it will be placed! This should clear up the exact location your teammate(s) are shouting while trying to build. By default, it only will show your teammate's deploy guides when you are building. This can be changed via the options menu to 'Always Show' or to be disabled. https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/9akOLgQAp9isH5ko/bJ7gtouGI889dipM.png VISUAL FEEDBACK FOR BUILDING BLOCKED When allowing barricades to be placed into Monuments we realized... it's not that clear where the building blocked of Monuments actually starts! You will now see a red outline around the edge of monuments. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240604/monument_buildblock_supermarket.jpg This can be toggled in the options menu. Server owners can disable it via a convar if conflicts with custom Monuments. Monument building radius We also took the opportunity to adjust the building blocked size of some Monuments.

We have made a few changes to allow players recently kicked from any server to skip the queue. Holds your spot 5 minutes max Any type of disconnect (kick, internet outage, crash, alt + f4) https://files.facepunch.com/jakerich/JACKvhgkPd032as6/FtnXqjohP1OLNlHr.png WIRE SLACK When using the wire tool, you can now adjust the amount of slack in your wire using your mouse wheel while holding LEFT SHIFT.

252490,META MADNESS,"AIMCONE REDUCTION Any movement in rust would modify your baseline Aimcone so that shots taken while in motion were somewhat inaccurate. This was supposed to discourage ""running and gunning"". The problem with this is that *any* kind of motion while in a firefight puts you at a disadvantage (minor dodging) and increases the amount of RNG experienced by the player. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20220601/pvp_raid_05.jpg What I've done is reduced this penalty to zero to start, and blend it up to the full amount after 4 rapid fire shots. This means is you can now strafe and dodge while tap firing and not experience a huge aiming penalty, however full auto will be penalized. I've also adjusted the Aimcone curve modifiers for a few weapons so that more shots have a higher probability of landing closer to the center. This has been applied to the Custom SMG, SAP and LR300. WEAPON + ATTACHMENT UPDATES Weapon mods have received some love this month. BURST MOD The duration between bursts while using the burst mod has been significantly reduced to 2x firerate instead of 3x firerate. HOLOSIGHT The holosight mesh has had its edges thinned so that less of your vision is obscured while using it. This is a stopgap until we produce a new model for it. I've also fixed the Holosight reticle being affected by motion blur. MUZZLE BRAKE & BOOST Both the muzzle brake and muzzle boost have had their negatives reduced, they now have less damage reduction and less damage falloff and should prove to be far more useful. LR300 TWEAKS In addition, I've made some changes to the recoil, damage fall off, bullet velocity, and burst mode of the LR300. This should now be the best in class AR. Everything subject to change. SAFEZONE RECYCLERS Starting today, Recyclers in safezones have been nerfed. Their cycle time has been increased to 8 seconds and they now yield 80% of what they used to. This is the price you now must pay for safety. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_recyclers_safezone_01.jpg However, the recyclers found at monuments have the same cycle time as before but now yield 120%! This is to reward players taking the risk out in the open. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_recyclers_radtown_01.jpg While I am aware that a great many keyboards may be smashed as the death screen fades in over the droning hum of the active recycler, I still have hope this helps usher in a new era of roaming and monument combat. SALE SALE SALE! Some great items were not used because they were way too expensive. To that end I've made the following changes: HV Ammo - Gunpowder cost reduced significantly, and the yield per craft increased to match non HV ammo. Torpedos - Craft yield increased from 3 to 5. Incendiary Rockets - The cost has been drastically reduced and their damage + flame spread increased. Drones - Tech trash is no longer a requirement for drones. HMLMG - Gear cost has been reduced. EXTERNAL STRUCTURE CHANGES Large External Gates and Walls now require the player to stand still for 1.5 seconds when placing, making them less useful for immediate PvP encounters in the wild. We felt that being able to place down such large structures in a short amount of time felt at odds with our style of combat that rewards situational awareness and environmental tactics. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240501/rust_highexternalwall_deploy.jpg WOODEN BARRICADE RESIZE https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0111b1/rust_woodenbarricade_cover_double.jpg To fill the void left by the external wall changes regarding dynamic cover during PvP, we have doubled the size of the deployable wooden barricade. The wooden barricade remains instantly deployable and provides a moderate amount of cover on-demand without being overpowered or polluting the landscape with large, unsightly deployable. This is without a doubt a large shift to PvP, we'll be monitoring these changes carefully BRADLEY CHANGES Some further tweaks to the Bradley this month. Scientists now spawn in stages, based on the Bradley's health, and there's some Heavy scientists thrown in the mix now, too. At 80% health, 2 scientists will spawn At 60% health, 4 more will spawn At 40% health, 6 final scientists will spawn https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240405/bradleyscientists_01.jpg There's also been some tweaks to make some of the Scientists more aggressive and use varying attack angles. DOOR CONTROLLER You can now use door controllers without worrying about raiders abusing them to open your doors! This is accomplished by unpairing door controllers once your TC is destroyed & requiring code lock authorization for pairing. They also are much easier to setup as they can now be placed just like code locks. This should reduce the pain of constantly opening and closing the doors of your base... especially when your teammates tend to leave them open. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240502/rust_doorcontroller_wiring.jpg Now deployable on doors like code locks Automatically paired when pla...",1714672200,

252490,WAVES OF CHANGE,"CARGO SHIP DOCKING We’ve given both Harbors a fresh coat of paint this month, with a significant amount of visual and gameplay changes. These changes support the new Cargo Ship docking process, which allows the ship to adjust it's course and dock with the harbor. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_06.jpg Each harbor has a new island that can be reached by crossing a rotating bridge, floating containers or a daring set of jumps across cranes. This island becomes a stronghold once the Cargo Ship docks as it becomes sheltered from the rest of the harbor. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_08.jpg The ship will pick the first harbor it passes to dock and will only dock once. Once docked, the cranes in the Harbor will spring into life and move several containers from the docks onto the deck of the ship. These containers have openable doors and can be hidden in, so they present a new way to smuggle aboard the ship and another threat for players already on the ship to contend with. These containers will be deposited in locations that are generally above the deck, in some cases by several meters. This should present an interesting tactical situation when attacking the ship as well as defending it. We’ve also added two ship doors above the water line that allow access to the lower interior level of the ship and provide additional ways to board or traverse the monument while the ship is docked. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240404/harbor_refresh_10.jpg By default the Cargo Ship replenishes it's loot every 10 minutes - up to 3 times. When the ship docks at the harbor it will attempt to trigger one of those loot refreshes, although if all three have already happened it will be unable to spawn any more loot. The Cargo Ship horn will sound 60 seconds prior to it's departure - once you hear that horn it's time to get moving or you might end up back out at sea. We think these changes combined will lead to Cargo Ship being a much more contested PvP environment for groups of all sizes. We're also interested to see how a traditionally lower intensity monument like the Harbors adjust to periodic bouts of high intensity action. OILRIGS The Oilrigs receive an upgrade this month, with an underwater access. This new way to get onto the Oilrig will add a path into both structures Level 3 floors. This provides a different, and possibly safer way into the monument. It is also a way to counter the players on board by short circuiting the docks at the rigs water line. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_02.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_03.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240403/oilrig_tube_06.jpg The extra rooms inside see the addition of a CCTV desk that allows you to observe in place the camera feeds of the monument. MINIGUN The iconic minigun has been added to the game which is used by the Heavy Scientists. It takes a moment to spin up, but when it does, it unleashes a massive amount of ammunition, making targets much easier to hit. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240405/minigun_oilrig.jpg It's a rare drop useable by players and you must be at a workbench level 2 to add ammunition to it as it cannot be reloaded in the field. It also takes 1.5 seconds to spin up and lowers your movement speed while the spin is engaged. RETRO TOOL CUPBOARD We're thrilled to announce Rust's first-ever tool cupboard DLC skin! The Retro Tool Cupboard can be crafted as usual using the skin picker or applied to an existing Tool Cupboard using the Spray can item. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_01_alt1.jpg The Retro Tool Cupboard monitors display live information such as upkeep time, resources, and the number of blocks used to calculate upkeep costs. However, the data is only visible on the monitors when authorized. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_08.jpg The Retro Tool cupboard doesn't require power, the lower half of the Retro Tool Cupboard behind the glass panel displays current inventory upkeep amounts and tools. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240402/toolcupboar_retro_02.jpg When approaching the Retro Tool cupboard design, we felt aesthetics were critical.

252490,LIGHTING THE WAY,"TUTORIAL ISLAND https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0711b1/rust_tutorial_island_001.jpg A common story we hear from new players is that they have seen their friends/Twitch Streamer/YouTuber playing Rust, so they pick up the game and then bounce off it due to how harsh and unforgiving the new player experience can be. This month’s Tutorial Island is our attempt to provide new players with a safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of Rust before being set loose in the main game with other players. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/rust_tutorial_island_gameplay_003.jpg?1 Everyone will be prompted to start the tutorial when they first spawn this month, if you’re a long term player feel free to decline the tutorial and we won’t ask you about it again. Once the player starts the Tutorial, they will be respawned on a dedicated island where an NPC will guide them through the first half hour of gameplay. This island is tightly controlled and cannot be reached by other players. Throughout this process players will learn some key concepts: Basic movement Crafting Building bases Upgrading bases Respawning Basic combat Resources Looting containers Cooking Using Furnaces Workbenches Using a vehicle This obviously isn’t an exhaustive list of everything there is to learn in Rust, but we feel like this is a good starting point for a new player. Our guiding principle when designing this sequence has been - if a player emulates exactly what they did on the Tutorial Island once they get into the main game, will they have a fighting chance? https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/rust_tutorial_island_gameplay_010.jpg?1 https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240306/rust_tutorial_island_gameplay_021.jpg?1 The tutorial itself should take less than 30 minutes if you’re familiar with general FPS controls and concepts, likely around an hour if you are not a regular FPS player. Once complete you will be dropped off into the main game with the same resources as any other player - completing the Tutorial Island does not give you any advantages in regular gameplay. For server owners running mods that change core gameplay features, you may find that parts of the tutorial don’t work or maybe showing the tutorial isn’t appropriate for your server (minigame servers for instance). You can control whether the tutorial is active via the “server.tutorialEnabled” convar - it's false by default. While false players won't be prompted to start the tutorial on your server and they will not be able to manually start the tutorial. We’ve added a server tag to help players find and filter servers by their tutorial compatibility, add “tut” to your server tags to advertise your tutorial compatibility. Brand new players will have this filter on when they first use the server browser. VENDOR UI REFRESH Our outdated tooltip popup for checking vendor stock urgently needed an upgrade. It felt out of place when compared with the marketplace UI. Thus, a plan was devised to merge both into a single unified system. This update will be rolled out in two parts, with this being part one. This first part fully replaces the old blue tooltip popup with an interface that's clearer, more user-friendly, and scalable. Now, it's easy to understand what you're purchasing and how much is costs. Overall, this first pass on the vendor UI provides a great foundation to expand on. New Single Vendor Interface Items are now displayed clearly with the cost and stock counts easily visible. https://files.facepunch.com/ianhenderson/1b0711b1/RustClient_Mfw0L7f6KT.jpg New Multi Vendor Interface Accordions are used to hold vendors with large amounts of listings. This keeps everything easy to read, whilst still giving users flexibility to add a bunch of listings. https://files.facepunch.com/ianhenderson/1b0711b1/RustClient_pEu65yL25G.jpg While working on this, we noticed some QOL issues with finding items before purchasing. The marketplace offers useful features like search and filtering that the standard map doesn't have. It would be great to have these abilities everywhere. Part two will unify the marketplace UI with the new vendor UI. You will still have to travel to the marketplace to buy things via drone, but the actual underlying UI will be merged together. This will provide the same search/filtering functionalities as enjoyed at the marketplace to the regular map vendor UI, whilst bringing the improved style and ease of use of this new vendor UI to the marketplace. NIGHTLIGHT Today, I'm addressing an issue we often hear about from the Rust community. Navigating the game during nighttime. While the night cycle is a cruicial element of the rust gameplay loop, it can be a literal stumbling block not seeing what's directly ahead. The problem of ""gamma hacking"" (where players unfairly enhance their night vision by tweaking monitor settings), has been a thorn in our side, necessitating a pitch-black darkness (RGB 0,0,0) to counteract such exploits. https://files.f...",1709837328,

252490,LUNAR NEW YEAR 2024,"LUNAR NEW YEAR Happy Lunar New Year to everyone! This year, we celebrate the Year of the Dragon. In Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol of courage, power, and majesty. And to help everyone get in the spirit, we have added both new and old Lunar New Year items to the Steam item store. But don't forget to decorate your bases with trees (symbolizing wealth and good luck) and wearing this year's lucky colours (yellow and red)! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240207/rust_lunar2024_hero_01.jpg SPEAR Prim locked? This magnificent Chinese spear is for the fearless primitive warriors of Rust. This spear is a skin replacement for the wooden spear. Crafted with precision and adorned with intricate engravings, this weapon is not just a tool for battle. It's a work of art that tells a story of power and elegance. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240207/rust_lunar2024_spear_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240207/rust_lunar2024_spear_04.jpg ROCKET LAUNCHER To celebrate the Year of the Dragon, we have created a beautiful dragon themed rocket launcher with both unique visuals and sound effects. Differing from Western culture, the Dragon in Chinese mythology is auspicious and supreme. Dragons have the great power to control weather elements, but most importantly, soar through the skies - much like your ejecting rockets. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240207/rust_lunar2024_rocketlauncher_01.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240207/rust_lunar2024_rocketlauncher_03.jpg The dragon rocket launcher is a reskin of the rocket launcher.

252490,BAGS TO RICHES,"BACKPACKS Backpacks have been one of Rust's most highly requested additions for several years, and what is a survival game without backpacks? This month, we're excited to bring you the small and large backpack, allowing players to carry more loot. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240129/rust_backpacks_hero_01.jpg Inventory space has become more scarce as more items have been added to Rust over the years. Small Backpack https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240131/rust_backpacks_04.jpg The small handmade backpack provides 12 slots & can be crafted for 50 cloth and five sewing kits at a T1 workbench. It is a default blueprint and will take 30 seconds to craft. Large Backback https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240131/rust_backpacks_06.jpg The military-grade backpack carries a whopping 28 storage slots and is uncraftable, found in military loot. How To Use Both are worn in the backpack slot and drop off your character on death. They can be looted on the ground (be careful if dropping one in a safe zone!) or from inside your own inventory. They take 3 seconds to pickup off the ground and despawn slower when filled with valuable items (up to 2 hours). Currently, there are no negative effects from using a backpack. NEW PLAYER REMAINS BACKPACK To help differentiate regular player remains from the new backpack models we’ve given the player remains a visual refresh. This new model has a new open and closed visual state so you can tell at a glance if a bag has been opened by anyone. There is also some visual debris around an opened bag if the bag has more than 3 items in it. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240129/rust_playerdeathremains_01.jpg METAL DETECTOR The new metal detector allows you to find metal objects hidden beneath the ground. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20240130/rust_metaldetector_01.jpg Use the green lights to find the general area of an object, then when the green lights are all fully lit, hold the right mouse button to start sweeping the ground more closely and illuminate the yellow lights. When all the yellow lights are also lit up, a flag will be placed. Dig this flag up with any melee tool and grab your treasure! Different areas of the world will yield different types of loot, for example, what you may find on the beach will be different than what you find at the roadside or fields. WEAPON CHANGES I've modified the animations for the SAP/SAR and they should feel a bit less floaty and more snappy when reloading and aiming. I've also reduced the additional recoil added while moving when using the SAP. Over the coming months I plan to take a look at each and every weapon and do another pass at balancing them. This means timings, handling, recoil, and aimcone. I'm not saying the changes will be drastic but I'm aware there are elements that need changing. Stay tuned. IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES HIGHLIGHTS Legacy Shelter Limit Players can now only have one shelter placed at any one time Safezone Warning When attempting to log out in a safe zone a warning now appears Compass Death Marker Death marker now appears on the compass UI Repair Cost Fix Some deployables such as the autoturret were unintentionally expensive to repair, this is now fixed. Rotate Doors Doors, hatches and embrasures can now be rotated while being deployed using R Ripe Ripeness Increased all plants ripe stage duration from 4h to 14h MILDER SCREEN POST PROCESSING A recurring community comment is the on-screen hurt, cold, warm and radioactive post-processing is hash, it impacts the screen too much. To address the comments we have made the post-processing more mild. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/02/2024/7r18/side%20by%20side%201-min%281%29.png https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/02/2024/6701/side%20by%20side%202-min.png Above are a few examples, you can find more here. REDUCING SERVER SIDE ENTITY COUNTS As mentioned in our start of the year blog post, memory usage is a key area of concern this year. One aspect I’ve been looking at lately is entity counts. Anything that gets networked in a Rust server is an entity, so every tree, building block, player, vehicle, etc. What might seem counterintuitive is that many Items in your inventory are also entities, specifically an entity we call a Planner. This is the blue sheet your player visually equips when they are deploying something (eg. a sleeping bag). Any Item that can be deployed in your inventory will have a corresponding Planner entity. This entity is created when the item is created, and will exist on the server (typically in the players hands or at the world origin if they are in a container) until that item is used or destroyed. We need this entity as it handles all the logistics of spawning the deployed version of the item. To illustrate how many entities this creates we looked a list of entities on Facepunch EU2 towards the end of the November wipe last year. Out of 362,299 entities, 32,455 of them were Planners and are the largest count of entity (the next larg...",1706813630,

252490,SURVIVING A DECADE,"10 YEARS OF RUST Servers are now wiped and Santa is packing up and clearing out the bodies, but we hope you enjoyed the Holiday Season. We're getting back to work after a couple of weeks off, which is why this blog is lighter than usual, but we're looking forward to the journey ahead in 2024! This year, we celebrated Rust's 10th Birthday, which has been an incredible journey. Rust is continuing to see year-on-year growth and for a 10 year old game, that's a rather impressive feat. At a glance, here are some key gameplay features we added in 2023: Industrial system Drones RF Detonated C4 Security Camera Player controlled turrets Pings Double horse saddle Missile silo monument Wipe event Building skins Sleeping bag limits Building upgrade effects Water refresh Tugboat Ferry Terminal monument Wounded info Chat emoji Attack helicopter Homing missile launcher Parachutes Armored hot-air balloon Above and below rail linking Underground train signals M4 shotgun Alongside a metric ton of improvements. Rust continues to be a labour of love from all of us at Facepunch, and we couldn't have done it without your passion and feedback. Rust has evolved around player feedback. It's not the game we initially set out to develop, but it's a game we're incredibly proud and passionate about to keep developing. Thank you for being an integral part of this incredible journey, we look forward to delivering updates for the years to come. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/01/2024/8X88/A_1M5fjc.jpeg If you're interested in learning more about Rust's history or a further look back at 2023, you can view the timeline here: https://rust.facepunch.com/rust10 MOVING FORWARD What can you expect from us in 2024? More of the same! Guaranteed monthly updates every first Thursday of the month, along with frequent fixes, quality of life changes, improvements and holiday events. Next Month On February 1st, we'll release the backpack update. Backpacks will be a new craftable attire, allowing the player to carry more items. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/101/01/2024/2h12/RustClient_5ddZwDq1tL.jpg Can't wait till February? Backpacks will be publicly playable on Staging next week, allowing everyone to test and give feedback. Next month we'll also limit the number of shelters players can have placed at any one time. Forwards We have a ton of content currently in development, and if you're keeping an eye on our commits page, you'll already know some of them. This year, you can expect to see new and revamped monuments such as the compound, a tutorial system for new players, motorcycles, revamped server listings UI, new weapons. A hot topic we see is improving the world and the environment. We have multiple patches lined up in 2024 to improve the world, creating unique buildable areas such as canyons and lakes and improving rivers. Procedurally generated caves, additionally, we'll be exploring and improving cliffs and rock formations. We also plan to address the defender's advantage of sea-based monuments and events like the cargo ship. We are to rework the harbours, and the cargoship will soon dock with the harbours. Outlined above is skimming the surface of only a few key features. We have a lot more planned. But what about? Performance? Performance is always an ongoing process. We're constantly adding and improving new features monthly, often hidden in changelogs. There is no magic button to increase performance. Instead, it is a slow process of small gains. Our immediate attention is on bringing memory usage down, which can provide a more stable and consistent FPS experience for some users. We've already got several improvements ready for internal testing and hopefully release in the coming month or two. This year, we'll be bringing onboard new hires with a strong focus on performance. We'll continue to share news on performance in our monthly development blogs. Global Rendering? We first announced Global networked bases in September. Global rendering aimed to reduce bases popping in, significantly increase the view distance of player structures and reduce some performance overhead when rendering bases. Immediately we ran into some issues, applied fixes, re-released, and ran into further problems, this process repeated a few times and then went into development limbo. It was clear to us that we pushed this out too soon, with a lack of internal testing. We're making time over the next two months to thoroughly test and evaluate global rendering with the hope of releasing it publically again in March. Pets? If you follow our public commits page, you'll know we worked on pets for several months and suddenly stopped. For several reasons, we halted this project, and it will not be released this year. Our goal is still to have pets in Rust, but we have several obstacles to overcome first. We're currently hiring a game AI programmer to join the Rust team to help improve our AI and eventually assist in pets development. Nexus? Again, if you follo...",1704394166,

252490,MERRY RUSTMAS!,"MERRY CHRISTMAS & HAPPY HOLIDAYS! From everyone at Facepunch, we'd all like to wish you a Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone! Rust and its DLC packs are currently on sale till the end of January with up to 50% off. The Christmas Event is once again live! If you haven't been around for this before, here's what you can expect: Every once in a while you will hear the sound of jingle bells. Run outside and look for a gift! Two gifts are spawned per player, in a radius of about 40m from where you are standing. Run up and bash it open to receive your Christmas presents. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. If you have enough small presents stashed, you can ""trade up"" to a medium or large. The contents of each present vary, but you'll find a mix of resources, weapons, and candy. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_giftboxes.jpg Once again, you will be able to find Santa hats and reindeer antlers, both of which can be worn and provide a decent amount of protection. There’s also a lickable candy cane club, and two types of stockings. If you hang a stocking inside your base when the jingle bells ring the stocking will fill up with loot. The larger stocking has a higher chance for better items and both last around 5-10 refills. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20201218/xmas2020_santasleigh.jpg The advent calendar is a craftable deployable available to everyone during the Christmas event.

252490,10 YEARS OF RUST,"RUST 10TH ANNIVERSARY This month marks Rust's 10th birthday. We’ll celebrate from today till the 16th of December with in-game birthday cake, hats, throwbacks and some new items. Rust has undergone significant evolution since its launch in 2013. It initially began within the Unity Engine 4, playable in a web browser. Later, a standalone version launched on Steam early access, the beginning of which is now known to most as Rust Legacy. With rocky foundations, a complete overhaul was done to what we have today, known as Rust reboot, or just Rust nowadays. Over the past ten years, Rust has sold over 16 million copies (not counting console). Rust Legacy 2013 https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/106/12/2023/8j73/59dc97fe534c22706b625619cb2ec6867553d321.jpg Rust exceeded everyone's expectations and has grown yearly for ten years. We have delivered monthly updates for ten years straight, as we continue to expand the Rust development team, we have no plans to stop providing you with guaranteed monthly updates. Rust Reboot 2015 https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/2n13/d20d177fe4242bcd178065a6c7bdb257f2b6c637.png Below are some exciting metrics we've achieved over the past 10 years. https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/107/12/2023/6c20/Q8DexdRx.jpeg If you're interested in learning more about Rust's history, you can view the timeline here: https://rust.facepunch.com/rust10 On behalf of everyone at Facepunch Studios, we'd like to wish you a Happy Holidays. In the January end-of-years blog, we'll discuss how 2023 has gone, what we've achieved, what we learned, and our upcoming plans for 2024. PINATA Take your best shot at the new Pinata deployable, available to be crafted for 500 wood. Destroying the Pinata will drop a random selection of goodies, remember to share with your teammates. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231208/pinata_01_alt.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231208/pinata_02.jpg CONFETTI CANNON Mark the occasion with the Confetti Cannon! Simply light the fuse and sit back while the confetti rains down. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231208/confetticanon_01.jpg LEGACY WOOD SHELTER Remember those first few hours of Legacy Rust? Farming resources for your first big base, and needing a place to call home in the meantime? The shelter was the answer. Now it's back! https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/legacyshelter_01.jpg The shelter comes with an included door, key lock and even a small radius of building privilege! The perfect start to your Rust journey. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/legacyshelter_03.jpg Shelters will decay naturally, provided the door isn't interacted with (by someone with a key or ownership of the shelter) at least once a day. Make sure you keep using your shelter in order to keep it! Shelters placed within a tool cupboard radius will use TC upkeep as normal. They can also be repaired with the hammer, the same as any other deployable. Hello! I'm Ian, the new Gameplay Programmer! I remember cowering in my shelter back in 2013 Rust. It's incredible knowing I'm giving new players the same experience I had back in the day by bringing Vincent's awesome model to life. I can't wait to bring you more in the future. LEGACY BOW DLC The legacy bow is a limited-time only store item which is only purchasable during the month of December. This bow skin pays homage to the first-ever bow model in Rust. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231207/legacybow_01.jpg LEGACY WOOD BUILDING SKIN Available now from the Rust store is the new Legacy Wood building skin, the first Wood building skin. Owning this skin will allow you to change the visuals of your wood tier base. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_01.jpg This skin is for sale at the Steam store. To use, simply equip your hammer tool, display the wheel, and enable building skins. This should reveal the skin's wheel on which you may choose Legacy Wood upgrade. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_05.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_15.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_04.jpg https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231204/frontier_buildingskin_12.jpg M4 SHOTGUN The M4 shotgun was first introduced way back in Rust Legacy in 2013. To celebrate 10 years of Rust, we've decided to revive it. The M4 is an uncraftable military-grade shotgun; unlike other shotguns, the M4 has a much stronger range attack. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231207/legacyshotgun_01.jpg The M4 shotgun is a rare drop in high-end loot crates. LEGACY FURNACE The Legacy Furnace is a free skin for the furnace based on the original model from 2013. https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20231207/legacyfurnace_01.jpg To earn the Legacy Furnace, simply play for 3+ hours during the month of December. The furnace will be automatically issued to your Steam Inventory to use! https://files.facepunch.com/Errn/1b0611b1/Rust10_LegacyFurna...",1701974798,

FANCYORB'S GLOBAL WARFARE Alright so as many of you may know FancyOrb did a huge event this summer involving tons of creators and their pals to do a Global Warfare event. The map was a replica of earth in its entirety. Every region was battling to maintain control of their territory and take control of others. Blood was shed, politics were fierce, and treaties were undermined. This epic story FancyOrb narrated shows exactly how events unfolded. 300% worth the watch! This event will take place again next summer even bigger and better. Stay tuned!
