Via the Fallout: London Twitter account, an update shared to the mod's Discord explained: ""There has been a lot of speculation regarding our upcoming release, and we wanted to open up and clear the air for our core supporters. The bottom line is that we've sent several builds over to GOG for QA testing and are waiting for the final green light.
