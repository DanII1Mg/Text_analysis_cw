Thanks for playing Stardew Valley! -Ape ːstardropː 1.6.9 Changelog: ### New content & features * If you lost an item that can't be found again, a new friend appears in the secret woods who can get it back (for a price). * You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. These are limited to one per pond and produce legendary fish roe. Each fish has a unique water color. * You can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture. * Items dropped in water now float for a short time, so you can collect them if you're quick or have a magnet ring. * Sam and Shane now have work portraits while working at JojaMart. * Slightly tweaked some dialogues. * Added new Easter eggs. * Added hidden cheat commands ### Balance changes * Blue grass no longer grows slower than normal grass. * Fruit tree growth is no longer blocked by grass and seed spots. * Pine trees now drop one extra wood when chopped down. * The initiation quest now counts wild slimes killed on the farm. * Thorns ring damage now stacks if you equip two of them, and monsters killed by a thorns ring now drop loot like regular kills. * With the Gatherer skill, the chance to double harvested forage now applies when using an iridium scythe too. * Son of Crimsonfish can now be caught during the night market. * Robin no longer constructs buildings during green rain in year 1. * Placing a bomb and then switching to a weapon no longer applies its enchantments to the bomb damage. * Added some items to shops: * Adventurer's Guild: Rusty Sword, Femur, Elf Blade, Steel Smallsword, Crystal Dagger, Obsidian Edge, and Work Boots. These unlock after you reach a certain mine level, regardless of whether you found them in a mine chest. * Marnie's shop: Cow Decal. * Hat mouse: Sports Cap. * Willy's shop: Advanced Iridium Rod. * Passing trains are now more likely to happen multiple times in the same session, but can no longer appear on consecutive days. * Willy's shop now opens on spring 2 in the first year even if you didn't read his letter. * Fixed Queen of Sauce reruns being affected by the recipes needed by unclaimed farmhands in empty cabins. * Fixed being able to receive monster damage while jumping down a mine shaft before the screen fades to black. * Fixed spa not fully recovering energy when a max-energy buff is active. * Fixed sleeping late while exhausted not reducing stamina as intended. * Fixed the catalogue and Furniture Catalogue selling items from themed catalogues like Retro Catalogue. * Fixed exploit where a fish pond with a golden cracker could produce unlimited output.

For PlayStation/Xbox players, (https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Achievements#Retroactive_achievements). * Fish ponds now show the number of roe or other output items to collect. * The wedding event now replays if you exit & reload the day. * The tailoring UI is now a bit more intuitive: slots that can't accept the held item are now disabled, and you can no longer pick up some items that can't be tailored. * Colored items like flowers now also sort by color. That avoids items being reordered randomly each time you sort your inventory. * You can now only sell books to the bookseller via the book purchase menu, not the trade-in menu. This reduces the chance of accidentally selling a book when trying to trade it in. * The collections tab now shows artifacts, gems, and minerals once they're donated to the museum (not as soon as you find it). * Clint now refills your watering can when upgrading it. * Tweaked save process to reduce the chance of corruption. * Anvils no longer accept parrot eggs if you can't re-roll their level yet. * Improved chatbox commands: * Chat commands are now case-insensitive. * Changed `/help` format to make room for more commands. * Added `/help` descriptions for `/emote`, `/mapScreenshot`, and `/unbanAll`. * Added consistent messages when you can't use a multiplayer-only or host-only command....",1730743076,
