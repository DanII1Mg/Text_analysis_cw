Unleash the wild within as you shapeshift into wolf, bear, or even a fire-breathing wyvern! Explore brand new Ascendancy Classes, an innovative league mechanic where you can craft your own dungeon, and a new Pinnacle endgame boss! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/7c155fcd07b04578e8c54a36617765153423aeea.png The Druid is a shape changing elemental spellcaster. Using the sacred Talismans, a new type of weapon, the Druid can call upon the power of Draiocht to transform into an animal. In his human form, the Druid wields magical staves to channel the powers of the earth and the natural world. Raise scorching volcanoes from the ground, conjure roots to ensnare enemies, or strike them with a powerful thunderstorm! Most of the Druid’s human-form skills last for a duration and aid his animal-form abilities in various ways. As a spellcaster, the Druid can also take advantage of a new Spell Totem skill, which creates a totem that automatically casts any chosen spell for a time. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/15e2c9d29daef9078afa997065ab9eef00d72d1b.png As a creature of the night, the wolf channels the energy of the Moon itself into a flurry of ferocious attacks. Fast and agile, it leaps forward to freeze its foes and rake them with vicious slashes. Being a true alpha, the wolf can also summon a pack of minions to fight alongside it. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/980bac5d291dd93877bfb15ddbfe43404ec1c847.png A hulking powerhouse of strength and brawn, the bear rampages through its enemies, leaving devastation in its wake. By demolishing hordes of monsters, the bear builds up Rage that empowers its attacks and roars, ultimately turning it into a walking calamity. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/28387e600829a9dbc759993c0664014a49934c4a.png A sight seldom seen in Wraeclast, the wyvern leaps into combat and slashes at its enemies with lethal talons. Empowering itself by devouring the freshly dead, the wyvern calls down lightning explosions and spits balls of fire. Of course, it can also take to the skies and rain down streams of flame upon its foes. It is a dragon, after all. This Content Update also introduces two Ascendancy Classes for the Druid. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/3aa4603367f28852d1cef627ef47afbb9efa2382.png The Shaman channels nature’s fury, harnessing Rage to empower his Spells and becoming a walking natural disaster raining down Meteors, Lightning, and Ice. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/702d5d7fcf213290e5502c6e8349915fb85bf0b8.png The Oracle has perfected the power of Foresight, using it in combat to gain a massive advantage by peering into the future to predict a monster's movements and even allocate passives from alternate timelines! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/1312d6ed36882740e7ceb3f77d03b0557ef3f819.png Explore the opulent temple of Atziri, the Queen of the Vaal during the height of her power in the capital of the ancient empire.

2694490,Announcing The Third Edict Race Event,"Now that players have settled with the changes in The Third Edict, it's time for some more Path of Exile 2 racing action starting from the 5th of October PDT! While the races are open to everyone, the purpose of them is to crown players that are willing to prove themselves against others. With an overhaul to skill and support gems as well as a whole new Act filled with tons of new bosses, the next race is sure to be a thrilling watch! In this season's set of events, players will compete to be the first to kill Tavakai in Act 4 in a Solo Self-Found Rise of the Abyssal fixed layout environment. While this is not a Hardcore Event, players will incur a penalty upon death where they will not be able to move until a two and a half minute period has lapsed. It will also be the first race to include the new Abyssal league content! We'll be posting the ladder links below (when they're ready) so you'll be able to check who's leading in real-time during each race, or check the best times after the race to see how you fare against the top players. In order to join, click the ""Join"" button for the race in the Character Select screen. You'll then be prompted to create a character. Once you've spawned in, you won't be able to move your character until the race starts. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/83f55579b0f4a1b97c01c86a745b00efd961d601.jpg These races will be open to PC and Console with a shared prize pool. Event Times and Dates Race 1: October 5th 12PM PDT Race 2: October 12th 12PM PDT Race 3: October 19th 12PM PDT We suggest that you join the races early, as each race will start at the same time for all players. Prizes The Demigod's Virtue Unique item will be up for grabs for the top placement of each class: Ranger Sorceress Witch Monk Warrior Mercenary Huntress This means in each race, seven Demigod's Virtues will be awarded. Future events will include other classes when they're added to Early Access. As we do more race events in the future, we'll cycle through all the Demigod's items. They'll eventually represent an entire armour set including weaponry, so you might be able to collect the entire set if you're good enough! Upon the conclusion of each race, a Remove-Only stash tab will be added in your core leagues where you can choose to remove the item from the tab to equip it, show it off, link it to others or keep it there as a trophy for the ages. Or you can trade it away if you don't care, your call! If you want to use it as a cosmetic, you'll be able to convert it into a microtransaction using the /convertracereward chat command. All future leagues will have this Remove-Only stash tab too, but they will only become available one month into the league. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/d0b42b7d47c44b822da24dcd08df1b8fc6ab29e5.jpg We're also awarding more prizes in this set of races!

Finally, a Divination Card design will be awarded to the fastest player out of all three races. Rules These races are free to participate in and anyone is welcome to join. Streaming your POV will not be mandatory for this event. There are no limitations to how many races you can join, which means you will be able to win multiple Demigod's Virtues if you're skilled enough! Please note that the use of inappropriate character names (i.e. those that breach our Terms of Use) during your run will result in you being disqualified from participating in that event or future race events in the series. If you plan to stream your run, these rules will also apply to throw-away stream names for those that are streaming on alternate channels. Please also note that any character names that appear to be attempting to subtly skirt the rules or get around them while still being generally appropriate will count as a breach in this instance. If you want to play it safe, just use your regular stream/race names that people regularly know you by. If you're using an alt to obscure your strategy, that's okay but please keep the above rules in mind. Grinding Gear Games staff will be excluded from winning prizes in these events. Where to Watch Each of these races will be hosted live on twitch.tv/pathofexile with shoutcasting by ZiggyD and RaizQT. Co-streaming is welcome! Good luck to everyone who is planning to participate! We can't wait to see how old strategies fair with the new Act, or if new strategies will come out on top!",1759100926,
2694490,Major Endgame Changes in Patch 0.3.1 for Path of Exile 2,"As you know, the improvements to the endgame are a big focus of our next 0.4.0 content update for Path of Exile 2. However, we realised that it might be better to introduce some of the mechanical changes to the endgame sooner than that. Next week, we are planning to release Patch 0.3.1 with major changes and improvements to the endgame. Watch the video below! The video covers the broad strokes of the changes coming to the Endgame in 0.3.1, but there are other changes and details that will be important. Below we are covering some of the additional changes included in this patch. Alchemy Orbs With the introduction of tiered currency in 0.3.0, Alchemy Orbs became less valuable and had fewer uses. To give them more function and to smooth out the process of crafting your Maps, Alchemy Orbs can now be used on magic items. This will upgrade the magic item into a rare with 4 new random modifiers. Towers and Tablets As your tablets are now directly applied to your Maps, this means that you can now apply the content you desire to every single Map you run (assuming you have the tablet supply). However, the ceiling for the amount of content you can apply to a single Map has been lowered. Overall this results in a more streamlined and consistent experience, but in order to not have the ceiling come down too far, we’ve buffed the modifiers on Tablets. Generally the modifiers are approximately two to three times as powerful. Here's a few examples: Collector's now has a value of 10% to 30% increased Rarity of Items found in your Maps (from 7% to 10%) Teeming now has a value of 25% to 70% increased Magic Monsters (from 15% to 25%) of Strongboxes now has a value of 50% to 100% increased chance for your Maps to contain Strongboxes (from 30% to 50%) We have also added a few new modifiers: of the Devoted - Area contains an additional Shrine of the Antiquarian - Area contains an additional Strongbox Crystallised - Area contains an additional Essence Exiled - Area is inhabited by 1 additional Rogue Exile Azmeri's - Area contains 1 additional Azmeri Spirit Summoner's - Area contains an additional Summoning Circle of the Summoning - Area has 25 to 50% increased chance to contain a Summoning Circle And here’s some other pieces of information to know about Tablets: Unique tablets have their own individual number of uses When using Tablets in the reforging bench, the resultant item will have the sum of the input tablets as its remaining number of uses. However this value cannot exceed the original maximum value When in an inventory like your personal one or a stash, the number of uses remaining on each Tablet can be seen on the bottom right of its icon Existing Tablets that have been applied to your Atlas will remain and you will not lose any value due to these changes Map Size Some Maps took considerably longer than others to navigate or complete, so we've reduced the size of the following Maps: Augury Bastille Blooming Field Channel Epitaph Fortress Grimhaven Hidden Grotto Oasis Penitentiary Rupture Savannah Slick Vaal City Wetlands Atlas Trees As a result of changes such as every Map now containing a Boss, we’ve had to make some modifications to the Atlas Tree. For example, the Crystal Realm notable on the Map Boss Tree, which previously added an additional Essence to areas containing a Map Boss, now only applies to areas with Powerful Map Bosses. Note this results in effectively no change; it is the same amount of Essences before and after. In general the Map Boss Tree applies to all Map Bosses, with only a select few notables now specifically applying to Maps with Powerful Map Bosses. For example, the Fit for a King notable applies to all Map Bosses. Additionally you’ll notice a number of other nodes changing throughout the core Atlas Tree to account for mechanical changes around Towers. We’ve tried to make sure these are kept approximately the same before and afterwards, so your Atlas Trees will remain the same. Citadels Citadels have had their spawn rate increased by 66%. Other Improvements Modifiers that cause the area to be covered in Chilled/Shocking/Ignited Ground now cause much less ground to be covered. At least 66% of the ground effects currently covering the ground will be removed, this value is higher on lower tier Waystones. We have fixed a few problems where Map Boss difficulty was not applying to many multi-form Bosses, so a few of the Maps with Deadly Map Bosses will now be more difficult as a result. It was always pretty odd that the second and third phases of some of these Bosses had ten-times less life than the first phase, this was an unintentional mistake. Alongside the changes mentioned above, the patch contains various improvements and fixes to a plethora of issues. All the details will be covered in the full patch notes, which we'll post as soon as we can. Stay tuned!",1758831688,

2694490,The Third Edict: What We're Working On,"With the launch of Path of Exile 2: The Third Edict over the weekend, we've been keeping a close eye on feedback and issues that have been arising (along with the Abyssal). We've released 13 Hotfixes since launch and are currently working on the 0.3.0b patch, which will fix a lot of outstanding issues including the Warbringer's totem Ascendancy Notable. We expect to release it by the end of the week. Here are some highlights from the patch: Rise of the Abyssal Changes Abyssal Monsters can now be bound as Spectres. The Vessel of Kulemak's Teleport Slam can no longer be avoided, and the damage it deals has been reduced. Improved the telegraphing for the Vessel of Kulemak's arena-wide cleave. The cleave has also been made easier to dodge in the final part of the fight. The ""Area is overrun by the Abyssal"" Map Modifier now spreads Pits over a larger amount of the area. The Strider of the Pit's Spear Slam now has a global cooldown, and they now stop tracking you with their Storm skill when you are far enough away. Reduced the damage of the Crystal Wall used by Abyssal Stranglers. Reduced the movement speed of the Shepherd of the Pit, and reduced the damage dealt by their ground effect. Improved the invulnerability visual effect for the Lightless Moray. The ignite chance and damage from its shade form explosion has also been reduced. Abyssal Monsters now introduce some of their skills over the first 3 Acts instead of being able to use all of their skills from Act 1. Removed the motion blur effect played when Abyssal Pits closed. Other Changes and Improvements One-time Rare Monsters found in the Campaign no longer have their fixed hidden modifiers when used as tamed beasts, or spectres. You will no longer remain locked onto enemies while sprinting. This improves cases where you would sprint away from an enemy then unintentionally turn around to use a skill targeting that enemy. You can now use Instance Management (Ctrl+click) on the button to jump in the Well of Souls. You can now use /hideout and similar commands from the Well of Souls. Map areas now have versions with no Map Boss present. Vendor windows will now remember any search text you've entered on a per NPC basis, until you exit to character selection. Boss fights with two bosses should now correctly restart from the beginning when a player Resurrects at Checkpoint after killing just one boss. The Soul Siphoner monster modifier has been reworked. The inner ring now reduces damage dealt, and the outer ring reduces Skill Speed for each time you use a Skill while standing in it. Both rings deal Physical Damage over Time (previously both rings prevented Mana recovery, drained Mana and dealt Lightning Damage over time). Forge Hammer no longer costs mana when used to recall the Hammer, and other skills such as Warcries cannot empower that use. Doedre's Dark Design, triggered by the Doedre's Undoing Support, now deals Spell Damage instead of Secondary Damage. Added missing Duration and Ground Effect types to the His Foul Emergence Skill to allow it to function with relevant support gems. Temporarily disabled the following Rogue Exiles: Taua, the Ruthless, Ulfred, the Afflicted, Drusian, the Artillerist, and Doran, the Deft. The Derelict Mansion Map Boss arena no longer requires finding a tome to open. The boss arena in Derelict Mansion Map will now be open if you die to the bosses after opening it once. The Razed Fields Map no longer stops you from entering the boss arena after it has been started. The barrier outside the church in Arastas can no longer be broken early. Improved the telegraphing of Yama the White's future sight skill. Increased the cooldown for some of Torvian, Hand of the Saviour's skills. The projectile speed of their bouncing axe skill has been reduced, and the amount of freeze build up Torvian causes when under the effects of the Twilight Order's Sword buff has been reduced. The Scourge of the Skies bird storm skill can no longer be avoided. The slam combo skill used by Kurtog, Lord of Kin can no longer be avoided. Some of the skills used by Great White One can no longer be avoided. The tracking of Azmadi, the Faridun Prince's triple lacerate skill is now more lenient. You can now use portals after defeating Siora, Blade of the Mists. Oswin, the Dread Warden now removes all the debuffs he has applied to the player when he is killed. Reduced the likelihood of Treant Foulspawns firing projectiles whilst walking. Reduced the damage of Quill Crab's quill projectiles. Updated the description of Lifetap Support to clarify it turns a Supported Skills Mana cost into a Life cost, rather than stating ""a portion of"". Updated the Tabna's Pillar World Map Icon to correctly describe the benefits it provides. Updated the Navali's Rest World Map Icon to indicate it provides a permanent benefit. Corrected and simplified Meditate's description. This is purely a description change. Clarified the Skill Description for Infernal Cry to indicate that it only Empow...",1756870705,

2694490,Asynchronous Trade FAQ,"The launch of Path of Exile 2: The Third Edict will include the long awaited asynchronous trade system, which will also include a completely in-game market! In today's news post we've answered some of the most frequently asked questions about how this new system will work. When will I be able to convert my existing Premium Stash Tabs into Merchant’s Tab? Once 0.3.0 releases this Friday, you will be able to convert your Premium Stash Tabs purchased before the launch into Merchant’s Tabs from your account settings on the website. Just to clarify, the option to convert your Premium Stash Tab to a Merchant's Tab will be made available on the Path of Exile 2 website when the 0.3.0 patch is deployed on August 29th (PST). August 29th is not a deadline to convert your stash tabs by. When will the Merchant’s Tab be available in the store? Merchant's Tabs will be available for purchase in the Path of Exile 2 shop once The Third Edict releases this Friday. You will also have the option to convert Premium Stash Tabs purchased prior to the 0.3.0 release. Premium Stash Tabs purchased after 0.3.0 release cannot be converted. How much does the Merchant's Tab cost to buy? A single Merchant's Tab costs 40 points, and a bundle of six Merchant's Tabs will be available for 200 points. It will join the rest of the stash tabs on the stash tab sale rotation a month after release. Is there a limit to how many Merchant's Tabs I can have? No. Can I use my Merchant's Tabs in Path of Exile 1? The asynchronous trade system won't be immediately available in Path of Exile 1, so you won't be able to use your Merchant's Tabs there when Path of Exile 2: The Third Edict Launches. When this system is added to Path of Exile 1, any Merchant's Tabs you have purchased will also be available to use there. What happens to my Premium Stash Tabs in Path of Exile 1 when I convert them to Merchant's Tabs in Path of Exile 2? Once upgraded, a tab will no longer be accessible in Path of Exile 1 until Merchant's Tabs are supported there. Items stored in an upgraded tab will remain in a remove-only version of the original Premium Stash Tab. Will a free Merchant's Tab be provided to players? No. However, the existing methods of trading will still be available. Who pays the Gold cost when buying or selling items through a Merchant's Tab? The buyer pays a Gold cost when buying an item from a Merchant's Tab. There is no Gold cost for the seller to list or sell an item in a Merchant's Tab. How do I collect my earnings when an item is sold through a Merchant's Tab? To collect your earnings, talk to Ange in your hideout, select the Manage Shop option, and navigate to the ""Earnings Tab"", where you can withdraw the currency you have received from other players buying your items. The Earnings Tab is remove-only, so you cannot place items back into it after withdrawing them. If multiple players try to buy the same item at the same time, who gets it? The first player to complete the trade will get the item. Can Premium Quad Stash Tabs be converted to Merchant's Tabs? No. Can you set a buyout price for a whole Merchant's Tab of items, like you can with Premium Stash Tabs? No, you have to individually price each item. The interface does auto-fill with your last price however. Is it possible to essentially buy Gold using this system? No. Due to the Gold cost of buying items through this system, buying an item from a Merchant's Tab and selling it to a vendor for gold will not result in a net positive Gold outcome. Can you buy and sell currency items through a Merchant's Tab? No. A Merchant's Tab can only be used to buy and sell items that aren't available on the Currency Exchange. Can I change the price of an item or remove an item from the Merchant's Tab after listing it? Yes. But there is a cooldown on removing or changing the price to prevent abuse. There is a short grace period after initially adding the item before it will be listed in the trade index, and you are able to change your mind and delist the item during this time. Is this new system available on consoles? Yes. If I convert Premium Stash Tabs to Merchant's Tabs, will they still be available to use as Premium Stash Tabs in SSF leagues? No. Stash tabs are not league specific. Converting a tab converts it everywhere, and Merchant's Tabs are not available to be used in SSF leagues. We hope you enjoy trading with this new system! We're aware that the initial implementation of this system won't be perfect, so please be sure to let us know your feedback so we can look into making improvements. ",1756153197,
2694490,The Third Edict FAQ,"Yesterday, we announced The Third Edict, our next major Content Update for Path of Exile 2. In this news post, we’re answering the most frequently asked questions from our community regarding the upcoming update. When does the Third Edict launch on all platforms? The Third Edict will launch at 1PM August 29 PDT on all supported platforms, including the standalone PC client, Steam and Epic Games Store clients as well as Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. Will there be an economy reset? Yes. Your existing characters will be kept and still available to play in the Standard Early Access leagues, but the new Rise of the Abyssal league will have a fresh economy. The new league has new content and features and it’s highly recommended that you play there. If you do decide to use your old character, just note that due to extensive balance changes, it is possible you will need to reallocate passive points, and the functionality of certain elements of your build might have changed. How do I start playing in a new league? When creating a character, select the Rise of the Abyssal banner. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/3e3510eb6c5f13fa1f8981bb8b4956e95e1f6339.jpg Is there a special in-game mechanic that is available only in the Rise of the Abyssal league and not in the core game? Yes, the Rise of the Abyssal league has its own exclusive mechanics, content, rewards and bosses not available in the core game. After the league is complete, we will decide which of these features will make it into the core game. Do I need to create a new character and start the game from the beginning? Yes, if you want to play the Rise of the Abyssal League. However, you can continue playing your existing characters in the Early Access league if you wish/ With the introduction of Act Four and the Interlude, where do I continue if I want to play my existing character in the Standard Early Access league? If your Standard character has already reached the Endgame, you can continue playing there. Your character will lose some quest rewards that previously granted resistances, but your Spirit and Attributes values will remain unchanged. In some cases, your passive tree may need to be reallocated if you allocated points that have been removed. If you’d like to experience Act Four and the Interlude content, just go back to Act Three town, then talk to Alva to travel to Act Four. In case you hadn’t reached the Endgame and were playing on Cruel difficulty prior to the release of Third Edict, your character will be transferred to the end of Act Three where you can continue into Act Four. All previously earned quest rewards will remain unchanged. What happens to my stash tabs if I start in a new Rise of the Abyssal league? Any stash tabs you have purchased will be available to use in the Rise of the Abyssal leagues. Since a new league is a fresh economy, your stash in the new league will not contain any items from your stash in other leagues. All the items will be in Remove Only stash tabs in the Standard leagues. Speaking of stash tabs, when will I be able to convert my existing Premium Stash Tabs into Merchant’s Tab? Once 0.3.0 releases next Friday, you will be able to convert your Premium Stash Tabs purchased before the launch into Merchant’s Tabs from your account settings on the website. Just to clarify, the option to convert your Premium Stash Tab to a Merchant's Tab will be made available on the Path of Exile 2 website when the 0.3.0 patch is deployed on August 29th (PST).

You will also have the option to convert Premium Stash Tabs purchased prior to the 0.3.0 release. Premium Stash Tabs purchased after 0.3.0 release cannot be converted. August 29th is not a deadline to convert your stash tabs by. Is this a paid expansion? No. If you’re an existing Path of Exile 2 player, all you have to do is to download the content update. With the launch of The Third Edict on August 29th, Path of Exile 2 will be available for free for three days. If you've been thinking about trying the game, this weekend is the perfect time!

2694490,Path of Exile 2: Content Update Timeline,"Now that Path of Exile 1 has had its league, it’s time to talk about our plans for when the next Path of Exile 2 Content Update will be released! Path of Exile 2 has a lot of new players, so we thought it would be a good idea to explain how our updates work. Major updates for Path of Exile 2 are released every 4 months. Since 0.2.0 was in April, that means the next one will be in August, and the one after that will be in December. Our big updates, including the one coming in August include a new League. Leagues are a fresh economy for you to experience the new content update in, but they also have exclusive content that is only available in the league. Leagues usually contain a new combat mechanic, new rewards, new crafting options and new bosses. During the league, the new content will usually appear in every area, giving you a new experience while playing through the game. After the league ends, we then have a chance to work out how we will integrate the content from the league into the base game, meaning it’s a great way to introduce new things while still giving us a chance to fix any problems before they are in the game forever. After the league is finished, all your characters and items will transfer to the Standard leagues where you can continue to play them, but most players usually want to play in the next league. Of course, our content updates always contain a lot of new stuff for the base game as well. As Path of Exile 2 is still in Early Access, we have a lot of content that we haven't finished yet, and there is certainly a lot of new stuff coming! Now for the date. 0.3.0 will be released on August 29th (PDT). It’s a little later in the month than we had hoped, but this is a big update, and there were a few other constraints we had to work around. We will be announcing the content of the release around one week beforehand. We look forward to showing you guys what we have been cooking up! ",1752191089,

2694490,Skill Sound Design in Path of Exile 2,"Patch 0.2.1 for Path of Exile 2 introduced several new Unique Items, including the Last Lament. This Unique Crossbow quickly caught players' attention—not just for its in-game power, but also for its distinctive visual design and unique sound. In this news post, our Senior Sound Designer Dominic dives into the process behind creating skill sound for the Last Lament. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hi, I’m Dominic Downing, Senior Sound Designer at Grinding Gear Games. I joined the team at the start of 2020. Delirium was my first league I worked on, and I had to figure out joining the team mid-pandemic… it was a wild time! These days, I handle skill and combat audio for Path of Exile alongside another talented sound designer. In this post, I’ll take you behind the scenes of skill audio design in Path of Exile 2, from concept to implementation. Why Skill Audio Matters Skills are part of the core of Path of Exile’s gameplay, and sound plays a huge role in reinforcing what they do and how they feel. A well-designed skill sound can signal danger, enhance impact, or even invoke safety. For example, a player casting Detonate Dead shouldn’t sound as threatening to the player as a monster with the Detonate Dead rare monster modifier; you need to feel the difference. The Design Process Understanding the Skill We work closely with designers and animators to understand what a skill does, its damage type, area of effect, whether it does damage over time, offers utility, and so on. Since we use our own engine, we are easily able to work with programmers to build or improve systems for audio integration. It’s a very collaborative process. Some examples: being able to tell if a grenade is in the air, rolling, or bouncing, or if a skill is going to repeat in quick succession because of another in-game mechanic, like Barrage. It’s also important to test each skill in-game with a variety of character builds to ensure the audio holds up in all kinds of scenarios. Source Material Most of our sounds are a blend of recorded Foley (sometimes even our voices), library assets, and synthesis. For things like vocal layers, cloth movement, or rocks, we can easily jump into the sound booth to record unique elements. It’s a lot of fun and a great excuse to be a bit crazy without judgment! Synthesis is a fun and powerful way to create sounds, and I often use my Eurorack setup for this. Eurorack is a form of modular synthesis that lets you build a synth or sound from the ground up. Using white noise and creative filtering, modulated with Erica Synths’ Joystick 2, I can produce movement of the sound for each skill, creating some of the windy textures you’ll hear in some of the wind skills. Modules like Schlappi Engineering’s 100 Grit and Make Noise’s Wogglebug are perfect for creating noisy, electrical textures, great for lightning-based skills. And for tonal, bell-like sounds, ideal for elemental magic, I often turn to the Rings module from Mutable Instruments. Recording weird, unexpected sounds like these is honestly one of the best parts of the job. Prototyping & Testing You don’t know how a sound works until it’s in the game. As I mentioned earlier, we test skills early on, across different builds, areas, and support gems. Randomisation and layering help keep sounds fresh and immersive. But getting sounds into the game as soon as possible during development is key. This way, we catch issues early and avoid spending too much time polishing something that doesn’t fit with gameplay. It’s better to create quick drafts, test them in-game, and make small tweaks than to perfect something upfront, only to discover major changes are needed later. We also have to manage technical limits like voice count (which is the maximum amount of sounds that can play at any time) and cooldowns (which is how soon a sound can play again after already playing). For example, if a skill fires multiple projectiles with the same sounds playing simultaneously, we need to make sure the audio doesn’t overload or cut out. And when you’re playing in a party, we consider how skill sounds affect other players; should your skill sound just as epic to them as it does to you? Implementation We use FMOD, plus internal tools bespoke to Path of Exile. Over time, these tools have evolved based on direct feedback. I’ll think, “man, I wish I could just do X”, and our programming teams will make it a reality. It’s a dream! Clarity in the Ruckus Combat in Path of Exile can be a ruckus, so we always ask: what’s most important for the player to hear? Audio needs to guide, not overwhelm. We balance sounds through mixing, making sure everything fits together without getting too loud or quiet. We use a technique called ‘ducking’ to lower less important sounds, so key sounds stand out. Distance attenuation makes sounds quieter as they get farther away, helping create a sense of space. And priority systems decide which s...",1750291133,

2694490,Chase Uniques in 0.2.1,"In recent patches we have had the goal to make the experience of item drops a lot more satisfying, but an area that we didn't address yet is finding chase Uniques. It's time to change that! In 0.2.1 we are significantly changing the way uniques drop and adding some great new Chase Uniques as well! Unique Item Drop Changes When we design Uniques we classify them into a few different rarities depending on how powerful we think they are. These are called “Common”, “Uncommon”, “Rare” and “Mythic”. Mythic Uniques are things like Headhunter, Mjolner or Astramentis. Mythic uniques are intended to be chase, but they were way too rare. The first problem is that we balanced the relative number of Rare and Mythic uniques the same as it was in PoE1, but in PoE1 you get way more uniques. The second problem is that in PoE2, when you roll for uniques, the game first rolls what Item Class the unique will come from. This means that things like Amulets and Rings were significantly less common than other types of uniques. A mythic amulet like Astramentis was about 47,000x rarer than a divine orb. When things are that rare they effectively don’t exist for most players. There are some cool items to find, but you are not going to find them. The first change we made to bring this in line was to remove the Item Class from the equation. Astramentis is now the same rarity as a weapon like Mjolner. The second change was to make it so Common uniques get less common as more Rarity is added to maps, meaning that there is more chance for Uncommon, Rare and Mythic uniques. And the last change was to just massively buff the number of Mythic Uniques that drop. These changes together should significantly improve the feeling that a good unique could be round any corner. We have also improved the power of a few uniques that were classified as mythic, but were not really holding up to a “Mythic” standard. You will have to wait for the patch to find out what those are! But in the mean time, here are a couple of examples of new Mythic uniques that we are adding in 0.2.1. Unique Item Previews The first item is a Unique Bow that might be familiar to seasoned players, Lioneye's Glare. Instead of our designers telling you about this item, Lioneye himself will, by recounting the battle of his Legion versus the fearsome Karui lead by Kaom. Check it out below: If you're interested in our comics, you can purchase digital copies here.

2694490,Patch 0.2.1 New Crafting Socketables Preview,"As we mentioned in our plan for Patch 0.2.1 last week, we'll be adding a plethora of new crafting socketables in the endgame. The socketables system is one of the many crafting systems available in Path of Exile 2. The idea is for them to help you out during your campaign progression to fill out any missing attributes or resists that you might be lacking. After you've progressed into the Endgame and fill out those stats in your gear, they can be swapped out for different stats like damage or defence so that you can min/max your character. However, one of the issues that we currently have with the socketable crafting system is that by the time you get to the endgame there isn't really anything new or exciting to find to replace your old runes. In 0.2.1 we are adding 22 new Runes. All of these new Runes will be world drops only, which means you won't be able to upgrade any existing Runes to get them. Here are a few examples that speak for themselves: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/18126d1f0faa35d1ccb2c2f3e41330ddb443be2a.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/03e638ad21fb0173932f384678bb60723f69c1b2.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/a3197e2348c9e003e74b4045867d5298089a69af.jpg This is 1 of the 14 new Soul Cores, Tacati's Soul Core of Affliction. Soul Cores can be found in Endgame Ultimatum encounters in the Trial of Chaos. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/f8a636b7dd193b72f072b28e1bf6f7648cefc7e9.jpg Lastly, here's 1 of the 7 new Talismans, the Talisman of Thruldana. These new Talismans can be dropped from Azmerian Spirit-possessed enemies. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/70bda3a63dc1a1c2ec5e1b1be8160d700ea0ce10.jpg As you can see from the crafting socketables we've shown above, the power ceiling from socketables is being raised. As these are also intended to be valuable chase drops, you shouldn't expect to find these trivially. These are rare, and they are intended to be mid to long term character upgrades that you can do incrementally as you play deeper and deeper into the Endgame. We've got a lot more coming in Patch 0.2.1, which we're still working on. Later this week, we'll also show off some of the new Unique Items that will also be released in the update. Despite our attempts to have 0.2.1 ready for deployment this week, we do need a little bit of extra time so we have shifted it to the following week.",1748306453,
2694490,Upcoming Plans for Patch 0.2.1,"We’re continuing to work on improvements for Path of Exile 2. Patch 0.2.1 is in active development and we're aiming to deploy it at the end of next week. Find out more about the improvements this patch contains below! Endgame Rewards When setting up the frequency of encounters and rewards for Path of Exile 2, we have to decide how many maps players will have to do in order to get them. After extensive playtesting we now believe that we overshot this number pretty substantially. In 0.2.0g we improved the base-line experience of getting rewards from monsters and chests but we still feel you don't get enough of those exciting spike moments when something very powerful or valuable drops. There actually are some very cool items to find, but you won't ever find them because they are incredibly rare. One of the major focuses of 0.2.1 is making chase items more common, but also adding more chase items to find. Unique Items In 0.2.1 we are going to be significantly improving both the drop rates of the incredibly rare unique items we already have as well as adding a bunch of new exciting and chase uniques that will take your builds to new heights. We are also buffing some of the rarer uniques that were intended to be chase, but didn't live up to that standard. You should see significantly more chase uniques than before and we'll be doing a post showing some of the new uniques next week! Crafting Socketables One of the issues that we have with the socketable crafting system at the moment is that by the time you get to the endgame there isn't really anything new or exciting to find to socket in your gear. Resists and attributes are great to help with solving problems in the early game, but in the endgame, ideally you should be swapping all of these out for more interesting and powerful mods. In 0.2.1 we are adding 22 new Runes, 14 new Soul Cores and 7 new Talismans. These cover a full spectrum from being powerful to insane, but are rare to find. You will certainly want to use them over the normal base set of socketables. Ritual Ritual also suffered from us pitching the chase rewards too rare as well. We're making the rarer Omens from Ritual more common. You'll see the same number of Omens, but they have a significantly higher probability of being the rarer, more exciting ones. Corrupted Essences While we're at it, we'll also be increasing the commonality of getting Corrupted Essences when using Vaal Orbs on monsters trapped in Essences, by approximately six times. Rogue Exiles Rogue Exiles just didn't have enough Unique Items so we are increasing the frequency that Rogue Exiles have, and thus drop, Unique Items by approximately three times. Twisted Domain The boss in the Twisted Domain was pretty valuable, but as an endgame area, the rest of it was pretty underwhelming compared to the other content you are doing at the time. Pinnacle content shouldn't be giving less rewards than the dozens of maps required to gain access to it. To start with we have substantially increased the number of Rare monsters that spawn during the Domain. Previously there would often be no Rare monsters at all. In addition, we have changed the balance of Quantity and Rarity that monsters in the Domain have. This will mean that the large drop of items that occurs right before the boss fight should now be way more valuable than before. We now also guarantee some rare Breach Rings in the resulting drop, so you should come away with at least a decent chance of some powerful items. Expedition Logbooks One thing that makes Logbooks unrewarding is the fact that at very high levels they have so few monsters spawning that they often end up yielding significantly less items than just a regular Endgame Map. This is reflected in the fact that at low level 90s you could do an entire Level 80 (the highest possible level) Logbook and not even gain 1% of a level of experience. We're doing a pass on the amount of monsters spawning to intensify the combat but focusing on very high level ones to better match the consistency of other Endgame content. The first change is that we're increasing the distance between explosives and the radius of explosives, this will allow you to ultimately uncover more monsters and rewards. On top of this we're also increasing the number of monsters spawned to be more reflective of what an Endgame map has in it. Additionally we're also making changes to the specific features found in each of the different Logbook areas. The Lush Isle area currently has Karui Totem Remnants that cause the monsters to give substantially increased experience. It also has fenced off areas where you can explode the fence and gain access to totems that drop a lot of currency items and on the beaches there are small corruption pustules that drop Uncut Skill Gems. In order to improve this area we are increasing the number of Remnants, especially the experience ones. Additionally we will generate more of the fenced off sections, and a larger change to the pust...",1747871893,

2694490,0.2.0h Patch Summary,"We discussed our plans for 0.2.0h last week but wanted to give a more complete breakdown of what you can expect in this update. Private Leagues We plan to enable Private Leagues when 0.2.0h releases using the Path of Exile 1 website for now. There will be no extra mods available for these Private Leagues but we'll be expanding the functionality of them soon. We wanted to get the ability to create Private Leagues released sooner rather than later for those that want to start over in a fresh economy by themselves or with their friends. Quick-Use Currency Buttons on Strongboxes and Essences We've added Quick-Use buttons that appear below the labels of Strongboxes and Essences. For Strongboxes, the currency displayed is dynamic based on the state of the Strongbox and is only displayed if that currency is in your inventory. As an example, if the Strongbox is unidentified it will only display a Wisdom Scroll. If it is Normal Rarity it will display an Orb of Transmutation, if it has one magic modifier it will display an Orb of Augmentation. It will also be able to have buttons for Orbs of Alchemy, Exalted Orbs, and Regal Orbs. We have intentionally not included currency like Divine Orbs as that would be a mistake to use. Essences have also received the same change but with Vaal Orbs for corrupting them into the Corrupted Essences. Breach Improvements Breach had significant issues with spawning monsters in very narrow or tight areas. It was expected to be worse in those areas because you can only fit so many monsters in a given space. This made Breach encounters worse than we wanted and resulted in a very boring experience where you felt like you failed even though there was little you could do about it. We've made a change to how monsters spawn in Breaches to be more reliable. This drastically raises the minimum experience of a Breach encounter. Additionally we have changed the minimum time of a Breach, assuming no monsters are killed, to 20 seconds from 12 seconds. We have also made the time extension granted by killing monsters account for Monster Power. This means if you kill Magic or Rare enemies during the Breach it will extend the time more than killing Normal monsters. Previously we spoke about dropping fewer stacks of Splinters in larger quantities, but instead of that we're making a more drastic improvement. We will now vacuum up all the Breach Splinters dropped during a Breach encounter and drop them at your location when the Breach concludes. If you are in a party it will drop multiple stacks that are randomly allocated. Azmerian Wisp Improvements Azmerian Wisps have received two changes. The first is that when you activate a second Wisp, while pursuing one already, that Wisp will now always target the same Rare monster as the one you were already chasing. This was uncommon during the Campaign and mostly presented itself in Endgame especially with Atlas Tree investment but when it did happen, you would lose one of those Wisps commonly which felt purely negative. The other change is that the Spirit of the Spring Hare and Spirit of the Fox were far too rare, we've made these three times more common. They can create some pretty hectic and rewarding outcomes and we wanted to give more opportunities to encounter these and their rewards. Rogue Exile Visibility Improvements Rogue Exiles had one main issue. Often you would be clearing through a Map and all of a sudden have a large life bar on the top of your screen with no connection to a boss or monster. This was because the Rogue Exiles had a very large aggro range. We've reduced this aggro range so they are far more commonly on-screen before it appears, that way you see them before the life bar presents itself. If you were to hit them off-screen using projectiles or other skills, they'll still aggro immediately though. The second issue is that even when you did find one and they were on-screen, you could barely see them especially in darker maps. In order to alleviate this we have both added Minimap Icons to them once they've engaged combat, and we've made the light on them far brighter to help them stand out and be more obvious when surrounded by other enemies. Further Item Drop Improvements We did a major patch to update overall loot drops but there are still some outliers we're working on improving. In 0.2.0h we're going to be making Perfect Jeweller's Orbs and Level 20 Uncut Skill and Spirit Gems significantly more common. These will still be relatively rare but it was often the case people would get very far into their Endgame and character progression before even finding one. Item Labels Additions to Important Items For those not using custom Item Filters and were in Endgame you might have observed some more important items not being obvious enough. We have added outlines to the labels for Precursor Tablets, Expedition Logbooks and Expedition Chests to help them stand out when you have many other items on the ground around them. Shrine Improvements We'...",1747108237,
2694490,Upcoming Plans for Patch 0.2.0h,"We’re currently planning the 0.2.0h update for Path of Exile 2 which contains several quality of life features and will address certain aspects of Endgame content. We’re planning to release this patch by the end of next week. The main focus of the patch is to improve certain aspects of the Endgame. This includes the minimum experience of Breaches where far too few monsters spawn and the Breach doesn't last long enough. We will also reduce the number of small Breach splinter stacks dropping and instead have fewer, larger stacks dropping. We'll also be adding improvements to the visibility of Rogue Exiles, and will improve the behaviour of Azmerian Wisps when you activate two at once. Another big focus is to add in some Quality of Life features. One example is that we'll be adding some UI Icons for Strongboxes and Essences that will let you quickly use currency from your inventory without needing to open it. This feature will also work with Vaal Orbs for Essences. Here's a preview: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44770983/34dd7251d13c2b484d59640f415f966d6270fb0c.jpg We've got a few other Quality of Life changes planned, which we'll talk about more next week. A big request that we've had is to make Unidentified Item Tiers filterable. This change will be coming in 0.2.0h so you'll be able to filter by and change how your Unidentified Tier 1-5 Magic and Rare items look when the patch is released. We also plan to add two new Stash Tabs: the Ritual Tab and Socketable Tab. The Ritual Tab holds your Omens and Audiences with the King, while the Socketable Tab will hold your Runes, Talismans and Soul Cores. You'll be able to upgrade your Runes from within the Socketable Tab. Lastly, we plan to enable Private Leagues when 0.2.0h releases using the Path of Exile 1 website for now. There will be no extra mods available for these Private Leagues but we'll be expanding the functionality of them soon. We wanted to get the ability to create Private Leagues released sooner rather than later for those that want to start over in a fresh economy by themselves or with their friends.

2694490,A Path Of Exile 2 patch was meant to turn on the loot tap but it started deleting players' skills instead,"Demon-swarmed fantasy ARPG <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2"">Path Of Exile 2</a> got a patch today that should have, in theory, increased the rarity of loot dropped for players across all parts of the game. Instead, the game began deleting their <a href=""https://pathofexile2.wiki.fextralife.com/Skill+Gems"">Skill Gems</a> - the extremely important stones that players use to perform all manner of attacks, spells, and defensive magicks. The developers quickly shut down the servers and rolled back the game, leading to a five-hour outage and a bunch of players who are now even more annoyed than they have been in recent weeks. And trust me, that is <em>annoyed</em>. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-path-of-exile-2-patch-was-meant-to-turn-on-the-loot-tap-but-it-started-deleting-players-skills-instead"">Read more</a> ",1746106243,
2694490,Item Changes in Path of Exile 2,"One of the things that we have had a lot of feedback about is item drops feeling unrewarding in various situations. Over the last two weeks we have done a major rework to item drops in order to try and address these issues. We are going to be deploying these changes in 0.2.0g later today. Item Rarity In order to control the items that monsters drop, they primarily have two stats added to them. Monster Item Quantity is a stat that increases the number of items that are dropped. Monster Item Rarity on the other hand determines how good the items are that drop. In order to prevent too much item spam, in Path of Exile 2 we want to rely on Item Rarity more, and Item Quantity less. This means that the effect that Monster Item Rarity has on your item needs to be powerful, and noticeable. Currently we believe that this stat is not affecting drops enough. For example, when a Wisp has possessed a monster, it gives the monster +2 drops and 300% more Monster Item Rarity. The rarity is further increased by each monster that the wisp affected as you were chasing it. This should in theory result in noticeably better item drops, but in practice it doesn't feel meaningful enough. This is just one example, but this problem affects drops game wide, from all monsters and chests. We are making some very significant changes to the way that Item Rarity affects the items you get. Here are some of the highlights: We modified the rarity value at which Normal Items no longer drop. This means that Unique Bosses will never drop Normal items except for a select few early in the game. We have halved the amount of ""Rare Gold"" drops. This means that if you roll a Rare item you get more Rare Equipment or Rare currency instead of gold. Rare Gold piles are now twice as large so you still get the same amount of gold as before on average. Gold, Magic Currency, Quality Currency, Flasks, Charms, and Runes are now much less likely to drop from monsters with high Item Rarity. These three changes generally result in around 20-30% more Rare Currency (Exalt, Alch, Regal, etc). Tier 2 Rares now drop 4x more often. Tiers 3 to 5 now drop 30% more often. The mods of Tiered rares have also been improved by cutting out more low level mods making them better on average than before. Tier 2 and higher Magic items now drop around 5x more often. The low level mod culling of Tiered Magics has been significantly improved with Tier 2 now culling 50% of the mod range, and improving from there. Tier 5 magic items will usually only roll the highest mod available for a given type. This means that Tiered Magic items should be a much better starting point for crafting or Recombination. These changes significantly improve the effect that Item Rarity has on the quality of the items you receive. Overall you should see significantly better items when killing more challenging content. One side effect of this change would have been to make Player Item Rarity that you get on mods on your gear more valuable also, which is not our intention. In order to counter that, we have reduced the effect that these mods have. We have also lowered the Map Item Rarity mods on Maps as these were having too large of an effect after these changes. The overall effect of these mods will still be similar to before, but the displayed number is lower. Unique Boss Drop Protection Even if a monster has high Monster Item Rarity, sometimes you can still get a bad drop because you happened to get unlucky. Drop protection involves adding an additional item in the case where you didn't get lucky with the items that naturally dropped. We already have some drop protection rules in place to prevent some of the worst cases, but we didn't think that they went far enough. We have made the following change: Except for a few Unique Bosses at the start of Act 1, all Unique Bosses will always drop a Rare item. In the campaign, you only get the guaranteed Rare item the first time you kill the boss. In maps you always get it. Azmerian Wisps Azmerian Wisps were a great example of content that wasn't feeling rewarding enough because Item Rarity was not having enough of an effect. Wisps now feel much better from those changes alone, but we also made the following changes: Rare monsters possessed by Azmerian Wisps now always drop a Rare item. Fixed a bug where the first Wisp in the Grelwood didn't have its Item Rarity or Quantity stats. Rare and Magic Chests We didn't feel that Rare and Magic chests were exciting enough to find. Ideally each time you see one, you feel excited to open it. In order to fix this, we made the following changes: Magic chests have drastically increased Item Rarity and Quantity, and also guarantee at least a Magic item. They are approximately as rewarding as Rare chests were before. Rare chests also have drastically increased Item Rarity and Quantity, and guarantee at least a Rare item. In Cruel Difficulty chests get a further +50% more Item Quantity and Item Rarity, and +100% more in Endgame maki...",1746067889,
2694490,Upcoming Plans for 0.2.0g,"With Patch 0.2.0f deployed, we're already planning the next wave of improvements we want to be making. Our current plan is to try to get 0.2.0g ready as soon as we can. We are of course remaining flexible around this because of the Easter Holidays and ANZAC Day (A New Zealand public holiday) next week. The main focus of 0.2.0g will be to address two highly sought after improvements as well as a flurry of other minor to moderate changes. The first improvement is around Loot drops. The three main changes you can expect around this is to first mitigate unlucky streaks from bosses in the campaign by raising the floor of the quality of their drops. The second is to increase the quality of drops from bosses overall, and the third is to improve the drops from monsters possessed by Azmerian Wisps. The second improvement is around Corrupted Nexuses. They can be difficult and time consuming to find and often players progress in waystone tiers much faster than they can complete the Nexuses. We will be reducing the number of Nexuses needed to be completed to attain all your Atlas Passive Points and improving visibility of them into the Fog on the Atlas Map. On top of that we're also going to improve accessibility to Pinnacle content further by reducing the difficulty of Simulacrums and also by increasing the rewards and lowering outlying difficulty spikes from Remnants in Expeditions. These are just some of the changes we'll be working towards deploying over the next couple of weeks, we appreciate all of the feedback coming in and will keep an eye on it and keep addressing concerns as we can! Thanks very much and we wish you all a happy Easter weekend. ",1744882207,
2694490,Path of Exile 2 0.2.0f Patch Notes Preview,"We recently announced some improvements to Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt. Many of these improvements, including Ascendancy respeccing will be coming in patch 0.2.0f, which we're planning to release later today. The following patch notes are still subject to change prior to the patch’s deployment. This patch may take roughly 15 minutes to become available to download on PlayStation after it has been deployed. 0.2.0f Patch Notes This patch adds support for respeccing ascendancy classes, atlas bookmarks, new stash tab affinites, changes to charms and totems, as well as many other improvements and bug fixes. Respeccing Ascendancy Classes Redoing an Ascendancy Trial now allows you to respec which Ascendancy Class you have chosen at the Ascension device, but only if the Trial would grant you the number of points you already have. In order to respec your Ascendancy class, you must have zero points allocated in it, but you can now talk to Balbala or The Trialmaster to Refund Passive Points. Trials of Chaos that have 7 chambers and thus grant up to 4 Ascendancy Passive Skill Points now can be attempted from level 55, down from 60. Trials of Chaos that have 10 chambers and thus grant up to 6 Ascendancy Passive Skill Points can now be attempted from level 65, down from 75. Charm Changes Belts level 30 and above now have implicit modifiers with 1-2 Charm Slots, while Belts level 60 and above now have implicit modifiers with 1-3 Charm Slots. This only affects new Belts found after this patch has been deployed. The explicit modifiers for additional Charm Slots on Belts can no longer roll. The Zerphi's Genesis and Ingenuity Unique Belts no longer have additional Charm Slot Modifiers, though existing versions of these items are not affected. Bijouborne has intentionally kept its additional Charm Slots for now as in the future we will be expanding the maximum possible Charm slots to 6. Massively increased the values on the Prefixes that Restore Life, Mana or grant Guard when Charms are used. You can update existing items to the new values with a Divine Orb. All Charms but the Golden Charm have had their maximum Charges halved and their Charges per Use Halved, making them refill more quickly. The base duration of Stone Charm has also been increased from 2.5 seconds to 3 seconds. New Stash Tab Affinities Added Stash Tab Affinities for the following categories of items: Socketables Fragments (includes Tablets and Trial Keys) Breach Expedition Ritual Atlas Bookmarks Added the ability to bookmark locations on your atlas to find them easily later. Right clicking a node will allow you create a bookmark by picking an icon and optionally adding a label you can type in. You can have up to 16 bookmarks at a time. They will appear as icons around the outside of the screen with a direction allowing you to scroll to them easily, or you can click on them to instantly take you there. You can also view a list of bookmarks under the legend and click them to go there. Endgame Changes Pinnacle Bosses now have unlimited respawn attempts at Difficulty 0. Tower and Hideout Maps now have a higher minimum number of Rare monsters that can spawn. The final Rare monster defeated in Tower and Hideout Maps will now drop a Map of the same tier you are running (as long as you have enough Waystone Chance). Defeating the final Rare monster in Tower Maps is still not required to complete a Tower Map. Added UI tracking for Rare & Unique Monsters in Unique Maps, Tower Maps and Hideout Maps. Crafting Changes As each new Rune Tier is unlocked we are removing the lower runes from the drop pool. This is to stop you getting spammed with lesser runes at high levels. Lesser Runes no longer drop past level 31. (Medium) Runes no longer drop past level 52. Overall past level 52 you will now drop more Greater Runes than currently, but Lesser Runes and Runes will no longer drop. Rogue Exiles will always have appropriate Tier Runes socketed into dropped items relative to their item levels. Sceptres can now have sockets, and we've added a new set of Talisman modifiers for Sceptres to allow upgrades to your Minions at mid to late game. Totem Changes All Totem Skills now start gaining Elemental Resistances and Chaos Resistance, scaling up with Skill level, from around Gem level 13. At gem level 20 they have +75% to all Elemental Resistances and +35% to Chaos Resistances. Ironwood Support now also grants Totems summoned by supported skills +10% to all Maximum Elemental Resistance. Light Stun Changes Moderately reduced the capacity for monsters to Light Stun you especially towards Cruel and Endgame by lowering the amount of Stun-Damage they deal, and increasing the minimum they must deal to Light Stun you. Additionally, Elemental, Chaos and Ranged stun-damage has been penalised even further so you're less likely to get stunned by random stray projectiles and other things of the sort. These changes don't affect Light Stuns dealt by players. We've added a cluster to the Passi...",1744758314,

2694490,Further Changes From Today,"Yesterday we listed a bunch of changes that we are making to improve the game. 0.2.0e will be deployed tomorrow at around 3PM PDT, it will contain all the changes we have posted about from the last few days as well as some other things we have been working on today. This following list of the changes are just the changes that have been made so far, these are not the only changes we are investigating and they do not represent a full list of what players are reporting to us. Monster Speed Changes Many players have been reported being overwhelmed by monsters. The cause of this is a variety of factors and we are addressing them on a case by case basis. We have listed monster changes act by act below, but we also made the following changes more generally. Many human monsters including the Cultists in Freythorn, the Faridun and the Tribal Humans in Act Three have behaviour where they can interrupt their melee attacks if the player moves too far out of range during the attack, especially for attacks that have multiple hits like a swipe left into swipe right. These interrupt events have been primarily removed especially on things that were attacking very fast as it caused the monsters to be relentlessly able to pursue and attack you giving you no time to engage or use skills between their attacks. The Haste Aura monster modifier no longer appears on monsters that are already fast. Act 1 Werewolf Prowlers and Tendril Prowlers now will enter a walking stance (as opposed to running) after performing a melee action, they will only begin running again if you get a certain distance away from them. This behaviour has been applied to many faster monsters. Hungering Stalkers now have 12% less Life and Damage, they were already relatively weak but we have lowered it a bit further to account for their high movement speed and attack speed. They are intended to engage and attack quickly, but be weak and die fast. Reduced the number of Bloom Serpents in The Red Vale. Halved the number of Venomous Crabs in the Hunting Grounds. The Cultists in Freythorn no longer have interrupt events on their attacks as described above. The Cultists in Freythorn wielding Axes and Maces in Freythorn now walk after performing a Melee Action, only running again once you exit a certain distance. Blood Cretins on death Blood Pools have had their duration decreased from 6 seconds to 4 seconds, and fixed the area of effect to match the visual more closely. Reduced the overall density of more challenging monsters in Ogham Manor. Act 2 The Boulder Ants in Titan Valley have been replaced by Risen Maraketh, as the area had too many monsters that had irritating movement. The Faridun have all been modified to remove the interrupt events on their attacks as described above.. Act 3 Diretusk Boar and Antlion Charger's are now more likely to push you to the side instead of pushing you along with them when they charge you. The Lost City monster pack composition has been adjusted to result in less ranged monsters Massively adjusted the Azak Bog, firstly by the aforementioned changes to interrupt events, but also changed the monster composition of the area to have less Ranged and Elite monsters. Fixed an issue where the Slitherspitter's poison spray in Venom Crypts was dealing Chaos Damage instead of Physical Damage unintentionally. We have also identified another issue that affects some areas in which potential monster spawn locations have inconsistent density in different rooms. This leads to situations where some rooms are much denser with monsters than others in an unintended way. We have a fix for this problem but it did not make it into this patch, and will be deployed in a later patch. These are not the only changes that we will be making to monsters. Further changes will come in later updates. Some changes we didn't get time to make today, and others require new animations that will take a little longer. Boss Changes Viper Napuatzi is one of the more challenging bosses for players, so we made the following change. Lowered the amount and size of Chaos Rains (the purple ones) in the Viper Napuatzi fight, and cleaned up the visual left afterwards faster to make the following drop locations more obvious. Uxmal had various quirks that made him somewhat annoying to fight. We have made a few changes. Reduced the number of times Uxmal changes locations through the fight Uxmal can no longer recharge Energy Shield while in the air. Uxmal uses his Flame Breath less often Xyclucian had some issues with visibility of his effects The arena of Xyclucian has had its ground foliage removed in order to make his effects more visible Player Minion Changes We have changed the way that minion revive timers work. When your first minion dies, it sets the revive timer to 7.5 seconds as before, but each successive minion that dies increases it by less and less (still capped to a max of 7.5 seconds). This should heavily mitigate the situation where most of your minions are dead, but t...",1744262274,

2694490,Path of Exile 2 - Upcoming Changes,"Today we are continuing to work on changes based on player feedback and this is a list of the updates that we have finished internally. We will be deploying the following changes over the next few days. This is just a list of the changes that have been made so far. These are not the only changes we are investigating and they do not represent a full list of what players are reporting to us. Player Balance Changes Now that we have a lot of the nerfs out of the way, we can concentrate on buffing things that are not performing well. Sorceress Specific Changes Arc now does a lightning explosion when it hits a shocked enemy but can no longer shock. It does not consume the shock. Eye of Winter now gains bonus elemental damage when passing through other elemental orbs like Solar Orb, Orb of Storms or Frost Bomb. Incinerate's exposure duration has been increased to 8 seconds from 2 seconds. Mana Tempest can now be used with all spells, and has been changed to cause empowered spells to split to additional targets instead of chaining or forking. Frostbolt explosion radius has been increased by 50%. Ice Nova's freeze buildup has been increased significantly. Frost Bomb exposure duration has been increased to 8 seconds from 5 seconds. Mana remnants has been changed to work with other elemental ailments than just shock. We are lowering the delay for Ignites spreading from sources such as the Wildfire support to 1 second from 2 seconds, but the radius has been decreased slightly. Chaos Innoculation Chaos Innoculation now prevents bleeding. The passive clusters that grant you additional stun threshold based on your maximum energy shield now also increase your ailment threshold so you will no longer be ignited/chilled/frozen/shocked as often while using CI if you take these passives. Huntress Specific Changes Parried enemies can no longer evade your attacks. Energy Shield no longer prevents bleeding from being applied. The spear stuck in enemies by Rapid Assault now always bleeds on hit when you detonate it, the AoE has been increased by 20% and the detonate does 67% more damage. Spearfield's spear duration has been increased to 10 seconds from 6 and had it's damage growth increased, dealing 30% more damage by level 20. Herald of Blood no longer deletes the corpses of Rares or Uniques, allowing you to use Ritual Sacrifice on the rares. Warrior Specific Changes Temper Weapon on Smith of Kitava now adds 3 empowerments per strike of your weapon, and is 25% faster. The damage might need to come down a little. Shield Wall is now detonatable with Warcries. Armour break being applied to players by monsters no longer has the 20% extra physical damage modifier that was intended to only be a buff to players, and we have also reduced its duration to 4 seconds from 12. In addition, there was a bug where partial armour breaks were never removed on the player. Ranger Specific Changes Stormcaller arrow now proliferates shocks to nearby enemies in a small radius and has had its AoE radius increased by 50%. Lightning Rod damage has been increased by 30%, and their duration has been increased to 20 seconds. Lightning Arrow has had the radius at which it arcs to targets increased by 50%. Tornado Shots maximum duration has been increased to 15 seconds New Support Gem We have added a support gem called Inhibitor that prevents charges being consumed but increases the damage of the supported skill by 4% for each type of charge you have. Delirium Changes Delirium encounters now last approximately 2.5x longer. Crafting We've added several Artificers Orb's to fixed locations throughout the campaign allowing you to craft with them more often. We have also added runes for attributes allowing you to fix early game requirement issues. We are also updating all runes to also apply to Wands and Staves. This work will require adding specific mods for these items. We are unsure if Soul Cores and Talismans will be able to be added at the same time, but it is our intention to attempt to make this change. Finding Rares in Endgame During endgame a common issue is missing a Rare in the corner of the map that you didn't happen to explore. In order to mitigate this issue, we have changed rares to show up on the minimap at all times. Matlan Waterways We have made a change to Matlan Waterways to merge some sections of water together, reducing the average number of levers that you will encounter while playing it by 6 levers. Monster Speed One of the issues that is often reported is getting swarmed by monsters. We are currently doing a pass to investigate this issue and can probably talk about specific changes tomorrow, but the changes are likely to be targeted at specific monsters that are too difficult, especially in zones that have a lot of fast monsters. A Note About The Ritual Exploit Recently there was an exploit involving reducing the deferral cost of Ritual items in combination with using a Unique Tablet that allows for unlimited rerolls. This occurred during t...",1744173475,

2694490,Changes to Act 3 Areas in Path of Exile 2,"In our update post yesterday we said we would be checking to see if there were any outliers in the area clear times during the campaign. Now that we have done the first pass of our assessment, we can talk about some of the changes that we are making to improve things. Our focus this time is on Act 3 areas since this act has a somewhat overall longer completion time. The Drowned City This area had a very large dead end that was intended to contain an entrance to an area that was temporarily cut to ship Early Access. Unfortunately this means that in the live version, this leads up to an inaccessible door with no checkpoint. We are removing that part of the level and the part that leads up to it which will reduce the overall size of the area quite a lot, but more importantly prevent the frustrating situation where you go the wrong way and have to backtrack. Utzaal This area has exactly the same problem as the Drowned City and we are doing exactly the same fix, but in addition has a second dead end where the entrance to the Treasure Vault is located in the Present version of this area. We have removed that dead end as well. The Apex Of Filth This area is shaped like a large spiral which was originally done because the boss arena had to be in the center to maintain continuity with the Past version. We are breaking that continuity to make the area smaller, which will make the area better overall. The Azak Bog This area is a large square that has extremely high variance in how long it takes to find the boss because the location of that boss is highly variable. We have changed this area to be more rectangular with the boss at the other end from where you start which means that you can get to the boss more quickly without needing to explore the entire area as well as making it somewhat smaller. Infested Barrens This area primarily trips people up because it requires you to find a waypoint to the Waterways before you can continue on to the Chimeral Wetlands if you want to be able to come back easily after finishing Jiquani's Sanctum. We are modifying the area to have a bottleneck requiring you to go past the entrance to the Waterways near the start meaning that there are less things you need to try to find in this area and cutting down the size slightly. Jungle Ruins This area had a problem where it was often hard to identify the exit to the Infested Barrens from far enough away. We have made the entrance more clear and moved the checkpoint further so that you are more likely to see it. This area has also been made slightly smaller. Chimeral Wetlands This area has some random variations that put the entrance to the Temple of the Chaos very far away from the entrance to the Machinarium requiring a lot of backtracking. We are moving these two entrances closer together. Jiquani's Machinarium This area primarily takes extra time due to searching for Soul Cores. We have added an extra Soul Core to reduce the average amount of time it takes to find them. Jiquani's Sanctum This area suffers from the same problem as Machinarium. We have added an extra Soul Core to this area as well to reduce the amount of time you need to search. General Changes We have also noticed that a common issue is doing a side area and then coming back to the main area and finding that it has been reset, making you need to clear it a second time. We have a more permanent solution in mind for this, issue but as a temporary improvement we have increased the timeout time for areas with side-areas off them. This should reduce how often you run into this issue. These changes should be deployed within the next few days. Of course, we will continue to monitor things and see if further changes are needed.

2694490,Dawn of the Hunt - What We’re Working On,"Many people are reporting that gameplay is feeling too slow. Sometimes this comes in the form of people saying that monster life is too high, or player damage is too low, or areas are taking too long. In this post we will talk about some of the things we have already done, and more of the changes we are planning on making. Huntress Specific Concerns One of the major concerns that we have seen for the Huntress is that a lot of the power of the class is locked behind the Parry mechanic, and some players do not wish to Parry. Getting Frenzy charges without Parry is an option available to the class later on, but there are no other early game options that don't involve Parrying. We want to give early game players an option to get Frenzy charges without Parry, but we have to be very careful not to make this too easy and remove the rewards for doing the Parry combos. In order to do this, we are adding a new Skill on the second row of the Spear skills called Cull the Weak. This skill is effectively the same as Killing Palm on the Monk, but for Frenzy charges. If a monster is in Culling Range, using Cull the Weak will charge towards the monster, kill it instantly, and give you a Frenzy charge. This skill should be patched in over the next few days. We also want to improve the feeling of Parry more generally. Two issues we have identified are that in some cases it feels like you should Parry monsters but don't, and that in other cases you get Heavy Stunned in cases where you feel like you shouldn't. We are currently investigating improvements to these. The other bit of feedback are players who don't want to enter melee range at all. While the primary role of the class is incentivising a ranged/melee hybrid playstyle, we do think we can improve on this type of gameplay somewhat while still incentivising using both types of attacks. To make this type of gameplay feel better we are going to be buffing the speed of Spear throws generally, but especially Lightning Spear. The damage will remain the same, meaning that you will get approximately a 25% buff to DPS from using only Lightning Spear. Some other spear throws will receive slight speed increases too, but they generally have other mechanics that mean that attack speed on them is less relevant. Player Minion Damage and Life One of the areas of major balance adjustment in 0.2.0 was the minion life and damage curves for players. In the 0.1.1 endgame, minion characters were getting very out of control values mostly due to being able to significantly increase gem level on these gems. We previously significantly reduced the growth of minion life and damage as these gems gain levels, and the intention was to mostly hit the top of the endgame, but it seems that this had an unintended effect on campaign play as well. We are making a change to increase the damage and life that minions get during the campaign to be more similar to before, while still keeping the scaling nerfs that were introduced to the higher minion gem levels for the endgame. Monster Life Too High One of the first things we looked at when considering clearspeed concerns was the monster life curve. We found that monster life through most of the campaign after Act 1 was probably too high. We have made an adjustment to lower monster life by 25% through most of the campaign and this change has been deployed already. A second issue we found was that the life bonus on Rare Minions was incredibly high. One of the reasons why this feels particularly bad is because these monsters are still White, but had more life than Blue monsters. This calibrates players' expectations incorrectly and makes Rare fights harder than they should be. This number has been set back to what it was in 0.1.0 which lowers rare minion life by about 60%. This change has also been deployed. Large Area Sizes Many players are reporting that areas feel like they are too large. Normally when this is the case, the main reason is due to other concerns such as monster life or player damage being incorrect, or just a lack of entertaining content in the area. However, we are checking to see if there are any outliers that players are spending too long in to see if any changes to area size need to happen. In the meantime, we did notice that there are some areas that don't have sufficient checkpoints, so we are doing a pass of adding some more of these. Crashes and Disconnects On launch day we had a severe and common client crash in town. The ""Failed to deserialise object"" crash. This crash was fixed on the first day, but there are still other client and server crashes that remain. Currently the number of client crashes is actually a bit lower than in 0.1.1 due to working around the somewhat common nVidia driver crash, but the rate of server side crashes is approximately 6 times higher, which results in you getting suddenly disconnected. Thankfully, server side crashes are significantly easier for us to debug, and we believe that we should be able to resolv...",1743994064,
