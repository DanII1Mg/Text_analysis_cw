1063730,Daggers Release Notes,"Cut through Corruption with the new Daggers weapon, featuring S tier Dexterity scaling and E Tier Strength scaling.

Perk Charms are also available through Reekwater and Cutlass shops.The mastery trees for Daggers are Blades and Stealth.

1063730,Season 10: Nighthaven - Release Notes,"New World: Aeternum - Season 10: Nighthaven downtime will begin at 5:00 a.m. PT (12:00 p.m. UTC) on October 13 and last approximately 2 hours. Explore a realm hidden from Aeternum for generations.Uncover the fate of the Tear of Gaea, navigate treacherous alliances, and face threats born from darkness itself. Between a mysterious new zone, evolving endgame systems, and a 10-player raid, this season reshapes how you journey and endure. The Nighthaven update will release on Monday, October 13 and will be free for all New World: Aeternum owners.​New Zone: NighthavenAn ancient land rich with history, Nighthaven was largely cut off from the rest of Aeternum for lifetimes under the direction of its powerful king. Those few who did visit the haunting woods and mighty castles tell stories of mysterious figures, tall and lithe, engaged both in the politics of the court and in the dark hallways of the land’s many ruins. These inhabitants can be both charming and welcoming, or vicious and fearsome, depending on how they view those that they interact with. They rule at the behest of their king, carving out pieces of the land that they oversee on his behalf.There are also stories of monstrous creatures that seem to exhibit the qualities of both man and beast. Although they have largely been known to stalk the dark forests and hills of Nighthaven, they have recently become bolder, becoming a more ever-present threat.Nighthaven is a land shrouded in mystery, where the dark holds sway over the light. Power lies deep in the catacombs and ruins of this land for those who are bold and brave enough to venture there. Discover the secrets hidden in the shadows of these ancient halls, and use them to confront the threats endangering not only the people of Nighthaven, but the whole of Aeternum as well.To get the most out of Nighthaven, you’ll need to do a little more exploration than in previous zones. Your journey will take you through uncharted underworld catacombs and complex castles and vertical structures. The quest tracker won’t always tell you exactly where to go or what to do, and the best rewards will only come to those who explore.New Story: The Tear of GaeaAfter the events of Elysian Wilds, Morgaine left with the Tear of Gaea to sequester it somewhere safe, away from ambitious intent. However, it seems that her journey was met with ill fortune, and the Tear has gone missing. She is once more turning to the Soulwarden in an attempt to recover the Tear and keep the world safe from whatever nefarious intent may be planned for it!Travel within the newly discovered land of Nighthaven, and engage the enigmatic and mysterious figures that call it home as you search for the divine artifact. Search through ageless ruins and the facades of opulence as you work to uncover the truth of what is happening in this isolated and reclusive land. But be wary, as trust is a commodity in short supply throughout Nighthaven.New Game Mode: CatacombsCatacombs is a new game mode in which up to three players explore the depths of a procedurally generated dungeon, battling a wide variety of enemies and bosses, gaining unique mode-specific powerups, collecting cursed resources and currency, and racing to successfully exit and cleanse their treasures before time runs out.While the difficulty of Catacombs is moderate at the start of a session, the challenge (and reward) is increased significantly each time a boss is defeated. To counter this, players are able to acquire in-mode power-ups that enhance their stats and abilities. With each boss defeated, players must decide between pushing further into the Catacombs for even greater rewards or safely making their exit before time run out. Failure to make a safe exit results in loss of the vast majority of the treasures collected, but only one player needs to safely exit to avoid this.The procedurally generated nature of the mode makes every run different. Each session presents the players with a uniquely generated Catacomb constructed from a tile based algorithm. The layout of the Catacomb is revealed room by room as players explore. Enemies, encounters, bosses, and hazards are different in every run. Each time you delve into the Catacombs, you’ll need to explore and chart the map, and decide how to spend your limited time. Will you press forward, or backtrack to get more powerups before advancing? And will you have enough time to extract with your spoils?In a successful Catacombs run you’ll earn two new currencies, Sterlings and Crowns. Sterlings are earned all over the dungeon, but Crowns only come from bosses (only the second one and beyond). To trade these currencies for Catacombs-specific rewards, you’ll need to bring them to the Catacombs Delver near the Inn in Nighthaven’s settlement, Tularest Abbey.You can access Catacombs from the Activity Finder.​New Raid: Isle of NightIsle of Night is a new 10-person end game raid.

1063730,The Chronicle of Nighthaven,"Nighthaven, long since whispered to exist, reveals itself like a full moon beyond a pale night cloud. I’ll tell you the tale of Nighthaven, as my Baba once told me every night before I lay my head to sleep.The land is ruled by its domineering King with an ill-tempered fist. The populace and peasantry serve the Crown, gutted by both the unfair taxation and the horrors of the dimly lit woods which engulf it. Nighthaven’s currency is not just gold and wheat by the barrel, but nightmares and dreams and memories that fade to wisps. Charms, totems, and talismans guard the doorframes of every villager, patient for the relieving chime of a bell’s new day. For there are secrets, darker than the imagination, that lurk behind the corner of your eye.The traveling troupe of the Grand Carnival leads a rebellion, stashed away in the deep recesses of the territory. Hidden from the aggressions of the ruling House and its lower court: House Varlaam, House Bathory, House Carmilla. These few oligarchs who command the rabble are just as vicious in their rage as they are in their gluttonous everyday excess. Servants of the castle-rich speak in hushed tones beyond cold steel gates and dark dungeons, willing to look past the atrocities committed in the dead of night for a few more coins, or a few more days of sanity, whichever is most needed at the time.The capital of the realm, the King’s own castle, expands on the horizon as if a great wailing behemoth. Impossibly immense—a man-made mountain that grips the mind in its lavishness and enormity. A castle keep that swallows the horizon like the whale swallowed Jonah, but without the promise of God’s return or saving. Once the Castle has claimed you in its bowels, you are nothing more than another fixture, another book of memories lodged on a dusty shelf to never be remembered again. The King’s Castle is a fortress that is said to be as wide as it is tall, and burrows just as deep as its towers graze the moon.And standing in it all, the great reminder: the Clocktower, a looming and ever-present monument to the truest of secrets, that eternity is not forever. Death comes for us all. Even in Aeternum.Baba said there once was the promise of a nation now steeped in misery, and none can look further than the abandoned villages, farmyards, and animal pens of the smallfolk in the Manorlands. Their daily toil and the sweat of their brow feed this nation—yet the pigs, chickens, and cows are not the true livestock.Deep in the Hinterland, a bounty amasses of perfect pumpkins and golden apple orchards. Left untended, these wild sprouts give way to wild things. The forests run red with persistent fall colors to the north, to Highmarch, and these perfectly splendid colors soon fade along the borders of cursed woods and tumbling sorrowthorn briars, thick enough to strangle the reindeer that still call this land their home. Wild and dangerous, the cursed woods are home to apocryphal beasts that walk on two legs like man, but are urged by a mammalian instinct of true predation.Nighthaven is full of secrets, Baba says. So many secrets hidden beneath the surface like flesh-eating ticks hiding underneath your skin. For all its liminal shades, the crust of Nighthaven and the overworld are but fleeting, like ghostly dancers still stepping to music unheard.But Baba said, Nighthaven is a carcass. And the worms and maggots below are the real Nighthaven. Endless miles of catacombs, caverns, caves, and crevasses are the permanent home of so many fresh and unsightly horrors. To step into the Underworld below Nighthaven is stepping into your own doom. If the risen dead, or the madness of ghosts, cannot claim you, then the eight-legged children of Uttu certainly shall.But what saving grace is there to run from these terrors? These soul-wracking phobias? Baba says there is hope, if you cling to the Towers that dot the land. Rising above the darkness, as if built as a means to escape the thickness of dread below, you’ll spot dozens of safe places above the treeline. Like the jagged teeth of a rabid beast, the Towers of Nighthaven promise sanctuary if you can decipher their runed, magicked stones. These places are infused with the magic of the old ways, but they can betray you if you do not master your own mind and memory. Shadows of the past will rob you of your senses if you cannot withstand the torment of your own mind.Baba also says there was once a group of people who tried, and failed, to cut and burn back the horrors of Nighthaven. Their shrill cries and religious texts and fervent dedication to their church were their sword, their shield, and their sanity. But after marinating in so much hatred and rage, they lost the latter, and became just as mindless and corrupt as the terrible things they swore would be eradicated. And now their story is just another red brushstroke on the canvas of Nighthaven, their angels fallen and their priests inflamed with an unconscious need to destroy.Like all things, Baba says, ...",1759513423,

1063730,Outpost Rush Map Preview: Tower of Calomel,"Start: Sep 23, 2025End: Sep 30, 2025High above the mists of Aeternum, a looming monument of stone, steel, and sorcery rises. Known as The Tower of Calomel, this gothic fortress fuses ancient magic with engineering brilliance. Once a seat of power and sanctuary, it now stands as a battlefield where 20 warriors on each side clash for dominance.A Fortress of Height and DepthThe Tower of Calomel delivers a three-layered battlefield that rewards mastery of vertical combat. From sweeping outer battlements to the shadowed depths of the undercroft, each level demands unique tactics. Elevated positions provide commanding views but leave defenders vulnerable, while the lower passages conceal twisting mines, corrupted arenas, and deadly surprises. The Flow of BattleCombat surges across interconnected spaces, each offering distinct challenges:Outer Battlements – Long sightlines give ranged fighters dominance, but exposed walls leave them open to coordinated pushes and flanking fire.The Inner Bailey – The heart of the battlefield, where elevation shifts and choke points turn every mid-range clash into a brawl for control.The Undercroft – A labyrinth of tunnels hiding twin mines, resource nodes, a corrupted portal, and the fearsome Baroness—a high-risk, high-reward objective.At the center rises the Central Keep, a towering capture point that anchors the fight, while fortified gatehouses on either flank test the coordination of attackers and defenders alike.Risk, Reward, and ResourcesStrategic movement defines The Tower of Calomel. Resource nodes and mines fuel upgrades and summon opportunities, drawing players into constant conflict. Securing the undercroft’s twin mines can tip the balance, while timing a successful Baroness takedown or activating the corrupted portal can deliver game-changing advantages. Every decision matters: whether to hold the heights, harvest from below, or commit to a risky push into enemy defenses.Balance ConsiderationsWhile height provides powerful oversight, no position is impregnable. Exposed battlements make defenders vulnerable to coordinated assaults, and multiple approach routes keep combat fluid. Resources are distributed to encourage movement between levels, ensuring the battle never stalls.Strategic DepthVictory belongs to those who balance control of the high ground with presence in the resource-rich depths. Coordinated assaults across multiple levels, timed boss engagements, and clever use of underground flanking routes create endless possibilities for dynamic play.The Tower of Calomel brings verticality, corruption, and relentless conflict to Outpost Rush. Whether commanding from the battlements or carving through the shadowed tunnels, only those who master both the heights and the depths will claim victory.",1758560786,

They rule at the behest of their king, carving out pieces of the land that they oversee on his behalf.There are also stories of monstrous creatures that seem to exhibit the qualities of both man and beast. Although they have largely been known to stalk the dark forests and hills of Nighthaven, they haven recently become bolder, becoming a more ever-present threat.Nighthaven is a land shrouded in mystery, where the dark holds sway over the light. Power lies deep in the catacombs and ruins of this land to those who are bold and brave enough to venture there. Discover the secrets hidden in the shadows of these ancient halls, and use them to confront the threats endangering not only the people of Nighthaven, but the whole of Aeternum as well.New Story: The Tear of GaeaAfter the events of Elysian Wilds, Morgaine left with the Tear of Gaea to sequester it somewhere safe, away from ambitious intent. However, it seems that her journey was met with ill fortune, and the Tear has gone missing. She is once more turning to the Soulwarden in an attempt to recover the Tear and keep the world safe from whatever nefarious intent may be planned for it.Travel within the newly discovered land of Nighthaven, and engage the enigmatic and mysterious figures that call it home as you search for the divine artifact. Search through ageless ruins and the facades of opulence as you work to uncover the truth of what is happening in this isolated and reclusive land. But be wary, as trust is a commodity in short supply throughout Nighthaven.New Game Mode: CatacombsCatacombs is a new game mode in which up to three players explore the depths of a procedurally generated dungeon, battling a wide variety of enemies and bosses, gaining unique mode-specific powerups, collecting cursed resources and currency, and racing to successfully exit and cleanse their treasures before time runs out.While the difficulty of Catacombs is moderate at the start of a session, the challenge (and reward) is increased significantly each time a boss is defeated. To counter this, players are able to acquire in-mode power-ups that enhance their stats and abilities. With each boss defeated, players must decide between pushing further into the Catacombs for even greater rewards or safely making their exit before time run out. Failure to make a safe exit results in loss of the vast majority of the treasures collected, but only one player needs to safely exit to avoid this.New Raid: Isle of NightIsle of Night is a new 10-person endgame raid. The raid is set in a once magnificent kingdom whose inhabitants have now fallen Lost. Similar in length and format to Hive of Gorgons, this raid features three new bosses and multiple new enemy types, light puzzles, and set piece encounters. This raid will be some of the hardest content in the Season 10, demanding players gear-up and coordinate to succeed.Overhauled Endgame ProgressionNighthaven brings with it numerous game-wide changes to systems, progression, gearing, and rewards. Our goal with these changes is to form a connective tissue that motivates a variety of play in endgame activities, and enables players to customize their loadouts in ways they never could before to discover unique and powerful combinations of equipment.Level Cap to 70, Gear Score Max To 800Along with a level cap increase, gear score is raising from 725 to 800. PvP Modes which currently scale gear to 700, will now scale to 775.New Gear Modding System - “Perk Charms”Instead of 1 customizable gem socket, gear can now have up to four empty sockets into which players can install new perk modifiers called ""charms."" Charm sockets and charms themselves have three types: Defensive, Offensive, and Skill. These charms can be picked up fully refined, but more commonly will need to be crafted with rare materials which drop from endgame content.Set BonusesWe are introducing set bonuses into New World: Aeternum for the first time. These ultra rare sets of gear will be earned from pinnacle endgame content: Isle of Night Raid, Catacombs, and the P...",1758045937,

The decision to merge worlds is made with consideration for many areas affected by player population such as queue times, and availability of opportunities to take part in multiplayer content. Our goal is to provide the best experience for players possible, and we understand concerns around latency and how important performance is to players. We thank you for all of your feedback, and for the enthusiasm from the New World: Aeternum communities in the AP Southeast and SA East regions.Cross-Play EvolvesPlatform-exclusive Xbox worlds will be merged into regional cross-play environments. This will allow console players to enjoy all the challenges of Aeternum alongside a larger player base, creating more opportunities for adventures, alliances, and epic conflict.One PlayStation-exclusive world will remain in the US East region for those who prefer platform-specific play. All other PlayStation worlds will be merged into that world, giving players the freedom to choose their path — whether it’s sticking with familiar territory or stepping into the broader cross-play world.The Worlds in MotionHere are the specific merges taking place:To El Dorado (US West):Aquarius & Pleiades (US West)To Delos (AP Southeast)Cerberus & Crux (AP Southeast)To Devaloka (SA East)Alkaid & Chertan (SA East)To Aries (EU):Iroko (EU)To Pangea (US East):Sundew (US East)To Tumtum - Playstation Only (US East):Nihal (SA East)Taiyi (AP Southeast)Mardi (EU)Kronomo (US West)Important Dates to RememberTo ensure a smooth transition, please note the following:Tuesday, July 22Brief server restart for retiring worldsCharacter creation and transfers will be disabled on those worldsSunday, July 27All Wars on retiring worlds will be canceled and refundedWednesday, July 30Access to retiring worlds will be disabledCharacters and companies will be relocated to new home worldsTerritories on retiring worlds will be refunded to owning companiesReimbursement begins for transfer tokens used in the last 14 daysJust a heads-up: inactive players from affected regions will be placed into either a crossplay world (for Xbox) or the dedicated PlayStation world on US East, depending on their platform.We’ll continue to monitor world populations and performance closely after the merge, and we’re committed to staying adaptive as Aeternum continues to grow and evolve.A New Dawn AwaitsThese world merges are about more than consolidation — they’re about crafting the best version of New World: Aeternum for every adventurer.

Reminder: These rewards are only available during the event window—July 4 to July 7. Make sure your accounts are linked, your watch time is tracked, and your inventory is ready!The Castle map is a large, symmetrical arena built with high-risk objectives, vertical movement, and tactical creativity in mind.We sat down with the development team to break down the map’s design, the unique gameplay mechanics it supports, and how player feedback has shaped its evolution since the Preview Weekend.Castle Map DesignThe Castle map was designed to offer a more expansive play space while still supporting the fast-paced, objective-based gameplay central to Capture the Flag.Layout and Key FeaturesCentral High-Risk Path: A short, direct route runs through the middle of the map, providing the fastest path to the enemy flag—but also the most dangerous.Elevated Side Lanes: Each side of the map includes raised platforms, obstacles, and multiple paths. These areas feature jump pads for creative movement and quick escapes.Symmetry with Visual Distinction: While the map is symmetrical for competitive balance, one side has been visually marked with corruption effects to help players keep track of orientation during matches.“We were inspired by the Dynasty art style of Ebonscale Reach,” the team shared. “We added corrupted elements to one side of the map to create clear visual differentiation and help with in-match navigation.”The open midsection creates opportunities for long-range combat, while the sides offer cover and flanking routes—giving all weapon types room to shine.Gameplay Mechanics and Design IterationPower-Up Placement and UseJump pads aren’t just for mobility—they play a strategic role in flag runs. Power-ups are placed along the perimeter of the map, encouraging players to take alternative routes that reward clever movement and timing. Following the feedback during the first Preview Weekend, several power-ups were adjusted for clarity and effectiveness:Damage Power up: Empower duration increased to 30 secondsHeal Power up: Healing now provides a flat 10,000 healthSpeed Power up: Haste duration increased to 7 secondsChallenges and SolutionsDesigning a symmetrical map presented some early hurdles. Players often found it hard to identify which side they were on, especially in the heat of battle. Adding corrupted visuals to one side significantly improved orientation. Similarly, early testing revealed it was difficult to track flag carriers due to the map’s scale. Adding a visible beam on flag carriers solved that issue and helped focus team objectives.Live Tuning Tools and Season 9 InnovationsThe team has implemented flexible live-tuning tools that allow them to adjust key settings on the fly. These include:Flag respawn and lockout durationsPlayer respawn delaysPower-up spawn timersScoring rules and win conditionsThese tools will allow for responsive tuning during Season 9 and beyond.What’s Next for Capture the FlagThe team is already testing additional variants and rule sets for future updates:Neutral Flag Variant: In addition to the enemy flags, a neutral flag spawns in the center of the map, with both teams racing to capture and score.First-to-Three Scoring: Alternate pacing and match lengths to suit different playstyles and competitive formats. Advanced Rulesets: Competitive-focused formats such as sudden death or a one-flag mode are possible future variants.With new mechanics, improved balance, and live-tuning flexibility, Season 9 lays the groundwork for deeper competitive play and evolving variants in the months ahead. Whether you’re coordinating a team push, pulling off a last-second escape, or fine-tuning your loadout for the perfect flag run, this new mode brings fresh opportunities for strategy and skill.Stay sharp, and we’ll see you on the battlefield.",1751479556,

1063730,Faction Fest Event,"Rep your Faction, vie for dominance in Expeditions, and influence the future of Aeternum. How far will you go for your Faction? Faction Fest is a celebration of all things Factions. From June 27 through June 29, the Marauders, Syndicate, and Covenant will compete to finish the most daily objectives for event-specific rewards. Due to the PvE nature of Expeditions, this is mainly a cooperative event. All players will receive rewards regardless of their allegiance. The winning Faction will also influence the event narrative. Support your favorite to immortalize the next chapter of their story. How It WorksThere’s no need to sign up for Faction Fest. Simply join a Faction and complete Expeditions. Your progress will automatically count toward the event. Each day will feature a new daily objective tied to Expeditions. These objectives will be revealed starting on June 27 via the Faction Fest event page.Every time you complete an objective, your Faction’s score will increase. Objectives can be completed multiple times for additional points.After each day, all participants will earn Titles, such as Explorer and Scout. That day’s winning Faction will also be announced.

That means all players in the same Expedition party, regardless of Faction, will contribute to the daily objective. However, each Faction will have their own individual progress. More details — including the complete FAQ, Faction score updates, and daily objectives — are available now on the official event pageFaction MissionsHere are the motives and relationships behind each Faction’s involvement. Play your part to help determine what happens next. The Covenant: On a Journey for Divine Truth The Covenant see Aeternum differently than most, believing it to be the home of gods – a place anyone should feel privileged to walk upon. Through their investigations, members of the Covenant seek to learn more about the divine nature of the island and what the place of mortals might be there. They preach that coming to Aeternum is no accident, and that underneath the strange nature of the island lies a grand design, a plan that each farmer, merchant, and adventurer all have a part to play in. In order to inspire faith in their members and the people of the island, the Covenant comb the depths of Aeternum in search of truth. Some of the most dangerous places in Aeternum – known as the Expeditions – may harbor secrets that the Covenant can use to further their search for revelation. By tapping the skills of their bravest adventurers, the Covenant can gain access to these hidden truths by interpreting the writings, the artifacts, and overcoming the challenges within. To the Covenant, members of the Syndicate represent an active impediment to their quest for higher understanding, as their interpretations of Aeternum’s many relics and writings represent something akin to heresy. And the Marauders, who profess to be looking out for others, have no regard for the damage they do when parading through ancient, sacred halls. In the hearts of the Covenant, only they have the will and temperament to uncover and deliver the messages hidden in the ancient ruins of Aeternum. The Marauders: Freedom for All Aeternum is a place of wonders, a place where fantasy and reality meet, and a place of riches untold. It is also home to dangers unlike any that humans have ever seen, as if all the world’s myths sprang to life at once. While many of Aeternum’s people are just trying to etch out a living on the island, others take up arms and harness the power of the island to achieve their goals. The Marauders took that philosophy and made and ethos from it – using their own strength and prowess to create a better world for all. To them, the strong must stand to protect the weak, and ensure that every person has a chance for freedom on the island. To the Marauders, there is no place on Aeternum to better test their resolve than in the Expeditions, where the most savage of Aeternum’s dangers lurk. There they can prove their strength and martial might, and rally others to their cause – a world ruled by the strongest ...",1750695377,

1063730,Arena Deep Dive: New 3v3 Map Preview,"Get ready to test your skill, coordination, and adaptability in the newest 3v3 Arena battleground coming to New World: Aeternum. This all-new map — the largest Arena yet — is entering the fight with a limited-time Preview Weekend from June 17 through June 23, ahead of its full integration in Season 9. Here’s everything you need to know before stepping into the ring.A New Kind of ArenaWhile the name of the map will ultimately be voted on by the community, the location itself is already steeped in mystery. Deep within Aeternum, Syndicate explorers have uncovered an ancient site, its purpose long forgotten and its builders unknown. Though its weathered stonework suggests ties to early civilizations, the effigies and motifs hint at something far more primal — a place where animals or spirits were once worshiped, or perhaps feared.That power hasn’t faded. It lingers — drawing adventurers who seek to understand it, and fighters who would claim it through combat.This new map isn’t just visually distinct. It was designed in response to player feedback, offering a larger battlefield that creates meaningful strategic shifts between long-range and close-quarters combat. It’s not just a new arena — it’s a new way to play.Map OverviewLargest 3v3 Map Yet: Nearly 50% larger than existing Arena maps, with more elevation, cover, and flanking paths.Dynamic Combat Phases: The map favors ranged combat early on, but forcing players into melee engagements quickly.Environmental Landmarks: Ancient statues, waterfalls, and weathered ruins provide natural callouts and add to the tactical depth.“We wanted this to feel like a discovered place, not a constructed one. Something ancient, powerful, and reactive—visually and mechanically.” — Map Design TeamStrategic ImpactThe map’s scale and design create a distinct flow that pushes players to adapt:Team Composition: Ranged builds shine early, but melee dominance becomes critical once the circle tightens.Mobility & Flexibility: Static strategies won’t cut it. Positioning, cover usage, and role switching are key to staying alive.Cover Density: Sightlines are long at first but rapidly break down into close-range skirmishes, creating high-tension transition moments.Integration & Preview DetailsPreview Availability: From June 17–23, this will be the only map in the 3v3 Arena queue.Permanent Rotation: The map joins the standard Arena rotation in Season 9.Twitch Drops: Earn the Hearty Twitch Cache during the preview week by watching 6 cumulative hours of New World: Aeternum on Twitch to earn your reward.Visual Identity & LoreInspired by the Monarch’s Bluffs — a beautiful, underutilized style — this arena mixes temple ruins with organic natural elements, creating a lush-yet-foreboding battlefield. Animal motifs and spirit-worship themes are woven into the design, reinforcing the idea that this place was not simply made for combat, but for reverence… or sacrifice.“Concept art helped us lean deeper into the natural elements—juxtaposing ruin and overgrowth in a way that feels unique in the Arena ecosystem.” — Map Design TeamDeveloper InsightsBiggest Challenge: Balancing size and intensity. Throughout each match, the arena seamlessly flows from long range combat to more close range encounters.Player Feedback: Strong community desire for more variety, more scale, and better role balance helped shape every decision — from layout to pacing.Competitive Expectations: This map rewards versatility and forces adaptation. Expect meta shifts favoring hybrid builds and mobile team comps.More Maps Coming?: Not immediately, but we have concepts for maps in the pipeline if demand stays strong.Pro Tip: Don’t anchor to one position. The fight will come to you — fast. Master transition points and use cover creatively to outlast and outmaneuver.Prepare for the PreviewThis isn’t just another arena — it’s a full evolution of the 3v3 experience. Watch for callouts to emerge from the community, theorycraft new comps with your squad, and sharpen your skills across all ranges.We’ll see you in the ring — if you can survive it.",1749489790,

Elegant Sorceress’s Heeled Boots: Click-clack into combat with style that says “I hex with heels.” Evanescent Touch (Void Gauntlet Skin): A most elegant weapon from a more macabre era, perfect for the aspiring dark witch. Evanescent Star (Flail Skin): All beauty, all bite. Let your flail do the screaming. The Danse Macabre Bundle won’t linger in the void forever. Be sure to grab it before it vanishes into mist.

1063730,New World: Aeternum Update 1.3.27,"Greetings, Adventurers! New World: Aeternum Update 1.3.27 downtime will begin at 5:00 AM PT (1200 UTC) on June 3rd and last approximately 1.5 hours. Check out the full release notes, including other notable fixes, below. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/5WjyT9PeUbdmbihocgl6t2/7d032d374ca8a288ff0632bbbf1fba4f/NWA_S8AnnouncementScreenshots_EventRewards_Final_740x416_WEB_CT-000017375.jpg Seasonal Server 2 Seasonal Server 2 is our take on a hardcore experience. We’ve built this to reward you for flexing your mastery and knowledge of the game. Additionally, we want to open up all the content for all our players in this time limited experience. The major changes we have made for this server are: No Main Questline - We’ve built a new, very expedited quest line to follow. This questline will give you all the experience needed for your character to reach maximum level in approximately 6 hours. It will also introduce you to the new mechanic we’re using for progressing your character on this server, Azerite Tailings. Azerite Tailings - Azerite Tailings are an item that can be dropped from multiple different locations in the world and can be used to craft new types of inventory caches for yourself. These caches will be much faster to use for gearing up your character on this server than standard loot drops. These caches can provide everything you need for your characters (such as consumables, gear, and even materials for selecting perks on artifacts.) Artifacts Unlimited - On this server, you are able to equip as many artifacts as you would like. We don’t know exactly how powerful these can become, but we want to allow you to experiment in some new ways and try some new gameplay combinations that even we haven’t seen before. Death Status Effects - A new status effect will be present on your character when created on this server for tracking your Unfallen or Fallen state, and this is our attempt at a different kind of hardcore experience. Characters who have not died will be considered ‘Unfallen’ and characters who have died will be considered ‘Fallen’. Instead of a traditional hardcore model, where your character is simply deleted on death, this status effect will stack up, granting 25 bonus attributes per stack. However, some challenges can only be completed in an Unfallen state. Group up with others to tackle these objectives and remain Unfallen, but don’t be afraid to keep going if you do Fall, you’ll be getting stronger and stronger. War has its own unique status effect. This status effect will provide a higher potential stacking on attributes after death (as well as a damage bonus), but it also reduces your armor and absorptions while active (this is intended to help balance out some of the potential defensive power artifacts can provide). Since this is a time limited server, territory control is not the primary focus, so we wanted to give people an opportunity to experience the mode in a different way. Honestly, we’re hoping you will all go out into the field and bonk each other over the head with foam bats and cardboard tubes for a weekend. Earnable Rewards - You will be able to earn new rewards for your character by completing challenges in the Season Journey on this server. These new earnable rewards are Raw Orichalcite Stone which allows you to craft any artifact you want (out of all the artifacts you do not currently own), and Runewood Resin which allows you to craft any T3 trophy you want. There will also be new cosmetics and titles to earn throughout this experience. These rewards will not be claimable on your seasonal character and must be claimed on one of your primary characters. Important extra note about the Hardcore server: As the focus of this server is push the limit of characters to the max, including using full sets of artifacts in endgame content such as the Gorgon raid, players will be required to have the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion to participate. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/3xD3szaYdhfJ6qROLQqZDv/663ad2962eb063287f40d0656e3973f3/NWA_S8AnnouncementScreenshots_WorldBoss_Mahantaram_Final_1920x1080_WEB_CT-000017375.jpg Expeditions Unleashed With the release of Expeditions Unleashed, we added a dynamic health scaling system for these encounters which will scale up and down the health of creatures and bosses in the encounter based on the number of players in the encounter area. This system has both a minimum and maximum boundary to the scaling and a per player increment. Our intention with this system is that more players should always be a benefit, but except in critically large player numbers, fight duration should be longer and more consistent than it was in past boss events. With our initial release we set our boundaries to fairly conservative numbers to ensure the system would not have a negative impact to server health due to the longer fights. After reviewing the data from live servers and player sentiment, we’ve seen a positive impact in fight duration within o...",1748884968,

Expedition threats are breaking free. With Expeditions Unleashed, we’re bringing some of New World: Aeternum’s most fearsome bosses out of the dungeons and into the open world. Event Details: Prepare to face three of Aeternum’s most formidable foes—this time, outside the safety of Expedition walls. During Expeditions Unleashed, iconic bosses will emerge into the open world on a rotating schedule. Players Item Level 65+ can take on these world-threatening enemies for rewards: * Stampeding Devourer (Mammoth): May 20 – May 26 * Golden Scarab Lord Kephri: June 17 – June 23 * Infernal Ifrit: July 15 – July 21 What are World Boss encounters? World Bosses are open-world, large-scale versions of iconic Expedition bosses. These timed events spawn across specific locations throughout Aeternum. Players can trigger the encounter by attacking enemies at the event site, much like Baalphazu or the Winter Warrior events. Once activated, a powerful boss will emerge—ready to be taken down by anyone brave enough to stand against it. Do I need a group to participate? There’s no matchmaking or group requirement, but these encounters are designed for teamwork. You’re welcome to join solo, but you’ll likely need help from fellow adventurers to take these enemies down. Are there special mechanics or unique challenges? While these bosses retain their expedition roots, many of their attacks and mechanics have been rebalanced and redesigned to create dynamic, large-scale fights in an open-world environment. Expect familiar mechanics with new twists, scaled to threaten dozens of players at once. What’s in it for me? World Bosses don’t just bring the spectacle—they bring the loot. Each encounter offers a mix of guaranteed gear, powerful upgrade materials, and exclusive collectibles, with multiple chances to earn high-end rewards every day. Open World Boss Rewards Normal Reward Box (Unlimited per day) * 100%: 1 Weapon, Armor, or Jewelry piece * 66%: Gear Score 700 Procedural Weapon or Armor * 33%: Named Legendary Gear Score 710 Item (see Boss Rewards below) * 100%: 2–3 Level-appropriate Potions Bonus Reward Box (3 per day) * 100%: Named Legendary Gear Score 710 Item (see Boss Rewards) * 100%: 1 Black Gypsum * 100%: 25 Dark Matter * 25%: Named Legendary Gear Score 725 Weapon (see Boss Rewards, 1 per week) * 10%: Jaeger Skin Set Box (1 per week) * Contains 1 piece of the Jaeger Set: * Jaeger’s Cunning (Head) * Jaeger’s Spite (Chest) * Jaeger’s Pluck (Hand) * Jaeger’s Grit (Legs) * Jaeger’s Advance (Feet) Pity System * To prevent unlucky streaks, a pity counter guarantees the following after opening 12 Bonus Boxes: * 100%: 1 Named GS 725 Weapon (if not already earned that week) * 100%: 1 Jaeger Skin Set Box (if not already earned that week) Boss-Specific Loot Each boss drops a distinct set of legendary Gear Score 710 weapons, armor, and jewelry—with a rare chance at an exclusive GS 725 weapon, once per week.

Expedition bosses have long been a core part of New World: Aeternum’s PvE challenge. With Expeditions Unleashed, we’re reimagining that experience—removing barriers to entry and making these iconic fights available to all players, at scale. By moving them into the open world, we’re not just turning up the threat—we’re creating shared, emergent moments across the map. You’ll see groups rally in real time, new alliances form, and stories unfold organically as players come together to face common enemies. Who are these bosses? Each World Boss is pulled from the Expedition pantheon—familiar foes now empowered for massive-scale encounters.

1063730,New World: Aeternum: Capture the Flag Preview Weekend,"Greetings Adventurers! Capture the Flag is bringing fast, focused PvP action to New World: Aeternum. Get a first look at the new mode during a limited-time preview event: Preview Event Start: Friday, May 16 Preview Event End: Monday, May 19 Capture the Flag offers a new way to dive into intense, short-duration matches where quick decisions and sharp teamwork make all the difference. The goal behind Capture the Flag was simple: create a PvP mode that’s instantly understandable, endlessly replayable, and a true test of quick thinking under pressure. Pick a Role, Play Your Way Every Capture the Flag match is a balance of offense, defense, and rapid adaptation. Players naturally fall into roles — carrier, defender, chaser, protector — but how you fill that role depends entirely on your team’s strategy and your build. Carrying the flag isn’t easy. Slowed movement, increased incoming damage, and reduced healing keeps things balanced, while using certain movement abilities will cause you to drop the flag immediately. Every weapon loadout can run the flag, but not every loadout will survive the chase — smart play and teamwork are key. Battlefields Built for Speed Both Capture the Flag maps were custom-designed to support the mode’s relentless energy. They may look familiar, but every jump pad, corridor, and power-up placement was crafted to keep fights tight and thrilling. On the field, players will find: Power-ups — grab boosts to health, speed, or damage at critical moments. Jump pads — launch yourself into chaotic new angles of attack. No base defenses — defense is your responsibility. With near-instant respawns, downtime is nearly nonexistent—keeping pressure high from the moment you grab the flag to the moment you fight your way back to home base to score. Speed Meets Strategy Capture the Flag is quick to learn and satisfying to master. The mode’s simplicity makes it perfect for casual players looking for instant action, but smart coordination and team synergy will define the winners. Development for Capture the Flag wasn’t without its challenges. Tuning pickup timers, flag drop mechanics, and spawn protections took significant iteration — and the flexibility built into the mode’s backend will allow for ongoing live adjustments as the playerbase shapes how Capture the Flag is played. Early versions of the mode experimented with twists on the traditional format, but the decision to start with a classic Capture the Flag experience sets the stage for future variant modes and experiments in coming seasons. Play for Glory (and Loot) During Season 8’s Preview Weekends, Capture the Flag will reward players with standard Outpost Rush crates. There aren’t exclusive cosmetics or achievements tied to the mode yet — but capture the flag based rewards are already being explored for Season 9 and beyond. For now, the goal is pure: victory, bragging rights, and endless clutch moments. Build for the Fight While Capture the Flag’s arenas are set in recognizable parts of Aeternum, they’re competitive spaces first — designed for flow, tactics, and nonstop motion. To bring the mode to life, the team built: Custom-designed flags and power-up visuals New jump pad assets A fully voiced announcer hyping every clutch play Original music composed to match the pace of battle It’s a fresh, kinetic experience inside a world players already know. The Race Begins Capture the Flag is fast, brutal, tactical, and just getting started. Preview Weekends arrive in Season 8 — your first chance to sprint, defend, steal, and score before the mode goes live permanently. Grab your team, sharpen your builds, and get ready to run. We’ll see you in Aeternum! ",1747082979,

Welcome to our first post-launch New World: Aeternum Dev Update! It’s been a very exciting past few weeks since the release of New World: Aeternum with so many new and returning players arriving on the island. In today’s update, we’re going to walk through what to expect from the future of New World: Aeternum. We’ve been listening to players and we know how important it is for the community to be informed of and understand what is planned for the game. We’re excited to share a first look at what is coming down the road in the near term, but also, we wanted to be transparent about some of the exciting content that’s a little further out. We’ve heard you loud and clear and have been thinking hard about how we deliver updates and give more visibility into not only what the team is actively working on, but also what is in early development, and even some of our very early ideas that we’re exploring in the studio. To that end, we are releasing a new roadmap format that we are calling a Living Roadmap. Our goal with the Living Roadmap is to keep our players informed as much as we can along the way, specifically covering three categories of feature development: Next Season (short-term): What is coming in the next seasonal update. In-Development (mid-term): What is in active development and will be coming in upcoming seasons. These items will not necessarily be available in the immediate next season, but within a season or two. In-Exploration: Ideas the Dev team is discussing or exploring. These are features we’ve heard from players would be exciting for them, or that we just think would be good additions to the game. Some might move to in-development, some might fall off altogether if they are determined to not be feasible or are no-longer of interest to our players, but we want to show what we’re investigating here in the studio. There is a lot of information here to digest, and we will keep refining this process as we go. We look forward to your thoughts! https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/2DdkEKJqVb0FY8F2nyIZ7R/bcce984fc64965494ac6a2e2c53a5a17/EN_NWA_Roadmap_Update_-24_1920x1080.jpg We sat down with Scot, Dave V, Katy, Dan, and some other faces from the team to dive deep into Season 7.

Look forward to learning all about how this World will work in a future article. New Outpost Rush (OPR) Map Preview A new Outpost Rush map is coming, offering players a fresh battlefield to conquer and test their skills in this strategic PVP game mode. Outpost Rush is a team-based competition where players gather resources, capture objectives, and outmaneuver opponents in epic battles for dominance and rewards. This new map will have a preview weekend during Season 7, so keep an eye out for more details. Mutated Expedition Upgrades Unified Mutations will remove the need for multiple gear sets, add matchmaking for M3, and improve rewards for these challenging Expeditions.

Indeed, the island itself is the grandest mystery of all – located somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, protected by the ever-churning Stormwall. While people from seemingly all ages and regions find their way here eventually, so too do many of the animals native to each corner of the Earth. At this point in time, it is highly likely that adventurers have encountered most of them. But there are rumors of another, more hidden creature. To whit, and of late, a certain Dr. Aenwyn has been raising much ado throughout the settlements (even as far north as the outposts of Shattered Mountain) about a “Grate Discovery To Rival All Known Discoverys”. Her atrocious spelling aside, the volume of her voice does make this pronouncement intriguing. A new animal? Here, on Aeternum? And yet, located exactly where…? https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/3ulCNFDDzldYkE4ZpMN94q/7cf5cf04453c47a93d0f6221b348b54f/NWA_HippoMountEditorial_AlligatorFight_B_1920x1080_Final_CT-000013651.jpg Everywhere, she claims! She has supposedly seen not one hippopotamus, but rather myriad hippopotamuses of every shape and size roaming freely the island. The descriptions do make the mind boggle, question her sanity, and – dare we say – pique an interest most profoundly. Even saying the word feels a kind of magic after listening to one of her presentations. Hippopotamus. Hippopotamus! How utterly fascinating they must be! Within those five syllables is contained a bizarre and majestic world that may, perhaps, outshine what strange things have already been chronicled in Aeternum. Yet where there is new knowledge, there will surely be skepticism. Bystanders were quoted as having said, after leaving her talk in a huff when she refused to answer even basic questions from the audience: “That just sounds like a bear!” And: “We need proof!” https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/4tEoYLW6oKdJCGQrSN5ifE/2647c066aa19de484bc4c9b30b05b3ce/NWA_HippoMountEditorial_BearHippo_BearRoar_1920x1080_Final_CT-000013651.jpg As well as: “Is she actually even a doctor, does she have a valid certificate, and is it from an accredited institution at all?” Undeterred by dwindling listeners, including the occasional growing mob, Dr. Aenwyn continues onwards. You may spy her out in the fields of Everfall, down in the muck of Reekwater, or squatting atop a dune in Brimstone Sands with the most curiously pensive expression imaginable. She squints. She wonders. Is that an uncatalogued, as-yet undiscovered breed of hippopotamus over yonder? Off she dashes, pursuing her dream again with a passion that – if it cannot truly be understood – can certainly be appreciated. This will surely be a lifelong quest for the good doctor, but the mystery of hippos on Aeternum may never truly be solved in even our eternal lifetimes. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/Iu4RVCCIj8oiPeTWu35py/e5ed9c525c4873f33d9543bfb54cea0d/NWA_HippoMountEditorial_HippoEasterEgg_1920x1080_Final_CT-000013651.jpg The 'Hippo' Mount Wow, a real hippo! I can bearly believe we found one in just under 1,000 days. Continue your adventurers across Aeternum with your very own Hippo Burley mount, available now through the in-game Store. We had to ask ourselves how to take this fun idea and blend it into the style and look of New World: Aeternum, where as of yet, hippos do not exist. That kernel led us to have a little extra fun with this mount. If you decide to get it, I hope it will bring a smile to your face (as it does for us) when you're running around on a giant bear in a hippo costume. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/4QdzhB7OCzwz33KGVz7Kvs/69f76d56f7c0d38763dee7d3b1d53242/NWA_HippoMountEditorial_Discovery_1920x1080_Final_CT-000013651.jpg Concept and Creation We were looking to hit something entertaining and ridiculous with the hippo bear design. We explored a few different stylized options before trying a couple costumed ideas, as we wanted to push the comedy and turn this item into something players would really get a kick out of putting on their mount. In the end we settled on a costume made of stuffed, baggy cloth stitched together, that would sit awkwardly on the bear but not obscure it. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/62NA9s7dbVzGhlOZiULoHq/247c8ac3a9a23648e79e5af71d91203d/NWA_HippoBear_02_1920x1080.jpg Where will your search for hippos take you next?

New World: Aeternum Update 1.1.2 downtime will begin at 11:00PM PT (7:00AM UTC) on November 5 and last approximately 2 hours. Baalphazu has been banished back to the darkness, marking the end of Nightveil Hallow. This update also includes rendering changes as well as fixes to some quests. Check out the full release notes, including other notable fixes, below. World Experience Fixed an issue that caused players to receive more PvP Experience than intended in the Cursed Mists zone. Fixed an issue that prevented progress in the Syndicate: Trial of the Scrivener quest and Faction rank advancement. Fixed an issue that caused several repeatable Expedition quests to not contribute to the ""Repeat Offender"" Season Journey task. Fixed an issue that caused players to phase into certain objects when accessing menus while vaulting. Rendering PC DX12 Beta Client: Added FSR native resolution TAA (Temporal Anti-Aliasing) only mode Added FSR sharpness control Improved the stability of our DX12 renderer FSR - Console/PC DX12: Improved visual quality of the FSR upscale Fixed rendering artifacts that could occur during FSR upscaling Fixed an issue in which emissive materials were not properly rendering, causing an unintended blue glow on several weapons. Fixed an issue in which some weapon effects would appear overly blown-out, especially in heavy combat scenarios. Fixed Depth-of-Field shimmering in certain lighting conditions (most notable during in-game cinematics). Notable Fixes Identified and fixed a rare crash that could occur if a player's client has a corrupted install which causes certain texture files to be invalid. In these cases we will instead render a basic white texture, allowing players to proceed into the game. Players who see this white texture should validate their installation files afterwards to try to correct any prior installation issues. Fixed an issue that prevented players on PC from progressing if they had Old Wounds ready for turn in before the release of New World: Aeternum. Fixed an issue that caused the 3v3 Arena end of match UI to not display properly. Fixed an issue that prevented nameplates from appearing. Thanks for your support!

From voiceovers (VO) to sound design, discover how the Audio Team designed Nightveil Hallow. Once you’ve learned more about the voice and sound effects behind Baalphazu, confront the Marquis of Terror in-game for event-specific rewards before Nightveil Hallow ends on November 5. Voiceovers Salvatore Casting Baalphazu and Salvatore was rather unusual compared to how we typically handle that process. Starting with Salvatore, they wanted to have this voice pay homage to some of the great actors from the golden age of horror films like Vincent Price, Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Lon Chaney. This became a rather challenging request to find just the right voice. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/3uReRDehPo37zX2LWFFNoU/0c97f4b4ccb1098e0af7b40f7c5458d3/NW_Salvatore_NightVeilHallow_03_1920x1080_Web_CT-001067.jpg After reviewing dozens of reels from voice actors, I was chatting with one of our wonderful directors. They shared a general joy and excitement for the character, suggested some folks, and then later that day sent me an email out of the blue. Attached was a recording of an excerpt from The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe. Much to our delight, and from the initial confusion of “yes, that’s a perfect voice,"" to ""if only we could find an actor to do something similar,” we had cast our Salvatore. We were sitting on pins and needles, nervous but excited during the first recording session. As soon as it started, the entire crew was grinning from ear to ear. A few of us couldn’t help but chime in during breaks and pauses to sing our praises about how he sounded just like one of those golden age actors. Baalphazu We knew from a design perspective that Baalphazu was going to be really intense and vocally very straining. So, we wanted to make sure whoever we cast for the role could handle screeches, screams, growls and more. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/5YsPyqIJNMxGstmR28GmhQ/4446c947847bd494197bb69cf75196b2/NW_Baalphazu_Combat_C_NightVeilHallow_01_1920x1080_Web_CT-001067.jpg The voice behind Baalphazu is Molly Scarpine, an incredibly talented metal vocalist who just so happens to specialize in extreme creature vocals. Molly was recommended to us initially by our Director Maddie Stratton as a “hey, check out this vocalist and her band. They’re really cool.” After hearing Molly’s music, we knew we had to get her in for something awesome. Then this boss came around, handed to me as a lovely gift. Molly was such a wonderful person to record with and gave us a plethora of variations for each line. I just have this vivid memory of Molly shrugging and calling out that she’s doing great after being asked how she’s feeling, and then going in for the next take. Easily one of the coolest sessions I’ve ever had the pleasure of attending. Baalphazu Voice Design Holiday content is always a lot of fun to work on, and I think Halloween might be my favorite. The dark and scary nature of the holiday opens up a huge amount of possibilities for sound design. You can push the envelope into weird and creative territories to enrich the experience. Starting with great source material makes the remainder of the process an absolute joy. The unique vocal tonalities that Molly can achieve, in addition to the raw emotion that comes through in the recording, gave Baalphazu their own unique voice, even before the VO design. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/4aFu3z1OWBfphF1WgN2CNn/56ea10cd2914842d5504d2877b6a58db/NW_NightveilHallow_Screenshots_Baalphazu_Combat_Final_1920x1080_CT-002723.jpg We knew the voice needed to evoke terror, and strike fear into the hearts of all who inhabit the island. With that in mind, I started by splitting the voice into three separate channels for unique processing. The first layer was meant to provide clarity in the spoken line. I used very light pitch and delay processing to give it a bit of a larger than life feel, but was careful about going too far and making the lines unintelligible. This gave the voice an eerie, demonic doubling effect. The next two layers were where I wanted to take advantage of the strange nature of Halloween and push it into something weird, horrifying, and unique. I was inspired by a sound we all know and hate, nails on a chalkboard. I found that you can get similar, but unique results from sliding a shower ring across a metal rod. I took these unsettling sounds and used an envelope follower, which mirrored the amplitude of the VO lines, to bring that texture into the voice. The final layer was where I went nuts. I threw everything and the kitchen sink at it to see what would happen. The result ended up being a low-pitched layer with some aggressive modulation. I used a slight reversal effect along with a formant filter hooked up to an LFO to give a constant tonal shift that somewhat mim...",1730304513,

Shrieks in the night! The demon Baalphazu, Marquis of Terror, and his horde of ghoulish Pumpkinites are spreading a living nightmare across Aeternum. Aid Salvatore the Mad in his quest to banish these foul terrors and collect a bounty of Nightveil Hallow rewards. We spoke to the Design, Narrative, and AI Teams for insight into various aspects of the event. Let’s find out some of the tricks that brought you this Halloween treat. You’ll also get a glimpse at early Nightveil Hallow concept art from before Baalphazu could cast their first shadow over Aeternum. Inspiration The direction of Nightveil Hallow was greatly inspired by 80s horror movies, specifically the awesome creature-flicks and fun-spirited ‘schlocky’ tone of the era. As a Halloween and horror-fanatic, it was a blast to work with the team to mix all the pieces that make 80s horror so iconic, and present them within the realm of Aeternum. Baalphazu and his Pumpkinites convey a theme that should hopefully feel familiar to fans of the genre and season, while Salvatore is a classic throwback to the golden age of horror cinema icons. Event Goals The goal of every holiday event is to ensure it’s unmistakable to players that a special event is happening in Aeternum. With that, the playfully decorated settlements round out Nightveil Hallow. It is the team’s seal on our love letter to the spookiest time of year! References in the Event Shop Rewards https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/70yzDV4gR2kLdpssSLJ6Ig/1d1cb52565d5c2499562cc1ee02127d7/NW_NightveilHallow_Screenshots_Costumes_Final_1920x1080_CT-002723.jpg The reverence Nightveil Hallow holds for the spooky season is most apparent in the Event Shop and incredible rewards players can earn during the event. I’m certain fans of the genre will pick up on the inspirations for a few of the items, but there’s one hidden-in-plain-sight reference I’m particularly curious if anyone will catch. The Creation of Baalphazu When conceiving the demon Baalphazu, we wanted to hint at the existence of other parallel worlds. The Netherworld is a mysterious realm of shadows and nightmares, where the dark figure of Lord Tenebrous rules over the Host, a collection of goblins, ghouls, and other terrors. Baalphazu is one of the Netherworld’s dread captains, eager to carry out the will of his twisted master by spreading fear throughout the island of immortals. Naming Baalphazu We tossed a few names around when conceiving this demon. When it comes to New World, our goal is to have creatures and NPCs that are familiar but still uniquely Aeternum. I was fond of the name ‘Belphegor’ while another developer favored ‘Pazuzu’ so it’s easy to see how we settled on Baalphazu. Pumpkinites https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/36vygzzFkQ77tzcnnS2EbJ/d25d3a619cf475b2451c9e9ae05c4765/NW_HalloweenPlaguer_Combat_NightVeilHallow_01_1920x1080_Web_CT-001067.jpg Any new holiday event starts with establishing the ""reason for the season,"" or the major shift that causes all of the associated festivities. The conceptualization of the Pumpkinites was that first step toward developing the overall framework of Nightveil Hallow. The idea of monstrous pumpkin creatures running amok across Aeternum was too fun to pass on, and the Concept/AI Teams did a killer job developing each one to convey their own sense of personality and purpose. Of the bunch, the Pumpklin is the one I’d consider to be the mascot of the event, as it’s a direct homage to the “small creature” horror films of the 80s. I can totally see this little guy standing claw-to-claw against the Critters. Pumpklins Despite being the smallest and most fodder creature of the bunch, the Pumpklins were a deceivingly intricate mob to create, as they are vital to defeating Baalphazu. The concept of defeating an enemy and picking up its head to throw at others was as wild to pitch as it was to develop. A lot of new tech had to be created and there were many moving parts. It was a cross-departmental effort. Everyone involved with the process did such an amazing job, it’s immensely satisfying mowing them down by the dozens and seeing their heads fly across the battlefield. I’m incredibly excited the Pumpklin is now a permanent fixture of Aeternum, and can’t wait to see what other shenanigans it can get itself into. Baalphazu Boss Fight https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/5YsPyqIJNMxGstmR28GmhQ/4446c947847bd494197bb69cf75196b2/NW_Baalphazu_Combat_C_NightVeilHallow_01_1920x1080_Web_CT-001067.jpg Controlled chaos is how I’d best describe the primary creative design pillar of the fight. It’s fast and hectic, but includes a large boss space to create a more epic atmosphere in two ways — many players can participate without feeling too crowded, and Baalphazu and the Pumpkinites have a lot of room to move. I love how Baalphazu's dialogue and ta...",1729792403,

On top of that, we’ve added more endgame content including our first raid, the Hive of Gorgons, which is the culmination of our PvE experience, and a Free-For-All PvP zone the Cursed Mists, where adventurers can test their skills and grab awesome loot! We’ve also rebuilt the way we tell the story to really immerse players in the world. So with that, we are extremely excited to embark on this journey together. Launch is just the starting point and we have big plans for where we want to go next. We will continue to listen and use your feedback to inform our future updates.

We have made the following changes to target lock. Note that these changes only affect PvP—PvE still behaves as it did before. Killing a PvP opponent in target lock will no longer automatically switch to another target. This led to situations where an ability in progress would instantly target another player when the current target was killed. This maneuver wouldn’t be possible with manual aiming on keyboard and mouse so we removed it. Target lock now breaks more aggressively when losing line of sight to your target. Breaking line of sight even briefly will lose the lock, which allows easier evasion and better preserves stealthy gameplay in PvP. A character’s turn speed is now slower when using target lock. We’ve slowed the character’s turn speed when using target lock. This results in a slower tracking speed for targets, meaning that homing attacks will miss more often on a moving target. Temporary - Blunderbuss now deals less damage in PvP We agree with the player feedback that the guaranteed hit just doesn’t feel right. To mitigate this, we temporarily reduced the Blunderbuss's base damage in PvP to compensate for the guaranteed hit. We will continue to investigate long term solutions to be implemented in the near future. Cross-world Arenas & Improved Matchmaking https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/3kTnY3cQvxzXhafpGt6mis/42795f429d2910f2b4e0985fa58bbf2c/NW_Combat_B_PVPArena_S2Announce_1920x1080_Final_CT-001711.jpg Finding matches in 3v3 Arenas will now be much easier thanks to cross-world matchmaking. We’ve also introduced skill-based matchmaking to both Arenas and Outpost Rush. Look forward to higher quality matches against other players of similar skill. Finally, we’ve added role selection to these modes. Similar to Expeditions, we will now split roles better between teams for a more balanced experience.

1063730,"New World Aeternum won't have awful server queues, Amazon says","I remember when New World launched back in 2021. There were colossal server queues, disconnects, and a whole lot of hysterical laughter turned crying as you finally hit the shores of Aeternum, and were promptly yeeted back to the main menu. While I forged unique bonds with my then-colleagues, feeling like we'd experienced something the rest of the globe would never quite understand, it's no secret that server issues are incredibly annoying. Speaking to <strong>New World Aeternum</strong>'s senior producer Katy Kaszynski in an exclusive PCGamesN interview, I ask how the team is planning to ensure a smooth launch for its fresh take on its magical MMO. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world-aeternum/server-interview"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world/aeternum-pvp-zone"">New World Aeternum details how its free-for-all PvP zone will work</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world-aeternum/guide"">New World Aeternum release date and changes explained</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world-aeternum/open-beta"">New World Aeternum open beta lets you try the reborn MMORPG for free</a> ",1728395051,
1063730,New World Aeternum details how its free-for-all PvP zone will work,"PvP is probably the hardest thing to master in an MMO. Some games somewhat shove it to the sidelines like World of Warcraft, others focus on it like Throne and Liberty, and some simply excel at having a thriving community enjoying all that it can offer, as in the case of the Elder Scrolls Online. Occasionally, however, a new idea comes along that really shakes things up, and that looks to be the case in the upcoming relaunched MMO, <strong>New World Aeternum</strong>. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world/aeternum-pvp-zone"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world-aeternum/server-interview"">New World Aeternum won't have awful server queues, Amazon says</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world-aeternum/guide"">New World Aeternum release date and changes explained</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/new-world-aeternum/open-beta"">New World Aeternum open beta lets you try the reborn MMORPG for free</a> ",1728342840,

1063730,The Cursed Mists PvP Zone Deep Dive,"https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/4XynXj2FCLbVmy3mf6v8Gz/db5816ff33b21743088ec1b839781407/new_world_aeternum_caveexploratin_cutlasskeys_1920x1080.jpg Greetings, Adventurers! The foggy southwest reaches of Cutlass Keys are a lawless place, where the “Golden Greed” curse of La Esperanza’s treasure drives fortune-hunters to murderous madness. Even the closest of companions are liable to lethally betray one another. Gather Cursed Doubloons and resources, but you’ll have to escape before other looters steal your spoils. Get an inside look into the Cursed Mists before it releases on October 15 alongside New World: Aeternum. Massive Murder Balls of Allied Players Any new feature this complicated is going to require a lot of playtesting. During all of that testing, we discovering unexpected, but entertaining, issues. Early on, it was possible for PvE players to ranged attack or heal lawless, free-for-all PvP players from outside the zone border. You can imagine the shenanigans that followed. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/Ui4xFDH6hrY33Rh1UnOxl/295e4835f5bfa81e5f42dc55b45d41f4/new_world_aeternum_pvp_cutlasskeyspvparea_1920x1080.jpg We were delighted to find that many of the riskier features worked as well or better than imagined, often with hilarious results. Trying to collude with other players isn’t a bad strategy, but it’s horrifyingly easy to accidentally, or “accidentally,” catch friends in AoEs when the fighting gets hectic. I fondly recall lots of laughing, yelling, and sometimes sincere apologies. It’s also a bittersweet treat to see the person who just murdered you pop up at a respawn point seconds after you, having perished to something like your Bleed or Smolder. “Well, we BOTH lost that one, didn’t we?” I actually partnered up with someone that way. We rushed back across the border to see if our dropped loot was still on the ground. It wasn’t. Someone luckier, or smarter, than us had come across it, but hey, it’s the friends we made along the way, right…? https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/XFGcXm9EVBZC1jAFXKoNJ/a0d73b851533344f3b82326746e84a82/NWA_Announce_Vista_CutlessKeysPVP_ConsoleLaunch_V2_1920x1080.jpg We want to discourage massive murder balls of allied players. There’s always going to be collusion, but we don’t want to make it easy. We implemented a new free-for-all system that eliminates all group, Company, and Faction ties. Even if you’re fighting alongside friends, it’s very easy to accidentally harm or kill one another. We also implemented a new crowd control system that keeps players from lingering in large packs for too long. Lastly, loot chests function like normal resources. Once looted, they’re unavailable to all other players until the respawn. The Unique Thrill of PvP We believe in the strength of our PvP combat, not to mention the unique thrill of PvP, and always look for more ways to engage both PvP and PvE players with enticing rewards. This time, we wanted to deliver more free-form, always-available PvP experiences, rather than relying on instances, scheduled events, and matchmaking queues. https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/4Ts6Y9gsKaC8Zfg76HrtjQ/99612ac015282992990e96212a1165b3/NWA_CKEnv_06_1920x1080.jpg That desire to bring new forms of gameplay to Aeternum culminated in a voluntary free-for-all, open-world space. There are light extraction mechanics, extra room for those who prefer to sneak around, and a surplus of loot for every Adventurer. Our hope is the easy access and bountiful spoils tempt even the staunchest of PvE players to take a dip in the pool. It’s full of treasure, after all. It’s really its own animal as a high-stakes, on-the-fly experience without strictly structured times or reward caps. Cutlass Keys’ Cursed Mists zone is one of three ways to acquire new 700+ gear, and potentially the best option for solo players. There are also some fantastic Named Items and Artifacts that reward the greater risk. Cursed Treasure Economy https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/1Sx4ZWSnFjOrn1eE4BsYNN/44d0874a4e894e8692010846841116eb/NWA_CKEnv_02_1920x1080.jpg Building a new currency with fresh ways to acquire resources, determining how many you’ll lose with each death, and designing new rewards to spend them on, is always a challenge. It is crucial to the ultimate success of the experience. No matter how fun content is from a gameplay standpoint, most players need compelling incentives too. Despite simultaneously updating, improving, and adding to New World for the release of New World: Aeternum, the team’s done a great job building a gorgeous, unique set of spaces, assembling new free-for-all crowd and population control systems, and building Cutlass Keys' new cursed treasure PvP/PvE economy. A Revamped Cutlass Keys There were a few zones in the game we thought could benefit from updates, as well as serve as proving grounds for new types of gameplay: Cutlass Keys, Mourningdale, Restless Shores, and arguably even Reekwater.

1063730,Feast for the Future - From New World to the Real World,"https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/5G5u0Id5NxOMjK50r7MY5C/042a4148a1c6f0c331b331f046dcb816/NWA_Announce_Rescource_Gathering_1920x1080.jpg Greetings, Adventurers! Amazon Games and New World are taking part in the 2024 Playing for the Planet Green Game Jam. The Green Game Jam is an annual project organized by Playing for the Planet where gaming studios are challenged to implement 'green activations' into their games. This year’s event is about making small changes to the way we eat to drive demand for more sustainable food sources. As part of our Feast for the Future Recipe Design Contest, we partnered with players to design a sustainable in-game cooking dish. While resources in Aeternum may respawn infinitely, we must consider the environmental impact of our choices in the real world. Aeternum is self sustaining. No matter how much Banana Pudding and other delicacies are devoured, food sustainability is never a concern for the inhabitants of the Eternal Isle. Whether you forage into the bioluminescent jungle of the Elysian Wilds or scavenge through the ancient ruins of Brimstone Sands, there is abundance and no waste — a paradise for food sustainability. In the real world, what we eat and where it comes from impacts our world in significant ways. From land use to transportation, processing, and packaging, greenhouse gas emissions are an unfortunate consequence of each step. Some sources of food have more significant impacts than others, especially for your own well-being. How does New World compare to the real world? How much of the food types did players craft? What were the top recipes prepared? Check out our Feast for the Future infographic to see how Aeternum compares to our world. Key Takeaways https://images.ctfassets.net/j95d1p8hsuun/56RXa8pD3ZCfCtJtpGpttf/6af7e84c6b835282d4e5e978921610ab/Feast-for-the-Future-Infographic-SM.jpg Meat and Dairy recipes comprise the majority of crafted consumables in Aeternum with over 800 million (67%) crafted. Total Vegetarian and Vegan dishes crafted surpassed 400 million (33%). If Aeternum was real and not eternally self-sustaining, the impact on food sustainability would be significant. Meat and Dairy consumption have the most significant impact on greenhouse emissions from land, feed, processing, and waste while non-meat food have reduced impacts across these categories. With a global average consumption of meat and dairy around 30%, any further increase in greenhouse gasses would mean significant deforestation, water scarcity, biodiversity due to natural habitat loss, and the pollution of air, soil, and waterways. Not even the all-powerful Azoth Tree would survive. To learn more about our food and specific sources of what we eat, visit “Our World In Data” for an interactive look at the impacts across the supply chain.
