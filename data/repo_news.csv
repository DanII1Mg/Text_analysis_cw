3241660,Introducing VEHICLES to R.E.P.O.,"Hey hey semibots! It’s Friday and that means a devlog for you guys! For those of you who’d like to read instead of watching the video, here’s the key takeaways: INTRODUCING VEHICLES Together with cosmetics, we’re introducing vehicles to R.E.P.O. A fun and speedy way to traverse the level. The Semiscooter can be purchased in the shop. We are looking into a system where vehicles gets damaged over time and has to get repaired (instead of having a battery like other items). Adding vehicles to R.E.P.O. also opens up a creative door for future levels, where we can adapt and have vehicles in mind when designing them. Other fun stuff is coming as well, but more will be revealed in the final devlog of the year, launching next Friday. Have a lovely, beautiful weekend! You deserve it! Bye bye! /semiwork",1765555528,

3241660,WE FOUND A R.E.P.O. HUMAN SURVIVOR! (And Q&A Questions!),"Hey hey semibots! Today’s video introduces the very first and important introduction of a HUMAN SURVIVOR, together with the final Q&A before THE MONSTER UPDATE launches next week on October 30th! For those of you who’d like to read instead of watching the video, here are some important key questions: Q: Which monster was the hardest to make? A: This is kind of hard to answer. They all have their own challenges and things to solve. Q: Will skins be added in this update? A: Not in this update, but we are looking into it. Q: Do you intend to put boss monsters in the game? Special monsters that appear every X levels. A: Yes there has been talks about boss monsters, but nothing is set in stone. Q: Will any monsters have special interactions with items or things that only the player can use? A: Depending on what this question means, one of the upcoming monsters can interact with items in a way. So yes and no. Q: What is your favorite monster in R.E.P.O.? A: The majority of the people at Semiwork would say Headman, he was the first monster created, being in the game back when the R.E.P.O. project was known as “Clean”. Q: Will older monsters get new updated abilities, like the Huntsman saying things to make players laugh. A: We have no plans on changing the original monsters, they’re good as they are. Q: Will you add cosmetics for monsters? A: We haven’t thought about it, but it sounds like fun! So maybe. Q: How do you make the sounds and voices for the monsters? A: Robin is responsible for all sounds in the game. People in the office or friends sometimes make voices and then Robin tinkers with his sound magic. Q: Will there be different monster variations, like a snow model for them in McJannek Station? A: That would be really fun to do. We will put it on our very long “fun-to-do list”. Q: Will you add equipment or upgrades that can only found on levels (not buyable in shop) A: This is another one of those “would be fun to do”. This is a maybe, for now! Q: Will there be new semibot expressions? A: No, not in this update. Bye bye! /semiwork",1761314032,
3241660,TEASING the NEW MONSTERS coming to R.E.P.O.,"Hey hey semibots!

And for those who’d like to read instead of watching the video: Scary new monsters The Monster Update will, you guessed it, include several new monsters. We are very adamant that each new monster feels unique and unlike all the other monsters already available. We’re aiming for each monster to be scary, funny or both. Lots of new valuables We’ve gone back to the older levels and made a lot of new valuables for each level, meaning that each level will now have its own unique themed valuables (like the Museum’s valuables). Some of these valuables also have some fun and interesting interactions! More areas/rooms in The Museum The Museum of Human Art is getting new rooms and areas for you to explore - everything from cozy campfire sites to gritty eroded hallways.

3241660,50 RAPID QUESTIONS with R.E.P.O. DEV,"Hey hey semibots!This week we are answering a final batch of questions from our discord before the update releases! We have a Discord Quest active right now until the 24th of June! Grab the Discord Quest here: https://discord.com/quests/1383204882638700714 Here's the Q and A for you that prefer text:Discord Collaboration❓ Discord Quest? 💬 Yes—it’s live right now (gnomes not invited) and runs until 24 June.❓ But what’s in it for me? 💬 Play Repo for 15 minutes with Discord running to unlock the exclusive “I ❤ Repo” avatar decoration.❓ Oh my lord, how can I get this Discord Quest? 💬 Hit the link in the above (or the one Discord has already sent it to you).Gameplay & Content❓ Will there be any upgrades for the carts? 💬 Absolutely— If you count the Cart Cannon and Cart Laser as cart upgrades.❓ Will we ever get team-wide shared upgrades? 💬 It’s high on our “would-be-cool” list.❓ Is an outdoor map in development? 💬 Not actively, but it’s definitely on that same “would-be-cool” list.❓ Will other maps get museum-style, location-specific variations? 💬 Yes—older maps will be brought up to the museum’s standard over time.❓ After valuables run out, can they respawn? 💬 No. If you smash everything and still can’t make quota, you’ll need to accept defeat. We might look into some sort of life line though.❓ Will the museum include laser alarms? 💬 Yep—get ready to Mission: Impossible your way past laser security modules.❓ Will there be more verticality in the museum map? 💬 Tons. It’s a weird modern museum full of platforming and height changes.❓ Will there be new monsters in this update? 💬 Not in Update 1, but existing monsters got balance tweaks.❓ Are completely new areas planned after the museum? 💬 Yes—new area types are coming post-museum.❓ Will there be co-op puzzles or challenge rooms? 💬 We’re experimenting with them; they won’t land in the first update. ❓ Will there be more set traps? 💬 Not in Update 1, no.❓ Will the museum have any outdoor modules like Headman Manor? 💬 Yes — in the update after this one we will add some outside areas to the museum.❓ Can the onion in the chair at the museum become grabbable? 💬 Why would you grab an onion? They’re toxic and could kill you!Weapons & Tools❓ Will there be more unique guns like the Photon Blaster? 💬 Definitely—Update 1 adds several brand-new, one-of-a-kind weapons.❓ Will you make the Cart Cannon aim vertically? 💬 You already can—just grab and rotate it (a bit wonky, but it works). ❓ Will there be instruments or noisemakers just for fun?💬 Maybe someday — sounds fun, but we’d need anti-troll safeguards for public lobbies.Graphics & Performance❓ Will there be “potato” graphics options? 💬 Repo already runs well on low-end machines, but dynamic shadows are core to the game, so true “potato” mode isn’t planned.Cosmetics & Expressions❓ Will there be dancing or emotes? 💬 Discussed, but for this update we focused on new facial expressions.❓ Will there be more expressions? 💬 We added everything that felt essential; modders will no doubt add more.❓ Is there a possibility for custom facial expressions? 💬 You can already combine several expressions at once; for deeper customisation, mods are your friend.❓ Will cart skins be a thing? 💬 Maybe—if demand is there we’ll look into it during the cosmetics pass.❓ Will we ever get the twerk emote? 💬 Unsure the semibots have enough junk in the trunk for that one! ❓ Will you add kissing and touching hands into R.E.P.O.? 💬 No need — you can already kiss (do a kiss sound and slam your head into your friend) and hold a hand (grab the hand valuable in the museum) in-game.❓ Will there be toggleable player expressions? 💬 Already in! Just tap once to toggle an expression instead of holding the button.Monetisation❓ Will there be a Repo Battle Pass, Premium, NFTs, loot boxes, etc.? 💬 No. You buy the game once, you have the game—no micro-transactions ever.Audio & Art❓ Will there be new music? 💬 Yes—Robin composed an entirely new soundtrack for the museum.❓ Can you add fan art to the museum gallery? 💬 Legal headaches make that tough, but we’re planning other ways to showcase community art. ❓ What’s your favourite art in the museum? 💬 Sir Semibotsworth III – an actual painting hanging in our office, and it’s glorious.❓ What inspired the museum’s overall look and interior? 💬 We toured modern museums, then asked “what if this place were abandoned?” (plus a field-trip to a toy museum to study valuables).Lore❓ Why did you rename Avant Guard to the Museum of Human Art? 💬 Play-testers called it “the museum” anyway, and the new name fits the lore you’ll piece together.❓ Will there be more lore to discover in the museum? 💬 Absolutely—explore thoroughly! ❓ Are the dev-log skits canon to the R.E.P.O. timeline?💬 Treat the skits as official Semiwork-studio lore; the real game canon is inside R.E.P.O. itself.Quality-of-Life & Tutorials❓ Will the devs add an interactive tutorial for me? 💬 It’s already in—please do it!❓ Will there be a public matchmaking / server list? 💬 Yes...",1750405298,
