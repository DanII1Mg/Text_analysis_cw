Plus, we're happy to report it really SLAPS! With more than 1100 reviews it currently enjoys an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating, with more than 95% players recommending the game. https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/38371631/18684ae3b765836c7dde86fa69ffe2737dfcac06.gif Yes, Hyperstrange really pulled this one off. The game is good and the release has been relatively bug-free despite the 2-week delay made explicitly to implement some bugs and stay on-brand. But it wouldn't be a POSTAL release if something haven't gone wrong. Many of you were waiting for the release of the POSTAL: Brain Damaged Official Soundtrack. The wait is finally over! The OST has arrived, and you can get it separately or bundled with the official Art Book in the POSTAL: Brain Damaged - Connoisseur Edition. UPCOMING UPDATES The Hyperstrange Dev team is very grateful for the amazing reception of PBD. This gives them even more motivation to improve and expand the game post-release. Here's what to expect soon: Post-release fix - an update taking care of the known issues reported by the players, that slipped into the full release (ETA: One week) Balancing update - some players, as well as some internet micro-celebrities, have brought to our attention that the game offers way to much ammo if you explore the levels 'Quake-style', and far too little if you prefer to push on 'Doom Eternal-style'. The update will take care of that issue, allowing everyone to enjoy the game in their preferred playstyle. The update will also reconfigure some of the enemy positioning, spawns, and behavior. (ETA: One month) New playmodes - With that taken care of, the dev team will proceed to expanding the game itself, introducing an oft-requested horde mode, as well as another playmode offering a new, and replayable PBD experience. (ETA: This summer) More to be announced! Hyperstrange and RWS are both extremely pleased with the reception of POSTAL: Brain Damaged. We're as excited as you are, to see what the future will bring to this explosive and twisted spin-off. Your true friends and family, Hyperstrange & RWS",1655488282,

232770,"“POSTAL: Brain Damaged” Revealed at Realms Deep 2020, Coming to PC & Consoles","{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/36009824/535588b93fb0ff20b46c94bb676e1685184f9a2e.jpg POSTAL: Brain Damaged, the retro-styled FPS spin-off from Running With Scissors’ outrageous series enjoyed by millions, will deliver crude and immature humor, ridiculous weapons, and old school challenge to PC and consoles in 2021. Developed by Hyperstrange (developers of ELDERBORN) and CreativeForge Games to be published by Running With Scissors, POSTAL: Brain Damaged gives a tantalizing taste of the madness to come in its debut trailer, revealed today at Realms Deep 2020. One too many hits to the head (and hits off the pipe) has everyone’s favorite bathrobed anti-hero, The POSTAL Dude, reeling from brain damage. When he closes his eyes in a drunken, drugged-up stupor, he awakens in a psychedelic, grotesque, utterly twisted dream world. Asylum patients with dildo arms charge ravenously. Serial killer grandmas wield walkers in cut-throat combat. Beware probe-happy aliens reaching for the backside of The POSTAL Dude’s bathrobe. Shoot through stages of escalating insanity, beating back the nightmares with bullets and urine. Strafe, dash, slide, and bunny hop through massive retro-styled stages, including a grungy asylum, comic convention, Area 69, and more. Each of The POSTAL Dude’s twisted fantasies offers new challenges and a characteristic flow — from corridor shooting through secret passages to blowing up large, open spaces with perfect twitch reflexes — but the hardcore spirit of badass ‘90s shooters bleeds from every orifice. With a heaping arsenal of nostalgic, bombastic weaponry, POSTAL: Brain Damaged delivers a pure boomer shooter experience. Eviscerate enemies with the double-barreled shotgun, remove flat-earther heads from afar with the devastating railgun, and attach the cat silencer to blast aliens and military zombies with feline style. POSTAL: Brain Damaged boasts the series’ beloved over-the-top parody and satire of pop culture, politics, and modern society. Escape from reality and unwind while beating back hippies, fleeing from flying fluids, and wiping out enemies to your heart’s content while pixelated blood spurts forth and a thrashing old school soundtrack thumps with every gun blast. “They just don’t make badass shooters like they used to,” said Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors. ""Brain Damaged takes the torch from all the pretenders while excreting everything fans want to see from the series that once birthed “The Worst Game Ever™”. The Dude is back and dirtier than ever!” POSTAL: Brain Damaged launches for PC and consoles in 2021.

232770,"A Merry Christmas, to all our fans!","https://i.imgur.com/TeKAIQ4g.png Ah, Christmas… I hope you will excuse the rushed nature of this little holiday message, as I am currently at a bus station, waiting for a bus to visit my relatives. I could have just wrote “Merry Christmas, everyone!” and left it at that, but I had some more sincere thoughts on the mind that I wanted to share. It would be easy to just wish everyone a merry Christmas, and to say that we hope your holidays are filled with nothing but joy and love, but we know it doesn’t always work out that way. While some are finding it easy to cozy up with loved ones, with a big merry feast, others are alone and dealing with hardships. Christmas itself doesn’t magically make everything better for everyone, everywhere. A lot of us still end up having to deal with unfortunate circumstances. Maybe you find yourself alone this year. Maybe you are forced to work, or otherwise spend the evening away from your loved ones. Maybe some recent tragedy has left a painful scar. We know all too well how rough life can treat you, when you're supposed to be given some reprieve, at least once a year. But ultimately we cannot expect circumstances to carve our happiness for us, can we? Happiness is not something that just happens; it is hard-fought and earned through striving for it, in spite all the gut-punches that life and circumstance may throw our way. It is self-made, through a stubborn desire to not allow things beyond our control to dictate how we should feel and how we should spend our days. We are the masters of our own fate, and we make our own joy when there is none to be found. That is the resilience of the human spirit. So from the bottom of our hearts, to all our fans, friends, family and loved ones, to all the freaks, NEETs, creeps, loners and weirdos out there, we wish a very Merry Christmas and we sincerely hope that all of you manage to find the will and stubbornness to find some joy and happiness tonight!",1545697257,

232770,THE ORIGINAL POSTAL HAS BEEN MADE OPEN SOURCE,"It was in September, 1997 – over 19 years ago (we’ll round that out to 20, for marketing reasons) – when us humble folk from Running With Scissors unleashed our Robotron-inspired isometric shooter POSTAL to the unsuspecting public at large. It was an instant hit, grabbing the attention of gamers, parents and politicians across the country, and we’ve been supporting and updating it ever since. But now, (almost) 20 years later, we are entrusting our fans with the future of our game, by releasing its source code to the public. Consider it a belated Christmas present! It’s hard to digest how long ago POSTAL was released. Feels like it was only yesterday that our new fans were sending us wonderful e-mail to praise our work, and we received our very first lawsuit notice… ah, those were the days. But it’s true – (nearly) 20 years have passed us by. So much has happened in that time, that it’s hard to even keep track of it all – an entire generation has grown into legal adults, while video games have evolved to levels of near-photorealism; plus we’re finally getting that VR tech that we’ve been dreaming of since before we released POSTAL. It’s been a long and eventful couple of decades, full of change and advancement, but there is one thing that has always remained constant – our continued support and updates for our baby. Thanks to the dedicated hard-workers in our team, the loving support of our fans and even the efforts by our detractors, POSTAL has seen a lot of activity during these many years – an expansion pack, a lawsuit by the Postal Service, an exclusive Japanese edition, bans in 14 countries across the world, re-released special editions, sequels, digital re-releases, an Android port, new updates with twin-stick controls, a novelization and even an enhanced modern remake. Not too shabby for one of “the three worst things in American society”, wouldn’t you agree? The remake – POSTAL Redux – was an especially big step for us; a passion project to make the original POSTAL again, but do it better this time, rebuilding it from scratch and focusing on making the most fun and exhilarating twin-stick shooter that we could by patching up the unfortunately outdated design decisions, and improve the game where we could. We even used the opportunity to bring old content, which was exclusive to the Japanese release of the game, to the west for the first time! For anyone who really wants to see how far POSTAL has come in the last two decades, there is no better way than by comparing the original to Redux. It’s definitely been a wild ride for us all, and POSTAL means a lot to us – it’s our baby… But now we’re ready to hand the future of ‘the little shooter that could’ to the public at large. People have been asking, and we have been promising this for years now, but today we are proud to announce that the source code for POSTAL is officially released to the public on Bitbucket, under the GPL2 license. Everyone now has ‘under the hood’ access, to see what makes POSTAL tick, and anyone with the time and skills can now tweak/change/update/modify anything in the game at all!

232770,THE ORIGINAL POSTAL HAS BEEN MADE OPEN SOURCE,"It was in September, 1997 – over 19 years ago (we’ll round that out to 20, for marketing reasons) – when us humble folk from Running With Scissors unleashed our Robotron-inspired isometric shooter POSTAL to the unsuspecting public at large. It was an instant hit, grabbing the attention of gamers, parents and politicians across the country, and we’ve been supporting and updating it ever since. But now, (almost) 20 years later, we are entrusting our fans with the future of our game, by releasing its source code to the public. Consider it a belated Christmas present! It’s hard to digest how long ago POSTAL was released. Feels like it was only yesterday that our new fans were sending us wonderful e-mail to praise our work, and we received our very first lawsuit notice… ah, those were the days. But it’s true – (nearly) 20 years have passed us by. So much has happened in that time, that it’s hard to even keep track of it all – an entire generation has grown into legal adults, while video games have evolved to levels of near-photorealism; plus we’re finally getting that VR tech that we’ve been dreaming of since before we released POSTAL. It’s been a long and eventful couple of decades, full of change and advancement, but there is one thing that has always remained constant – our continued support and updates for our baby. Thanks to the dedicated hard-workers in our team, the loving support of our fans and even the efforts by our detractors, POSTAL has seen a lot of activity during these many years – an expansion pack, a lawsuit by the Postal Service, an exclusive Japanese edition, bans in 14 countries across the world, re-released special editions, sequels, digital re-releases, an Android port, new updates with twin-stick controls, a novelization and even an enhanced modern remake. Not too shabby for one of “the three worst things in American society”, wouldn’t you agree? The remake – POSTAL Redux – was an especially big step for us; a passion project to make the original POSTAL again, but do it better this time, rebuilding it from scratch and focusing on making the most fun and exhilarating twin-stick shooter that we could by patching up the unfortunately outdated design decisions, and improve the game where we could. We even used the opportunity to bring old content, which was exclusive to the Japanese release of the game, to the west for the first time! For anyone who really wants to see how far POSTAL has come in the last two decades, there is no better way than by comparing the original to Redux. It’s definitely been a wild ride for us all, and POSTAL means a lot to us – it’s our baby… But now we’re ready to hand the future of ‘the little shooter that could’ to the public at large. People have been asking, and we have been promising this for years now, but today we are proud to announce that the source code for POSTAL is officially released to the public on Bitbucket, under the GPL2 license. Everyone now has ‘under the hood’ access, to see what makes POSTAL tick, and anyone with the time and skills can now tweak/change/update/modify anything in the game at all! And hey, if anyone feels the urge to port the game to other platforms (The Dreamcast, for example *wink* *wink*), then they absolutely can! This has been a long time coming, and we are tickled pink to see what the community will be able to put together from this (no seriously, someone get on that Dreamcast port. We’re not joking.).

232770,Postal director Uwe Boll is quitting the movie biz,"Uwe Boll's 2013 <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/123-people-have-pledged-real-money-so-that-uwe-boll-can-make-a-postal-2-movie/"">Postal 2 Kickstarter</a> ended much like his movies, which is to say, badly and without any money. And now it seems that his career has wound up in basically the same way. The director of infamously awful videogame-based movies like Alone in the Dark, Bloodrayne, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, and Far Cry, has announced his retirement from the business, telling <a href=""http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2016/10/20/director-uwe-boll-rampage-of-terrible-films-is-finished.html"">Metro</a> that his reason for getting out of the game is simple: There's no money to be made. ""With streaming everywhere there is just a big wave of movies flooding around and you have no impact, Boll said. The market is dead. You don t make any money anymore on movies because the DVD and Blu Ray market worldwide has dropped 80 per cent in the last three years. That is the real reason; I just cannot afford to make movies. Boll said his films have been self-financed since 2005, the same year he released Alone in the Dark and the first Bloodrayne film. He's actually directed, and produced, a number of non-game-based movies since then, but this will come as a shock, I'm sure neither they nor his game-based projects have made any money. Not because they were bad movies, according to Boll, but simply because they didn't feature any Hollywood heavyweights. "" is way better than Wall Street 2 by Oliver Stone, he said. It s better researched, it s better written, it s better, but it doesn t have Michael Douglas. In an ironic twist, he seems to blame the end of his filmmaking career on his choice of subject matter in the early days, specifically the ones that made him so well-known among gamers. ""If I hadn t made the stupid videogame-based movies I would never have amalgamated the capital so I could say, Let s make the Darfur movie',"" he said. ""I don t need a Ferrari, I don t need a yacht. I invested in my own movies and I lost money. Based on his <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0093051/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"">IMDB entry</a>, Boll's last game-based flick was the 2014 release In the Name of the King: The Last Job, although that stretches the Dungeon Siege connection pretty thin; the last to bear an actual game name would be Bloodrayne: The Third Reich, which came out in 2011. His final film, if he sticks to his retirement guns, will be Rampage: President Down, which looks to be a vaguely Postal-like tale about an angry man who shoots the President and then a whole bunch of other guys.

232770,Postal Redux gets spring release and system requirements,"Believe it or not, it's been almost 20 years since the isometric third-person shooter Postal inflicted itself upon the world.&nbsp;It wasn't particularly good, by most&nbsp;accounts, but earned considerable notoriety for its wanton, over-the-top, and entirely gratuitous violence. It inevitably&nbsp;spawned a couple of sequels (that were <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/postal-3-review/"">even worse</a>) and&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486640/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"">Uwe Boll film</a>. In&nbsp;2014 developer Running With Scissors announced that it had begun work on an HD remake entitled <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/postal-redux-confirmed-for-next-year/"">Postal Redux</a>. Today the studio announced that Postal Redux, which it describes as a psychological thriller with a grim art style and frightening ambiance, will be out this spring. It will add new content to the original, including a Carnival level, and a new score-based Rampage Mode, which encourages an aggressive style of play by increasing a multiplier for each consecutive kill in a streak. At the end of each level, players will be graded based on the level of mayhem they unleash upon the world. The minimum system requirements have also been posted <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/401680/"">on Steam</a>. They're subject to change, but for now are pleasingly low. * <strong>OS</strong>: Windows Vista, 7, 8 and 10; * <strong>Processor</strong>: Dual core processor; * <strong>Graphics</strong>: DirectX10 compatible graphics card w/ dedicated 1GB RAM; * <strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 10; * <strong>Storage</strong>: 5 GB available space ""Even with all the noise surrounding Postal, gamers focused on the experience, playing the game by the millions, giving it great user reviews and helping us not only survive, but flourish, Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi said. Postal Redux is a love letter to our fans. The original Postal remains available on <a href=""http://www.gog.com/game/postal_classic_and_uncut"">GOG</a>, if you dare to compare.

232770,POSTAL 1 goes on sale and receives major controller improvements!,"Salutations, fine members of the POSTAL community. We come to you today with some exciting news for POSTAL 1! Not only is the title on a 90% off sale for the next week, it has also received a big update with several major improvements. POSTAL 1 is, of course, the quaint little isometric third person shooter that launched a series and played an important role in gaming history. However, when viewed today in contemporary eyes, it’s often seen as having one glaring problem: the clunky tank control scheme. This control setup has not aged gracefully over time, and we’ve heard the many requests from fans to introduce more modern twin stick type controls. We were able to implement these when we released the game on Android via the Amazon Appstore, and today, we are happy to announce we have back ported these improved controls to the Windows and Linux versions! We have also added the following improvements: The Special Delivery expansion levels are now relegated to a separate campaign option in the menu due to popular demand. The HUD status bar now displays the required percentage of hostiles to eliminate at all times for convenience The crosshair is now a floating crosshair instead of the old ineffectual lock-on crosshair and is enabled by default. Proper widescreen aspect ratio and monitor support If your potato was unable to run Hatred, you can now check out the game that inspired its creation while still enjoying the benefits of modern twin stick controls! Sorry, Mac men and women, we were unable to get these updates ready for you. Fear not, though, as you’ll be receiving the massive and long-awaited POSTAL 2 collective update in the very near future! And as long as you’re dropping money on sale items, be sure to check out the excellent first person adventure game Ether One by our buddies at White Paper Games, on sale now at 75% off! http://store.steampowered.com/app/265950/ Oh, and don’t think we’ve forgotten!

232770,Postal: Redux confirmed for next year,"<a href=""/postal-redux-confirmed-for-next-year/""> </a> Postal is one of the most famously controversial video game series ever made. It's also not very good, and has actually been in decline since the original was released in 1997: Postal has a <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/search/all/postal/results"">Metacritic</a> score of 59, Postal 2 is a flat 50, and Postal 3 is a dismal 24. (We gave it 21 in our <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/postal-3-review/"">review</a>.) But developer Running With Scissors isn't giving up&mdash;in fact, it's going back to its roots. The developer confirmed Postal: Redux on <a href=""https://twitter.com/RWSPOSTAL/status/533375026834456577"">Twitter</a> last week, writing that it will be ""Faithful to the original with redrawn HD art &amp; redone character models,"" and have ""many new features such as co-op."" It's being developed for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and is expected to be ready sometime in 2015. To clarify for those who missed this section of game history, Postal 2 and 3 are both shooters&mdash;first and third-person, respectively&mdash;but the original Postal is an isometric action game. That's the one that's being remade, although RWS hinted that the others could be overhauled as well, tweeting, ""We're going back to our darker roots with this for now."" Just to be clear, it's a remake of POSTAL 1, not POSTAL 2. We're going back to our darker roots with this for now. &mdash; RunningWithScissors (@RWSPOSTAL) <a href=""https://twitter.com/RWSPOSTAL/status/533375951468785664"">November 14, 2014</a> The original Postal is actually still available on <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/232770/"">Steam</a>, and it's&nbsp;on sale right now for 75 cents.
