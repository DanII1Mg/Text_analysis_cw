899770,Looking Ahead in Last Epoch,"Good day, Travelers! Today we’re sharing a deeper look at what’s coming in Season 4, Season 5, and the Last Epoch: Orobyss expansion. Inside this update, you’ll find our revised roadmap, a new teaser, the launch date for Season 4, and the first details about its upcoming content. We’re also pulling back the curtain on some of what you can expect in Season 5 and offering an early glimpse at the journey ahead in Last Epoch: Orobyss. We want to touch on our information release cadence and quantity for a moment. There’s a delicate balance between keeping the community informed and keeping information hidden to build hype before a big update. We recognize that we’ve missed the mark in recent posts. So we’re revealing much more than we usually would at this stage, but we still have plenty of details and exciting content to share on the lead-up to Season 4’s launch. Updated Roadmap Before we get into the details of Season 4, let’s take a look at the updated Season 4 & Beyond Roadmap that includes many of our current plans for Seasons 4, 5, and the Last Epoch: Orobyss expansion. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/c/a/ca8f71db20be058ada969eeea5d6347ae4d3200e.jpeg Teaser Trailer and Release Date We are thrilled to share with you that Season 4: Shattered Omens will be coming to you on March 26, 2026! Season 4 Feature Overview Season 4 is aimed to be a well-rounded patch, bringing a new seasonal mechanic, itemization, improvements to existing systems, some class updates, quality-of-life improvements, new uniques, set items, and more. Let’s talk about the new seasonal mechanic, Omen Windows. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/e/4/e499f676357728813941628270d8f36188b65442.jpeg Omen Windows In Season 4, Travelers will encounter tears in reality known as Omen Windows. These fractures reflect the moment the Observer fell into despair and pulled fate itself into darkness. Omen Windows appear as a new type of random encounter throughout both the campaign and the endgame. When you discover an Omen Window and step into its area, the window shatters into a fragmented ring and draws out an Omen, an entity created from pure Void and the Observer’s madness. This begins a relentless assault of Fractured enemies emerging from the shards. Defeating enemies inside the ring expands the area and progresses the encounter. In the first phase of the encounter, the Omen cannot be damaged or debuffed. It stays elusive while tethering to and empowering elite Fractured enemies. After enough waves are defeated, the Omen destroys any remaining enemies, absorbs their strength, and then engages the player directly. Omen Windows scale in difficulty as you move through the campaign and continue into the Monolith with higher levels of corruption. Higher tiers reward players with increased item quantity and improved item quality upon completion. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/4/c/4c7d871912867a7e607d5d50276687af88bff7fa.gif Omen Window Rewards Omen Window encounters offer a trove of valuable rewards, including Runes of Corruption and Timeglass Fragments, which we will talk more about below. In addition to these, you will earn Corrupted Altars and Omen Idols, which we will reveal more details about closer to the launch of Season 4. Corrupted Items & Rune of Corruption As players slay Omens, they may drop Runes of Corruption. This new rune can be used to corrupt an item, modifying it unpredictably. The resulting item may emerge vastly improved with new modifiers and effects that can only be obtained by Corruption, or the item may be downgraded or completely ruined. Will you take the risk of corrupting one of your best items? As we get closer to Season 4’s release, we’ll explore in more detail the myriad of outcomes and power that can be gained by accepting the risk of corrupting your items. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/4/1/4147729c5c407d7bc032c5ad8c9f2a5e470bc9da.jpeg Timeglass Fragments Timeglass Fragments are a new multi-use currency that can be used to trade for specific items, including Runes of Corruption and new Woven Echoes. Additionally, Timeglass fragments may be used during endgame, where a more challenging variant of the Omen Window encounter, called a Greater Window, may appear as an Echo objective. Completing this encounter reforms the Omen Window into a Timeglass Core, which allows you to spend Timeglass Fragments to modify your Echo web and add Echo Chains. Echo Chains Echo Chains are a group of sequential Echoes that reveal all of their links as soon as they appear in the Monolith’s Echo Web. Several types of Echo Chains revolve around specific mechanics, allowing you to continue engaging with those mechanics over multiple echoes. You’ll then finish the chain with a related, more rewarding Echo, such as a Conquered Tower (The one where you fight multiple Nemeses). Each link in the chain provides a quick portal to the next Echo, removing the need t...",1765238018,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_871423085_1765238922_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"
899770,Eterra Monthly: Nov. Edition 2025,"The sun is soon to set on another year, and the night grows ever longer. As we light the fires to guide us through the end of the year, our sense of community and camaraderie is renewed; rediscovered. Another month has passed, another day has ended, but time moves on. Let’s take a look at what we have to share in this month’s edition of Eterra Monthly! Eyes on Eterra Recent discussions have sparked concerns about us moving towards AI-First. We want to be clear: Eleventh Hour Games is committed to people-first development. We’re continuing to invest in talented developers across multiple disciplines because our studio’s strength has always come from passionate, creative individuals. If you’re excited about game development and believe your skills could help shape the future of Last Epoch, we encourage you to apply. EHG was built by dedicated gamers, and we’re committed to ensuring that human passion and craftsmanship remain at the core of creating the greatest ARPG. Our CEO and Game Director, Judd Cobler, also shared some exciting news for players who purchased Last Epoch. The upcoming Orobyss expansion will be FREE to all owners of the base game. In addition to the free expansion, players on both platforms will be presented with a brand new DLC class that can be optionally purchased. This class is NOT required in order to enjoy the Orobyss expansion. While the details of this class are under lock and key for the time being, we have revealed that this will be the first of what is being called “Paradox Classes.” One question we’ve seen quite a bit is why the class is paid, not the expansion, when doing so is a “common and accepted” model. We needed to adjust our monetisation model, as cosmetic sales alone were not enough to fund development costs. We've been strongly against paid expansions because of how they split the player base; so by making the class paid, the monetisation remains optional, and the player base can stay as one. A road map has also been provided in addition to all of the above. We encourage you all to take a look and see with your own eyes, here. Mike's Teasers The Dev stream was light on teasers. Turns out a little tar and cloth can work wonders to plug a leak. All the same, it didn’t stop this ghostly visage from finding its way to Mike’s stream. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/3/6/36f84c47efe27f63f1a0d85c69fac4444bd600b7.png Build Spotlight https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/0/c/0ccf581da15a89853417a3c28fa8068d4224c159_2_812x456.jpeg As the world turns and the north grows cold and dark, we travel back in time to a place of bitter wind, blood, and savagery. There is strength in numbers to be sure, but every pack needs a leader. The Triple Team Beastmaster is all of that and more! This month’s Build Spotlight goes to the Triple Team Beastmaster by Lelith. The most important item to begin this build with is the Tyrant’s Skull. We’ve been seeing this relic a lot this season, and for good reason. Lelith uses Last Bear’s Lament, and Last Bear's Fury, both reforged, to round out Heath, Endurance, and Damage output. Mantle of the Pale Ox for body armor, and Cleaver Solution and Naal’s Tooth for weapons, pretty much complete this behemoth of a fighter. You’ll want Swipe, Fury Leap, and Frenzy totems for yourself, but other than that, let your ferocious and sometimes furry friends handle the rest. Read the full build guide for all the juicy details, then go terrorise the wild unknown of the Monolith of Fate. Community Fun As the end of the year rests right around the corner, families and friends will gather. This month, we’d like to offer you all something warm and comforting to gather around. Wick stumbled his way through a portal and into Eterra again. It took a while to get back, but when he did, he had quite the story to tell. “I found myself far in the north. Not quite to Heoborea proper, but close enough to smell the cook fires another day’s walk away. As it grew darker, I found a lone campfire, tended by a figure in black. He gave me a place to sit and a warm drink that felt like home. He never gave his name, but when I asked where he’d learned to make a cider like this, all filled with sweet and spice, he said, ‘One of the oldest traditions in the dark months is to sit around the fire with friends, tell your story, and enjoy a steaming mug of Wassail. Oh, how I miss those days when things were simpler, the world was quieter, and friends were easier to find.’ He didn’t sound sad, just distant, as if his memories had carried him somewhere far away. I knew what was coming. The terror from the eastern mountains and the armies at his command. But for now, I enjoyed a piece of fire, and something to remind me of my own friends.” Notes: - The type of apple and orange doesn’t matter. They are more of a preference. However, if you have some wassail left over, store it in the refrigerator with the spices and fruit inside. The fruit will continue to soft...",1764608460,

899770,"Last Epoch’s Season 4 and Beyond: Expansion, Paradox Classes, and Roadmap","Travelers, today we’re releasing our updated roadmap leading to the launch of Last Epoch: Orobyss, and along with answers to several of the biggest questions the community has been asking.The one we’ve heard the most is simple: “Will the Last Epoch: Orobyss expansion be free for existing players?” The answer is Yes. Anyone on PC who owns Last Epoch before the launch of the Orobyss expansion will receive the expansion as a free update. New players and PlayStation 5 players will be purchasing Last Epoch, all of its seasonal content, and the Orobyss expansion as one updated purchase.Alongside the free expansion content, I’m excited to announce that we’re introducing something genuinely new to Last Epoch, a fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game. We’re calling this new category Paradox Classes, and the first one will debut alongside the upcoming expansion as paid DLC for players who want to explore new playstyles. These classes will let us experiment in new and innovative ways, and we’ll have plenty to share as we get closer to release.We’re committed to supporting Last Epoch for years with new stories, systems, itemization updates, ways to play, onboarding improvements, seasonal mechanics, and more. There’s never been a better time to step into the world of Eterra.Before the expansion arrives, we have two more seasons planned. Season 4 is slated for early 2026 and will introduce a new seasonal mechanic along with several highly requested updates. We’ll start sharing teasers and a firm release date soon - keep an eye on our streams and social channels.We’ll also have more to reveal about Season 5 as we move later into 2026. Together, these two seasons lead directly into the launch of Last Epoch: Orobyss, as outlined in the roadmap below:While we want to shorten the time between seasonal releases, it matters more that each season is strong enough to be worthy of inviting our players back to play. Right now, we are upgrading internal tools, hiring and onboarding many new team members, and preparing the game for PlayStation 5 while building this seasonal content. Trying to speed up during this period would only sacrifice quality. We will work toward faster seasonal releases when the studio can support it in a healthy way as the team grows.Also, there has been a lot of discussion around Krafton’s recent comments about being “AI-first” and what that might mean for EHG. To be clear, our development approach is not changing. We remain focused on building Last Epoch the same way we always have, with the same hands-on design philosophy. To support this, we are hiring across several disciplines. If you have experience that fits and a real understanding of the ARPG genre, we encourage you to apply here.The team is focused on upcoming seasons, the expansion, and getting Last Epoch ready for multiple platforms as we continue to grow and upgrade our studio. We appreciate your support and look forward to bringing you more great Last Epoch content soon.Judd Cobler Game Director, Last Epoch",1764094020,

But October saw some old faces return to the world of Last Epoch. Get ready as some new initiatives are taking the lead for some old friends (and foes) to light the way toward a bright future. Patch Review The team has been focused on Season 4 and beyond, so they delivered one patch in October to resolve an engine vulnerability in Unity.. Patch 1.3.6 - Patched Unity Engine vulnerability - This engine upgrade is for Unity Security, and we do not expect any noticeable differences with this engine upgrade. Please continue to use the in-game bug reporter if you happen to encounter any bugs or issues. Eyes on Eterra The EHG team has been doing its best to “exterminate the nest” of bugs. Sometimes it’s a simple task, and that’s why you see so many patches and hotfixes at the beginning of a season. But there are still more running around impacting your gaming experience, and we're asking for your help. We’ve opened up this forum post where you can record your own long-standing bug problems. The Community team will be your voice and put these in front of developers to prioritize. With that in mind, we have a forum post here where you can record your own long-standing bug problems. We’ve also seen a few people who do not want to create a forum account just to report a bug. We get it and completely understand. But please know that having your responses in one place, instead of having to hunt for them elsewhere, will make solving these issues exponentially easier. In an effort to help us locate any new bugs, we’d like everyone to be aware of some new information on our Support site. You can find a handy How-To guide on submitting bug reports right here. It’s important that bug reports are as detailed as possible to help the team track them down and find their cause, so please give it a read so we can work together to squash them quickly. Mike's Teasers The month of October was a bit lighter on teasers, but what we did see sparked lots of discussions amongst Travelers. First on the teaser list were two skill cards for Fire Aura. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/d/0/d0963ccc2c75298f814156c57f19851dadcac30f.png https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/c/6/c66f0faa467a4f554b6c000c61622cf0bb0792dd.png Mike gave us a “cryptic” teaser, which sparked a ton of theories. Feel free to hop down the rabbit hole. We might see you on the other side. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/7/9/79bf0af8ffe8c6a89b2246861c14fcab6b35823b.png Build Spotlight https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/f/ff4c90866cf9ca06f4a11556cd06d4627b9f8c34_2_812x456.jpeg You can fire your gardener; he’s not cutting it anymore. It’s time to mow the yard, and Eterra is looking a little overgrown with enemies. This month’s Build Spotlight goes to Wiz52 and their Holy Lawnmower. A Melee Tank Paladin build focusing on Rive, Healing Hands, Smite, Sigils of Hop, and Holy Aura. Rive is the star of the show with this dual-wielding build that can push 1000 Corruption and more. That means your white Nikes won’t be stained with void ooze anytime soon. Check out the Official Build Guide to see exactly how it works, but here are a few things to get you started. According to Wiz52, “The core of build is to use Rive in order to proc Healing Hands, which is going to be our main source of damage and ward generation.” That means you only need to focus on one skill. A nice passive change of pace compared to some of the more involved builds we’ve showcased. Using Palarus’s Sacred Light will auto-cast Smite 3 times per second while also buffing fire damage and attack speed. We already mentioned you’ll want Palarus’s Sacred Light, but you’ll also want Eye of Reen for increased damage output thanks to stacks of Reen’s Ire. Orian’s Sun Seal seems to be the only other must-have for this build, which means there is room for you to lean into a few other items you really love. So, give this a try and get to mowing down mobs. Community Fun Halloween has come and gone but Autumn is still in full swing. Let’s see what’s cooking in the community kitchen! This Fall season, we are making Sweet Burning Amber. A delicious candied Pumpkin recipe that is sure to be a hit around the house, or at your next party.

We're still a little over a month out from Diablo 4 Season 10, but Path of Exile 2's next update is coming in just a few weeks. For now, however, my attention is squarely turned towards the new Last Epoch update, 'Beneath Ancient Skies.' It'll take us on a 'Primal Hunt' to face down some of the toughest beasts ever seen in Eterra, along with the addition of the tenth chapter of the campaign, and some dramatic reworks for the Acolyte class and its Lich and Necromancer masteries. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/last-epoch/season-3-preview-primal-hunt"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/last-epoch/loot-filter-sound"">Great news, Diablo 4 rival Last Epoch is finally adding loot filter sounds</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/last-epoch/season-3-lich-necromancer-rework"">Last Epoch Season 3 reworks Necromancer and Lich as the ARPG's new era begins</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/last-epoch/dev-joins-krafton"">Last Epoch dev prepares to scale up as the excellent ARPG gets a new publisher</a> ",1755197105,
899770,Quality of Life & Minion AI | Coming to Last Epoch August 21st,"Greetings Travelers!We hope you've enjoyed Pre-Patch Hype Week so far. Today's focus includes a glimpse at what Beneath Ancient Skies will bring in terms of Quality of Life features and more on August 21st. If you recall our Season 3 trailer, you may have learned that the team has reworked some of the existing minions for Necromancer and Beastmaster. While we won't spoil everything here, we will give you a peek at what to expect with some of your favorite Beastmaster minions, along with their rework and AI improvements. If you are looking for Necromancer skills, be sure to visit yesterday’s post regarding Lich & Necromancer rework. Without Further ado, let’s begin! Minion ChangesMinion AIWho doesn’t love minions?! In Season 3, we’ll have some neat Minion behavior adjustments. The goal behind these minion changes is to make the Minion AI smarter with less management. Toggle between two different minion behavior modes. By default, Minions have always been in a Protect mode, which made them prioritize staying quite near the player. This often caused annoyance when you wanted your minions to have a longer leash and target enemies instead. With Season 3, you'll now be able to toggle between the old protect mode and the new Assassinate mode with the press of a single key. The Assassinate mode will make your minions target enemies from further away, focusing on bosses and rare enemies. The current mode of your minions will be indicated by the icon beside the minions’ portrait. Assassinate Mode & Protect Mode Minion target prioritization is also more sticky, meaning that your minions now have a higher priority to continue attacking a target they're already attacking, and are less likely to bounce between targets. Again, this change is especially prominent in Assassinate mode or if the target is a boss or a rare enemy. The purpose of these changes is to allow more variety in your minion playstyle while leaving control in your commanding hands. Minion ImprovementsThe team has resolved the majority of common snapshotting issues, and we’ll continue addressing others whenever they appear. Minions should now correctly update their stats whenever nodes or equipment are swapped out, even if the minions were previously already summoned. Additionally, you now gain 0.8% minion power per character level (from 0.6%). This means that at level 100, your minions deal 60% more damage and take 60% less damage (from 45% for both). Further, the 50% less damage from dangerous enemy abilities has been increased to be 60% less damage instead. Beastmaster MinionsIf you take delight in summoning as a Beastmaster, we’ll have something here for you! Multiple Beastmaster minions will be getting updates in Season 3. Again, while we won't go over each change, we'd love to give you a bite-sized preview. Staying in theme with the additional Ancient Era content with Beneath Ancient Skies, the Raptor tree will see a few changes. One of the changes we wanted to highlight today was the Raptor's new Volcanic Adaptation node. With this node, your Raptor becomes a Dragon Raptor. Not only does this sound cool, but this also allows your Raptor to deal fire damage alongside its new ability, Fire Breath. You can expect other fun nodes to follow this new conversion node—a perfect example of Evolution, at its finest. Along with these changes, the Scorpion will now have the ability to cast Maelstrom alongside you with its new Frozen Winds node! In a Similar fashion, your Bear will also have a new node that will allow it to use Earthquake. While the scaling will be based on your Bear’s stats and not yours, the Bear will be able to benefit from how you have specialized Earthquake! The new minion changes are going to give Beastmaster more options for their companions and expand their build options and potential. Note: this node has since been adjusted to -50% Bear Earthquake Damage during balance passesMerchant’s GuildAnother feature we are excited to share coming in Season 3 includes updates for the Merchant’s Guild. Now, whenever you filter by 1 specific unique, a new filter will appear to select min or max roll ranges for any of the modifiers on that unique. Additionally, we've added the ability to set filters from an item for easier price checking. Who doesn't enjoy easy shopping?We are also adding new Tokens to allow purchasing items without paying favor or before you've unlocked the necessary rank to help improve the Merchant’s Guild's early game experience. This comes in the form of a Merchant's Token or a Black Market Token. Merchant’s Token bypasses the favor cost when purchasing an item, while Black Market Token on top of bypassing the favor cost, also allows you to purchase items that would normally require a higher rank and sets the rank requirement to equip the item to be 1. You’ll get a Merchant’s Token at every rank up with the Faction, and one Black Market Token once you reach rank 6. They can also be found like normal items when slaying enemies, ...",1755187252,
899770,Lich & Necromancer Updates | Coming to Last Epoch August 21st,"Welcome to the Season 3 Hype Week Day 3! For all of you Acolyte fiends, this one is for you. So grab a femur or two and follow us into the darkness as we get into the new Lich and Necromancer changes coming August 21st. New Lich Skill - Flay In Season 3, Lich gets a new skill to take to the field with Flay. Flay is a new Melee and Spell attack skill hybrid that is specific to the Lich Mastery, and becomes unlocked at 30 points invested in the Lich passive tree. When you use the Flay Skill, you will first Spirit Step a short distance towards an enemy if you aren’t within range, and then perform a narrow, rending slash. Each enemy killed by the Melee Attack will release a Blood Eruption, a Spell dealing Physical damage in an area. Enemies can be hit by both Flay and all Blood Eruptions that occur. With built-in movement to close the gap on your foes with no cooldown, you may find yourself stepping through the shadows, rapidly eliminating foes like flickers of light in the night. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/c/ace157923ef9dd9df62c435e5ca0b03129c00503.gif https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/f/4/f475314f11c8bb673aa8fa8cccd7e60fbfa4390f.png Flay Skill Tree Nodes Flay’s core functionality allows for a number of playstyles already, with movement, melee, and spell components. The tree also allows for specialization into the initial Melee Attack, the Blood Eruption, or both for a truly hybrid build. Lets take a look at some of the options you’ll be able to find in Flay’s skill tree to customize it to your style. Deadly Plot Everyone likes scaling methods, and with Deadly Plot you’ll obtain the ability to scale Flay with your mana pool. For a small additional mana cost, Flay and all skills triggered by its skill tree deal 5% more Spell damage per point per 100 maximum Mana. This includes skills which have their own skill tree, such as Rip Blood, and Chaos Bolts so long as they are triggered by Flay’s Tree. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/c/8c3e58f9f5f71b5b034ed91cfbb6799fbd07c7ab.png Transference When hitting a boss or rare enemy with Flay’s melee attack, your active Aura of Decay can be transferred to be centered instead on that enemy for 6 seconds. While the Aura is attached to the enemy, the Lich can move away from the area and no longer be harmed by the self-inflicted ailments from Aura of Decay! https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/5/8594a5e04567459175e6ed270aeb208b30f924d2.png Damage Conversions Damage Types are a critical part of any skill, allowing synergy with like-typed skills. Flay by default is a Physical skill, though it offers the ability to convert damage types, allowing synergy with more skills, items, and passives depending on how you want to play it. Corrupted Blood With corrupted Blood, all Bleed chance from all sources is converted to poison. Poison doesn’t have a hit component, so you will still be “hitting” with physical damage, while stacking deadly poisons on the enemy. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/4/2/422ee16b4b7afb0af5e0f60e0780473dbbe9b196.png https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/3/1/3155b4bedc7195525fe0b7aeeb18b2b26587231b.gif Frostblight Lich is also getting more access to cold damage, with Frostblight converting Flay’s base damage to cold, and Bleed chance from all sources to Frostbite. The cold touch of death indeed. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/2/e/2e7fdaa5958611a9dd517d2b50b219326ac58468.png https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/f/e/fe263f515edc647b828d2acf86b394e0c461073f.gif Soul Ripper In the mood for flesh-melting?

Many of you know that Heavy has been a big part of our community since our early days, contributing to the Beesfriends Community Guides program, the Community Tester program, as well as being highly active in the community helping fellow players. Executioner’s Tithe was created as part of our old “Design a Unique” Supporter packs that were available in our early days. While we aren’t currently offering this tier of supporter pack, we love seeing the community’s unique ideas, and working with the community to bring new and exciting playstyles to Last Epoch.

899770,The Ancient Era | Coming to Last Epoch August 21st,"Greetings Travelers! Welcome to Day #2 of Hype Week!

899770,Primal Hunt | Coming to Last Epoch August 21st,"Hello Travelers, and welcome to day one of our Hype Week Posts for Season 3: Beneath Ancient Skies! For those joining us for the first time for a new Season, Hype week is a week-long series of blog posts covering some of the biggest features to look forward to in the coming Season. That means over the next 5 days, you will get your first look at the new Ancient Era zones, the new Lich skill: Flay, Updates to Necromancer, Minion AI, QoL features, and more! The hype week culminates in the Patch notes, coming this Friday, August 15th. The team has been hard at work, and it’s finally time to reveal it to you. Before eventually getting to the full nitty-gritty with the patch notes, let’s start with taking a look at the new gameplay system coming with Season 3: The Primal Hunt. Primal Hunt Primal Hunt is a new random encounter similar to the Nemesis mechanic, being introduced to Last Epoch on August 21st. You will be able to encounter the Primal Hunt during normal gameplay in both Campaign and in the Monolith of Fate. But what are we hunting, and what trophies are we seeking? The Primal Hunt introduces a new way for players to discover powerful new items for their characters to equip in the form of Primal Uniques and tier 8 affixes that transform any item into a Primordial Exalted. These items are some of the most powerful and exciting ever introduced in Last Epoch! Let’s take get into how you will go about interacting with this new system. As one might expect with a name such as The Primal Hunt, everything starts with tracking your prey. Along your journey, you will encounter a Mysterious rift that one of the Rift Beasts has left open to their breeding grounds. Upon traveling through this rift, you will find yourself at the entrance of an ancient cave, meeting with Skarven Bloodhorn, the Wengari Hunt Master to begin tracking your quarry. The beast you’re tracking is not the only one to be found in these caverns though, so do be prepared for a fight. Enemies within this cave system will drop Ancient Bones instead of gold (how do normal dinosaurs get it in their pockets?), which you will eventually use to acquire Primordial Items. We’ll talk about Primordial Materials in just a bit here. The Rift Beast Making your way through these ancient caves, you will eventually find a nest belonging to the Rift Beast. Rift Beasts are dangerous, invasive predators that have the ability to tear through reality to hunt down their prey. How dangerous? Let’s hear it from the Hunt Master himself: “Tell me, how far have you seen a predator travel in search of prey? What if I told you of a predator that tears rifts into other times to sate its hunger?” “It should run out of prey, compete with other predators for resources, but no. It lunges from its rifts fat and strong, too strong to be slowed by its rivals and too ravenous to not wipe out its prey.” “It’s only a matter of time before the wilds of my home falter and become a wasteland, picked clean by the Rift Beasts. Your time will be next, and it won’t be alone. If left unchecked, the Rift Beasts would make all of reality their prey.” Of course, the Rift Beast is not going to be happy to see you approaching their nest, and will fight with all they have. After defeating a Rift Beast, you can choose to spare one of three hatchlings which will evolve your Rift Beast’s lineage based off of the specific chosen trait. This, however, is only the first step of the evolutionary path for the Rift Beast, and the rewards it can offer. What is a Rift Beast’s Lineage and traits? Let’s get into it. Evolution Now that your Rift Beast’s chosen Lineage has begun, you will continue to hunt down the Rift Beasts throughout Eterra. Continue adventuring throughout the world and Echoes, and you’ll find yourself encountering both Torn Rifts, and Mysterious Rifts. Activating a Torn Rift will summon the descendants of the Rift Beast which you will be able to fight, and defeat for your chosen rewards. After slaying enough Rift Beasts from Torn Rifts, you’ll encounter another Mysterious Rift. The Mysterious Rift however, will send you back to the Ancient Era again, where you will be presented with an opportunity to further guide the evolution of their Lineage. Starting with a maximum of four Evolutions, you may find additional ways to expand your build-a-beast configuration, forcing even further evolution. Evolution isn’t just a visual change. With each Evolution, the Rift Beast will gain new abilities and powers, as well as provide additional loot, including one guaranteed type of Primordial Material, which you will need in order to obtain Primordial Items. While within the Evolution panel, you also have the option to end the Rift Beast’s current Lineage and restart. Build a new, stronger, more rewarding Rift Beast, or perhaps one that’s a little easier to defeat. The Hunt Master The first question after acquiring your Bones, Feathers, and Fangs is “Why am I holding all these animal parts?” The next question...",1754928095,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1803566692_1754929452_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

899770,Eterra Monthly: July. Edition 2025,"Hello Travelers, There are reports flooding in of odd creatures attacking settlements all over Eterra. Our reporters haven’t found any evidence to substantiate these claims, though more than a few have gone missing. These incidents come in on the heels of the missing Wengari Hunter from last month, who has since been found! As these claims continue to thunder in like a stampede, please be on the lookout for our missing reporters. We miss them dearly. In other news, a report of a pulsing purple gate appearing just outside of Majelka has been making its rounds recently. Some witnesses claim to have seen a Traveler entering the Temple of Majasa only moments before. Whether or not these two events are related, we do not yet know, but this reporter intends to find out! But until then, we have other news to reflect on, so let’s get into the thick of it. Season 3: Beneath Ancient Skies Trailer The long-awaited Season 3 Trailer is finally here! If you haven’t seen it yet, check it out below. Season 3: Beneath Ancient Skies launches on August 21st. Patch Review There were no full Patches in July. With Season 3 so close on the horizon, we have a lot of ground to cover before we’re all sent to fight living fossils. The devs have a lot on their hands. With that in mind, we want to take this opportunity to thank you, the Traveler, for helping EHG make Last Epoch the game it is today. Your feedback, Suggestions, and Bug Reports have been integral to the success of Last Epoch, and we will never forget that. Once Season 3 launches, we invite you all to keep being your best selves. If you see something wrong in-game, let us know using the In-Game Bug Reporting Tool in the ESC Menu. You can also find it on the character selection screen if needed. Once there, please try to use the following template to help our team replicate the issue so they can solve it faster: 1 - (Describe what you were doing, where you were, online or offline?) 2 - (Describe the new action that started the bug. “I used a skill/talked to an NPC/something else) 3 - (Describe what happened as a result. This is where you describe the bug you want to see fixed.) Using this template will be so helpful to our team. I know it takes a bit more time and can be tedious, but the result is well worth it. I promise. Hotfix Rollout 1.2.6.2 - Fixed an issue that could result in player log files bloating to extremely large sizes. - Fixed an issue where the in game shop would flash fully white when attempting to watch preview videos. Eyes on Eterra The Last Epoch Planner is here! Discord user Musholic has been hard at work developing a tool for all of us. But instead of trying to explain it to you, we feel like it would be better to hear it directly from the creator. “Ever wonder if +10% increased cast speed is better than +10% critical chance for your DPS? Or if +10% ward retention is truly better than +100 armor for your defenses? Last Epoch Planner takes the guesswork out of these crucial decisions. By importing your items, skills, and passives, you can see a detailed breakdown of your stats, with instant feedback on what will be an upgrade for your build. Last Epoch Planner is built on the foundation of the renowned Path of Building. Please keep in mind that the tool is in active development, not all stats and skills are supported yet, and its accuracy is constantly being improved. But as an open-source project, it will evolve with regular updates, and community feedback is highly encouraged. I invite you to explore your build's potential and watch the tool grow with the community!” You can check out all of the details on Musholic’s most recent Reddit Post and try it out for yourself. Mike's Teasers This month was a touch lighter on teasers, and that can be blamed on two things. First, Mike needed some time to rest. He puts in a lot of work to help the studio bring you content you can enjoy. The second reason is…. Season 3 is just around the corner! Giving away all of the amazing details before it gets here would take all the fun out of the experience.

899770,Eterra Monthly: June. Edition 2025,"Welcome, Travelers to the Eterra Monthly June 2025 Edition. We had a slow start this month but that’s only so we could save our energy for a sprint towards the end of it! Teasers, trailers, sales and Steam updates - everything that’s happened and is still happening in the world of Eterra is waiting below, so let’s dive in! Season 3 Release Date The hunter becomes the hunted… Last Epoch Season 3: Beneath Ancient Skies launches August 21st, 2025! Check out the teaser above and join the discussion in our Forum post here. Patch Review June saw our team upgrade the Unity engine to Version 6. While we did not expect there to be any noticeable differences for players, we received reports that character movement felt better and server connection felt faster, though we have no confirmation that this is a result of the engine upgrade. We also saw players reporting that Damage Numbers looked different; this was not a deliberate change. However, we did see reports of loot filters being unequipped, certain Maps not loading, and an LE-51 issue affecting some players. The team managed to quickly get out a hotfix though with those bugs squashed, others became noticeable. Shortly after Hotfix 1.2.6.1 was deployed, the decision was made to fully revert the Unity 6 upgrade so that our players would be able to play Last Epoch without any prolonged impact. Our team continued to work on the Unity 6 upgrade in order to deploy it again as soon as possible, which saw Patch 1.2.6.2 release on June 30th. This Patch has all the same fixes present in Patch 1.2.6 and Hotfix 1.2.6.1, as well as addresses all the same issues that led the team to revert to version 1.2.5.2. As before, we do not expect there to be any noticeable changes for players however, should you notice any bugs or something you wish to report, please use the In Game Bug Reporting Tool (F8) to report these issues to us. Making sure that a screenshot and your player data are attached also helps our teams investigate! https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/1/f/1f250c264c8e526e173a9f44f33d0252330883a6.jpeg June 9th - Patch 1.2.6 Upgraded engine to Unity version 6 This engine upgrade is for development purposes, and we do not expect any noticeable differences with this engine upgrade. Please continue to use the in-game bug reporter if you happen to encounter any bugs or issues. June 30th - Patch 1.2.6.2 The following issues were briefly present before the reversion to version 1.2.5.2 and should no longer be present in Patch 1.2.6.2; Fixed an underlying issue present in 1.2.6 that could cause disconnects when attempting to enter various scenes Some unrelated instances of this issue may still occur. If you experience this, please submit an In Game Bug Report with your Player Data attached, as these logs are incredibly useful to our team.

Over the years, this program and its members helped shape the gameplay of Last Epoch, from Dungeons to overall balance, and as the world of Eterra has grown, so has the CT program, which held hundreds of members. One thing we heard consistent feedback from our community on was how major content releases felt “solved” as early access to character builds and systems through the CT Program allowed for highly optimised build guides to be published before players had the opportunity to theorycraft for themselves, removing some of the excitement of discovery and exploration. Recently we announced that media partners and content creators will no longer be eligible to participate in the CT Program, but we have done some other larger changes to the program as a whole to make it more efficient.

899770,Last Epoch Patch 1.2.6.2 Notes | Unity 6 Engine Redeploy |,"Hello Travelers,Earlier this month we released Patch 1.2.6, the Unity 6 engine upgrade. While we did not expect this update to have an noticeable impact on player experience, a small amount of issues arose and after an initial attempt to hotfix these, the decision was made to rollback Last Epoch to version 1.2.5.2 in order for the team to assess the situation and allow players to continue to enjoy Eterra without any continued impact on gameplay.Today we are redeploying Patch 1.2.6 as Patch 1.2.6.2.

899770,Making Last Epoch | Skill Design,"There is an overwhelming amount of theorizing around skills in Last Epoch. Whether you’re building a map clearing, Abby killing, flashy looking Paladin, or just a Primalist who collects furry friends because the Capybara needs buddies, you can bet your skills will need to be planned out. But what keeps a skill in check? What does it take to build something that looks good, feels good, and doesn’t break everything else in the process? The answer… a lot. Thankfully, we have a team of passionate and skilled developers who focus on these exact questions.Today, we will hear from our very own Justin Carpenter, Technical Game Designer for Last Epoch, to walk us through the process of how a skill like Heartseeker was pulled from the Quiver of ideation and fired into the hands of Travelers just like you.Justin? Take it away!IdeationWhen Great Minds Play the Same GameWe have an endless list of abilities we'd like to add for each Class, so when picking which new ability will be added, we try to choose one that fits what that Class or its Mastery needs most. For Marksman, the answer was easy: it needed a good single-target damage skill, and we were very interested in creating our own spin on Diablo 2's Guided Arrow, so we were certain that Heartseeker was the skill we wanted to add. What was harder to answer is how exactly it should function. FunctionAnd FashionWe created some quick prototypes of several different variants of the ability, trying out different mechanics for how the arrow would move or pick targets. We knew this would be a very spammable skill, so we had to ensure it was performant, would work well in online mode, and that the visuals could strike a good balance between impressive and not too noisy when used very rapidly. From those considerations, we settled on it picking a specific target and repeatedly striking it until dead, at which point it would pick a new target, always only ever striking its current target.The arrow only ever striking its chosen target allowed us to do some tricks under the hood to make it much more performant than traditional projectiles, and keep the visuals responsive and accurate in online mode despite the arrow's exceptionally high speed.BalanceAs All Things Should BeWhat took a lot of discussion and math was the Recurve Chance. Heartseeker has a chance to ""Recurve"" upon hitting its target, which is what allows it to turn back and strike the target again. As this was the ability's unique property, we wanted to ensure players could scale this value up high and get arrows that persist for an impressively long time, but we also needed to avoid the stat becoming excessively powerful relative to other choices. After lots of math, formulas, and testing, we eventually settled on your Recurve Chance being multiplied by 0.8 each time it recurves. This was chosen because it helps constrain the value of stacking Recurve Chance, but also, quite importantly, it offered a simple description of its behavior that players could intuitively understand.The Great DebateWhat ended up being most contentious was how it would look when moving. We had two camps internally, with some wanting it to move in a straight line back and forth through its target, while others wanted it to curve erratically as it returned to strike its target. We ended up settling on having it move in a straight line as a base visual, and offered the curving visuals as a node in its skill tree. As a skill tree node, though, we had to position it between two extremes - it shouldn't feel like a wasted point for players who want the alternate visuals, and it shouldn't feel mandatory for players who don't want the alternate visuals. We opted to give it some slow chance, as that is a valuable effect unrelated to damage, and which can be fairly easily provided from a variety of sources.Designing the Skill TreeA.K.A Studio Arbor DayWhen designing the skill tree, our flow is to have many members of the team fill up a big list with any and every idea they'd like to see as a node, and then a single designer takes on the task of crafting the tree, using the list as a well of endless ideas to pull from. There are a lot of considerations for skill trees:The nodes and sections of the tree should be positioned in logically related spotsThere should be moderate amounts of depth to the tree, with a few options that are 4 or 5 nodes deepThere should be a breadth of options closer to the start of the tree, especially with more interconnectedness near the startCommonly desirable nodes should be fairly accessible, while niche or unusual nodes are more difficult to reachThe tree should offer a decent variety of ways to build the skill, and individual nodes should not be so potent that you feel forced to build it in a particular wayWhere possible, the overall layout should try to feel unique from other skill treesWith Heartseeker's skill tree, it ended up splitting fairly neatly into 4 general sections: Recurve Chance and effects, Damage Over Time...",1749226426,
899770,Eterra Monthly: May. 2025 Edition,"Welcome, Travelers to the Eterra Monthly May 2025 Edition. This month we have a smorgasbord of recaps, summaries, and a brand new Community Build Spotlight, so let’s dive in! Patch Review May brought three significant Patches, addressing several bugs, improving visuals, and adding QoL changes based on your feedback. Below are the highlights from each update as well as links to each full Patch Notes post! May 8th - Patch 1.2.3 Fixed an issue where player was unable to properly use Flame Rush while channeling Focus with Mana Guide equipped. Fixed Crest of Unity not forcing Elemental Nova to have all elemental tags. Fixed a bug with Volatile Reversal where allocating Immutable Past did not prevent triggering effects that require being able to jump backwards in time, such as Warped Time. And More May 15th - Patch 1.2.4 Improved environment visuals in the Desert Canyons. Improved environment visuals in the Great College. Improved environment visuals in the Storm Swept Isles. And More May 22nd - Patch 1.2.5 Fixed a bug where effects which recover a flat amount of remaining time from a skill’s cooldown were recovering a percentage of the skill’s cooldown as if it had no sources of Increased Cooldown Recovery Speed. Fixed a bug where Rive, when used with a two-handed weapon and shield due to Forgemaster’s Might, would use the two-handed visual effects, rather than the one-handed effects. Fixed a bug causing Raptors to be summoned above the Companion Limit when the number of available skill points for Summon Raptor changed, while also having summoned other companions. And More Hotfix Rollout We released six Hotfixes this Month, below you’ll find a list for each Hotfix and a link to each thread. May 2nd - Hotfix 1.2.2.2 Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where some players were blocked from unlocking Empowered Monoliths. Fixed issue where item links only showed white text with a colored underline. Other Changes The time it takes for a tooltip to appear when hovering an item label on the ground has been reduced. Eternal Supporter packs have been removed from the store. May 8th - Hotfix 1.2.3.1 Fixed an issue preventing the use of abilities in WASD mode after interacting with objects. Fixed an issue causing items in the stash and vendor window to become greyed out. Fixed issue where loot filter rules could end up being endlessly duplicated. May 9th - Hotfix 1.2.3.2 Reverted a change that caused erroneous skill point loss notification spam. As a result, we’re still working on a fix for the skill panel blinking indicator that is meant to fire when an item with +X to skill is unequipped. May 15th - Hotfix 1.2.4.1 Reverted a fix for labels not always updating when you turn off the filter. This resolves an issue introduced with the 1.2.4 patch where item labels would move around making them hard to click. May 23rd - Hotfix 1.2.5.1 Fixed Minions and Companion portraits not showing in the top left corner. Fixed Stash Button not working in certain UIs. Fixed an issue that caused loot labels for Runes, Glyphs, Shards and Woven Echoes to not disappear after the item was picked up. This was a visual only bug and any Runes, Glyphs, Shards or Woven Echoes that appeared to not be picked up were correctly sent to the players Inventory. May 30th - Hotfix 1.2.5.2 Fixed an issue where some item labels would not be visible after a significant amount of loot dropped in a short period of time until the loot filter was disabled then re-enabled. This was most noticeable when triggering Prophecies. Eyes on Eterra Season 2 Stats New Season. New content. New Bosses. New Stats! With a significant amount of new content to explore and a near-complete overhaul to the Sentinel Class, it’s no surprise that a large portion of Travelers fell in to the Void Knight path or became a Paladin of Eterra before doing their best Lara Croft impressions. Though once Tombs and Cemeteries were raided, after Woven Echoes had been exhausted and Travelers stood over the slain body of Aberroth, a new challenger called from the Threshold of Eternity. Uber Aberroth, and with a KDR 122.5 times higher than their classic counterpart, he was not merciful, likely contributing to a good portion of the 10.6 million SC player deaths. The 392 player deaths that occurred at Level 1 cannot be blamed on Uber Aberroth however, so don’t try. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/1/c/1c964165a6ae08d28c6a06e4b0c448c74c3337c2.jpeg Twitch Drop Redux While this Redux is now over, we hope you were able to snag any cosmetics or pets you didn’t grab the first time around!

899770,Last Epoch Patch 1.2.5 Notes,"The team is already aware of some issues that are visible in this Patch. We are working to fix these issues as soon as possible. Minions and Companions don't have portraits in the top left corner Some Loot filter UI issues, such as Rules showing the wrong order number, introduced after our extensive optimization pass. These issues are purely visual and the filter itself is working as intended. Bug Fixes Skills Fixed a bug where effects which recover a flat amount of remaining time from a skill's cooldown were recovering a percentage of the skill's cooldown as if it had no sources of Increased Cooldown Recovery Speed. For example: if you triggered an effect which recovered 2 seconds from Teleport's cooldown, it would always recover 40% of its cooldown, even if Teleport's cooldown was reduced to 2 seconds by sources of Increased Cooldown Recovery Speed. Now, if Teleport has a 2 second cooldown, that effect will recover 100% of the cooldown. Fixed a bug where Rive, when used with a two-handed weapon and shield due to Forgemaster's Might, would use the two-handed visual effects, rather than the one-handed effects. Fixed a bug causing Raptors to be summoned above the Companion Limit when the number of available skill points for Summon Raptor changed, while also having summoned other companions. Fixed a bug where the visuals for Harvest would not scale in size alongside the increased area of Harvest. Fixed a bug where Acid Flask Traps created from sources of extra projectiles would sometimes appear visually to be floating. Fixed an issue with navigation that could lead to players getting stuck when using Evade with the Flames of Midnight ring equipped. Divebomb Changes Made a number of changes related to Dive Bomb and the Birds Aren’t Real node: Fixed a bug with Dive Bomb where Shadow Falcons would use Featherfall, despite Featherfall explicitly stating Shadow Falcons would not use it. Fixed a bug where the primary hit of Dive Bomb would not provide stacks of Dusk Shroud when both Flock of Crows and Birds Aren't Real were allocated. Fixed a bug where the Shadow Falcons from On Wings of Shadow would not provide stacks of Dusk Shroud from Flock of Crows unless Birds Aren't Real was also allocated. The Birds Aren't Real node has been slightly reworked. Previously, allocating Birds Aren't Real would cause Dive Bomb's damage to always scale with the the Player's stats. Now, allocating Birds Aren't Real will cause Dive Bomb's damage to scale with the Falcon's stats if it is summoned, or the player's stats if not. Updated Birds Aren't Real tooltip to clarify the mentioned rework. Dive Bomb will no longer visually display the Minion tag if Birds Aren't Real is allocated, and there is no summoned Falcon. Controller Fixed Quick Move prompts for Nemesis Egg Panel. Fixed controller issues that could prevent users from interacting with the environment after killing Aberroth. Monolith, Dungeons Fixed chest in the Monolith rest zone not giving loot after a Quest Echo In the Woven Echo, Tomb of Vessels, Majasa no longer dives into the sand at all, and summons the crystals through a spellcast instead. Fixed an issue where discovering Tombs could auto-complete a location’s objectives, including unrelated quests. Fixed a bug where Soulfire Bastion Dungeon objectives would appear twice on the minimap instead of once, as intended. UI Fixed an issue where loot filter numbers did not visually refresh when reordering them. Some causes of this issue still exist, as explained at the top of this post, we are working to fix them as soon as possible. Fixed the alignment of the loot filter icon in the loot filter settings. Fixed some text inputs incorrectly allowing rich text to be inputted. These locations should still accept the same text as before, but will display it as typed. Fixed an issue where skill node respecs caused by the loss of extra skill points would not trigger the red circle UI on nodes and notifications properly in multiplayer. Fixed a bug where opening the Weaver Tree while a social panel was open caused those interfaces to overlap. Visual Fixed ailment icon text wrapping when it show 999+ stacks. Fixed a visual bug where environment decals could be applied on top of Heorot. Fixed a visual issue with the Husk of the Living. Fixed an issue where videos that had no audio track would fail to play. Fixed a bug where the Lightning Meteor VFX conversion from Vilatria's Downfall was yellow instead of blue. Fixed an visual issue where smoke could obscure gameplay after the Champion Engineer Torv used Torv’s Ballista. Other Fixed a bug where the player could become immortal under certain conditions after pausing the game in Offline Mode. Fixed a visual bug with Sentinel in the Character Select screen where you could refresh the animation by re-clicking.

Improved environment visuals in the Storm Swept Isles. Updated the VFX for Dragonfire from the Dragonsong unique bow. Added VFX for Caches so they are easier to notice. Removed the extra spacing that appeared after the Memory Amber cost in the Weaver Tree respec modal. Improved the visuals of the Winged Fire enemy, which was previously too dark. Added VFX for the Downfall of the Righteous unique item to indicate the range at which enemies are inflicted with Witchfire. Fixed a visual issue where Annointed’s Consecrated Aura from Judgment was visible from underneath bridges. Fixed flickering effect in the Time Slow aura from the Time shrine. The Void Amalgamation and Infernal Husk have new foley, vocalizations, and skill sound effects. Fixed an animation issue with Sentinel’s Shield Rush where the shield would float to the side. Rotated the Blade Of The Forgotten Knight’s inventory icon to match orientation of other swords’ icons in game. Updated the Mage’s casting animation when channelling to a more dynamic version. Loomwalker's Silk Slam animation now better matches where the attack deals damage. Quality of Life Updates Negative ailments such as ignite, slow, marked for death, etc are now cleansed when returning to the Echo of a World or the Monolith of Fate. Instances of ""chance to bleed"" descriptions have been updated to ""chance to inflict bleed"" for clarity and better readability. The player can now use the report bug panel while opening the recolor option list in the loot filter, allowing screenshots of that panel to be captured in in-game bug reports. Tomb and Cemetery entrance indicators now have a different icon than the echo objectives for improved navigability. The Void Mines fired by Void Prophets and by Maul Heart the Pale Enforcer will now dissipate when the enemy that fired them died. Bug Fixes Fixed a bug where the Ice Barrage attack of Ice Elementals and similar enemies would fire icicles that looked misaligned. Fixed an issue where Runemaster's Trinity of Elements invocation was spawning the three elemental beams on top of each other, rather than offset around the player. Fixed edge cases with movement abilities which could cause bosses such as Rahyeh the Black Sun to disappear from the arena. Fixed a case where Forgotten Knight faction progress could reset when playing multiple HC characters. Fixed the visuals for the chains breaking after interacting with the lance in the Tomb of Morditas. Fixed invalid loot filter files causing UI issues when they are loaded. Fixed a bug where, after allocating Doctrine of the Anvil, repeatedly using Multistrike while standing still would sometimes result in Multistrike failing to start. Fixed an issue where a replaced Evade (such as Terrify) was counted as short-ranged for the purposes of the WASD “Short ranged follows movement” movement setting. Fixed an issue where the Woven Echo reward panel quick move actions were not showing or working properly. Fix issue with Primalist’s Spriggan Form not triggering its stun animation correctly. Fixed a issue where champions’ energy VFX would not get deactivated on death. Fixed a bug where the VFX for Armor Shred lingered for a few seconds after the Armor Shred effect ended. The Fire Ground DoT fields spit up by Fire Lizards should now only ignite, and no longer shreds fire resistance. Penance can now only trigger on the affected target once every 0.35s. We don't want to remove the capability for Acolytes to hurt themselves to trigger other effects, but we need to prevent infinite damage loops that were hurting the servers even more than the Acolytes. Fixed a bug where reducing Smite’s mana cost below 0 while Desperate Measures was allocated could significantly raise Smite’s mana cost while at negative mana Fixed a bug where Judgement’s Righteous Decree node could cast Smite while Smite has a non-zero mana cost and you are at negative mana Echo Objective changes Changed unstable rifts spawns from 2 - 3 to always 2 Increased the loot for clearing unstable rifts when running the echo for the first time Increased stability reward from 2 x base stability to 2.6 for 1 rift and 3.2 for 2 rifts Exiled mages echo Reduced Exiled mages spawn from 2 - 3 to always 2 # Weaver Tree imprint node changes: - Fixed a bug that caused imprint item nodes to drop items less frequently than intended. - Imprint items more consistently drop items similar to them (they retain the chance to drop other uniques of the same item type, but this chance is much lower than in 1.2.3). - Fixed a bug that could cause rare and exalted items dropped by imprint item nodes to display as normal items instead of their actual rarity. - Reduced the chance of imprint nodes dropping magic items instead of rare or exalted ones. *Developer note*: The updates to imprinted item nodes released in patch 1.2.3 unintentionally caused items to appe...",1747324838,['patchnotes']

899770,Last Epoch Hotfix 1.2.3.1,Bug Fixes Fixed an issue preventing the use of abilities in WASD mode after interacting with objects. Fixed an issue causing items in the stash and vendor window to become greyed out. Fixed issue where loot filter rules could end up being endlessly duplicated ,1746738696,['patchnotes']
899770,Last Epoch Hotfix 1.2.3,"Bug Fixes Skills Fixed an issue where player was unable to properly use Flame Rush while channeling Focus with Mana Guide equipped. Fixed Crest of Unity not forcing Elemental Nova to have all elemental tags. Fixed a bug with Volatile Reversal where allocating Immutable Past did not prevent triggering effects that require being able to jump backwards in time, such as Warped Time. Fixed a display bug with Volatile Reversal where allocating ‘Immutable Past’ did not remove the buff UI icon displaying how long you have remaining on your ability to re-activate Volatile Reversal to jump a second time. Fixed an issue where Shield Throw would create multiple shields if Void Knight mastery was selected. Fixed a bug with Rebuke where Burst of Speed was not granting Haste, and was instead granting 25% increased movement speed. Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, Fallen From Grace and Order of Lagon could fail to convert Smite’s base damage to void or lightning respectively. Fixed a bug with the Forge Guard passive tree where many sources of Haste didn’t have their effects converted to block chance by Forgemaster’s Might. Fixed a bug where Heartseeker would target invulnerable enemies. Fixed a bug where Heartseeker would prioritize targeting certain enemy types over others. For example, Exiled Mages could not be targeted unless there were no other enemies in range. In the Bladedancer passive tree, Argent Veil has been clarified to state that it only triggers when damage taken by enemies puts you below 70% health (rather than any means of dropping below 70% health). The alt text for Shadow Cascade now has additional information clarifying that Shadow Cascade has 10% base critical strike chance, instead of the typical 5%. Fixed a bug where the visual trails for Umbral Blades would travel less distance than the blades in the ground. Fixed a bug where a portion of Dread Shade visuals would be inside of the minion they were attached to. Fixed a bug where Thorn Shield stayed in spawn place after scene transitions. The Blizzard’s Wrath, Thunderous Storm, and Grand Cyclone nodes now display subskill tooltips for Tempest Strike’s spells, allowing their descriptions and tags to be viewed. They do not currently offer DPS estimates. Fixed a bug where changing summoned minions in town could cause both types of minions to be auto re-summoned when exiting the town. Fixed an issue where players could get stuck after using movement abilities in the Tundra near the inactive bridge. Imprinted Items Made a number of fixes and changes to Imprinted items: Fixed an issue where altering the original imprinted item could affect the imprint itself. Fixed a bug where imprinted Unique, Set, and Legendary items were unable to result in generating different Uniques or Sets than the imprinted one. Fixed imprinted item remaining Weavers Will and Affix tiers not correctly corresponding to dropped item average Weaver’s Will for imprinted Legendary Weaver’s Will items. Fixed an issue where replacing an imprinted item on the Weaver Tree sometimes didn’t remove the other item visually. Added a chance for imprinted normal/magic/rare/exalted items to result in drops of Unique and Set items of the same item type. Reworked Forging Potential roll for similar items. Low and medium Forging Potential imprinted items result in drops with higher FP on average, and even low Forging Potential imprinted items have a chance to result in items with normal Forging Potential. Guests’ Imprint nodes now work as long as the Host has the same imprint node. The guests’ imprinted items are used for their drops instead of the Host’s. This does not include Woven Echo imprint nodes. Dungeon, Monolith and Quest Fixed a bug where using Portal charms would result in one more mod than intended for dungeon tiers where a mod was added when you started the dungeon. Fixed a bug where the each cast of the Imperial Soulmage’s Hungering Soul ability would permanently increase the damage of any Flaming Soul cast by the Imperial Pyromancer. Fixed an issue where dying on the Monolith Hub with items around you could visually duplicate the items on the floor. Fixed a bug that prevented the quest pulse directing you to the Temple of Eterra from appearing after defeating the Giant Weather Statue boss in the Courtyard. Fixed an issue where the Eternity Cache would not play its reveal visual effect. Fixed an issue where you could see Memory Amber remaining from previous zones. Fixed an issue where players could interact with a echo portal and a Cemetery entrance/exit in the same frame, causing transition errors and preventing movement. Items Fixed a bug where the Loom Walker idol (increased stun chance and added stun avoidance) was acting as a multiplier to other sources of increased stun chance, rather than adding to them. Fixed a bug where Mantle of the Pale Ox was giving an amount of increased health for the player that was different from what was stated. For existing items, the listed val...",1746720049,['patchnotes']

899770,Eterra Monthly: April. 2025 Edition,"Hello Travelers, Welcome to the Eterra Monthly: April Edition! The month of April was a giant leap forward for Last Epoch. After a 9-month wait, Travelers all over the world were finally able to launch the 1.2 Season 2: Tombs of the Erased Patch! With new friends, challenges, skills, Factions, gear, Echoes, and so much more, April gave us a lot to talk about. So let’s dive in and see how things are going in the world of Eterra. Patch Review Patch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased was the launch patch for Last Epoch Season 2. Travelers flocked to the servers in an enormous show of support. While there is simply too much to talk about in this one blog, we will go over some of the big things Season 2 brought us. For all of the other juicy details, check out the Massive 100+ page Patch Notes, or the Hype Week Blog Posts 1, 2, 3, & 4. The Woven *“Rejoice, Traveler! We’ve prepared a Silken Tomb for you. Woven with golden strands that even you cannot break.”* Masque delivered this line to us more than a month ago with the reveal of the Season 2 Trailer. It’s enough to make your skin crawl, and boy, did the Weaver deliver! The Woven Faction is the newest Endgame Faction for Travelers to join after completing their first Tomb or Cemetery in the Monolith of Fate. After this, Travelers will be taken to a new Monolith Island called The Haven of Silk. On this island, Travelers will be free to speak with Masque and spend Memory Amber so they can progress through the Faction ranks. As Travelers earn ranks and complete challenges, they will earn Weaver Tree Points that can be spent in the Weaver Faction tree, allowing them to manipulate their Echo map. Travelers can also visit the Woven Altar inside the Cemeteries to slot Woven Echoes into their Echo map for new and exciting challenges. Heartseeker Have you ever wanted to destroy hordes of enemies with a single arrow? Have you ever wanted to compete with Legolas and save your arrows at the same time? Have you ever wanted to do both of those things and whistle a discordant tune while doing it? Well, now you can. Heartseeker is the newest Skill in the Marksman skill arsenal and is unlocked at 30 passive points in the Marksman Passives tree. Launching a ranged projectile with the ability to recurve to the same target repeatedly, Heartseeker is highly capable in both Hit and DoT style builds to bring high-health targets to their knees. With Heartseeker, you will find a new mechanic in Last Epoch: Recurve Chance. Sentinel Rework While Volatile Reversal may have the spotlight for the Sentinel Rework, there’s a whole lot of other changes for the class with this update in both Skills and Passives. Since this is a significant overhaul of the class and its subsequent masteries, we encourage you to check out all of the details in the Patch Notes and Hype Week Blog Post #2 linked above. Hotfix Rollout Season 2 has come with 8 Hotfixes and Patches thus far, making it our largest game improvement to date! Let’s take a look at what changed since the Season 2 launch. 1.2.0.1 Fixed performance issues related to loot filters and related UI elements Fixed Echoes not counting as failed in some cases Fixed keys from Season stashes not merging into Legacy stashes Fixed Echoes not reducing rewards and enemy density and adjusting shrines on repeat attempts 1.2.0.2 Fixed a bug where Lizards could be spawned multiple times in Vault of the Barnacle Fixed an issue where Loot Filters with a large number of rules would cause a frame hitch when opened Fixed a bug where Smite MTX was removing the visuals for Fissure And plenty more!

Fixed an issue where using Healing Hands as a traversal skill could put players under the map.

Made a number of fixes to the Draal Queen encounter: Fixed Draal Nymphs having 350% more health than intended in most scenarios.

899770,Last Epoch Patch 1.2.1 Notes,"Hello Travelers, Before we get into the patch notes, we'd like to apologize for the delayed communication regarding this morning's unplanned server maintenance. We strive to communicate promptly and transparently whenever possible, and will work to continue to improve our internal workflows to ensure that. For more information, you can check the Hotfix Notes (https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/last-epoch-hotfix-1-2-0-4-patch-notes/76490).

899770,Last Epoch Hotfix 1.2.0.4 Patch Notes,"Developer's Note Earlier today we were made aware of an unfavorable interaction with the new Imprint nodes in the Weaver Tree, where dropped items being influenced by the imprinted items were able to be used in the Forge with the Rune of Ascendance to grant much more Legendary Potential than is intended. While this was not heavily abused at the time we were alerted to it, to protect the in-game economy and player experience we quickly took the online servers down to prevent the spread of this interaction. These items with higher LP than intended - including items that were subsequently used in the Eternity Cache - will not be able to be listed in the Bazaar. We are also working to rectify these items and target accounts that knowingly abused this. Thank you to the many community members who raised this up quickly. Ensuring the integrity of the in-game economy is a top priority for Last Epoch.

899770,"Quality of Life, Dungeon & Other Improvements | Coming to Last Epoch April 17th","Hello Travelers, Welcome to the final Pre-Patch Hype Week Blog Post! This is our last Hype Week post before The Patch Notes, and today, we’ll discuss some of the Quality of Life changes, as well as a few other game improvements, coming with Last Epoch Season 2: Tombs of the Erased on April 17th. We’ll also expand on some features you may have already seen through our Announcement Trailer, Twitch Streams, Eterra Monthly Newsletters, or the recent Dev Podcasts and cover some new exciting features yet to be mentioned. So, let’s dive right in! Mastery Respecialization As a carefully kept secret until the Announcement Trailer, players will be able to respecialize their Mastery from Season 2 onwards - for a price, of course. Chronomancer Lerinne is already adept at helping you respecialize your Passive Points, and you can now respecialize your Class Mastery at the end of time. Simply choose the ‘Respecialize Mastery’ option, and Lerinne will let you know how much Gold will be required. Be aware that selecting a new Mastery will reset all your Passive Points. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/0/2/02d4371c71030afe44446bdfc5c7df15f1a3c065.gif Eternity Cache Changes Crafting is something Last Epoch is known for doing well, and we continue to improve and offer new ways for players to get creative and maximize their potential. With that, we took a look at the Eternity Cache crafting system. Taking that 2 or 3 Legendary Potential Unique and not getting the T7 Exalted Affix you’re after can be frustrating, especially if you already had a 1 Legendary Potential Unique that successfully took the same T7 Exalted affix, so we’ve introduced a quality of life change to ease that pain. However, for players wishing to truly leave their items in the hands of Eterra, that option will remain. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/5/c/5cbf46805cc7eeacbc1d9bd7152e7aa0e0eff11f.png From Tier 2 and above in the Temporal Sanctum, players will be able to choose 1 affix to guarantee crafting on to their Unique when sealing, while the rest of the Exalted affixes will be decided by the Uniques LP level and Fate. Speaking of fate, however, just like regular Forge crafting, there is now also a chance for a “Critical Success” when crafting via the Eternity Cache. This adds the potential to seal affixes past the Legendary Potential level of the Unique, so an item with 1 Legendary Potential that experiences a “Critical Success” will seal two affixes instead of one. The chance for Critical Success depends on the amount of Legendary Potential the item has and how powerful the Unique Item is, so it is very rare to see a “Critically Success” when creating Legendaries with Eternity Cache, and even more rare for powerful items. Dungeon Changes Dungeon Key Inventory You asked for a keyring to free up Inventory space, but we saw just how many keys you’d been saving and realised no one makes keyrings that big. Instead, Keys now have their own space in the Inventory UI, freeing up valuable gear space in your Stash Tabs. This allows you to also more easily see how many of each Key type you have gained, and have available to exchange, though only with a specific Vendor who’s services aren’t quite officially sanctioned in Maj’Elka. Dungeon Key Charms and Vendor https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/f/0/f07850236a6c1c9148a2631f09a2275cfbabf690.jpeg We are introducing two types of Dungeon Key Charms: Portal Charms and Scale Charms. You can only exchange your keys for Portal Charms at the Black Market Key Trader in Maj’Elka’s Upper District. Though for our loot lizard loving players, Scale Charms will instead only drop from mobs. When used at the entrance to a Dungeon, a Scale Charm will greatly increase the amount of loot lizards that spawn during that Dungeon run. Similarly, the Portal Charm will let the player travel directly to the Dungeon Boss with a random set of floor modifiers based on the tier of the Dungeon selected. The modifiers apply as if you had fought through each of those floors, but now you can jump straight to the Boss and rewards. Though for players that wish to reach the Boss the old fashioned way, or have prophecies to complete, we have made improvements to Dungeon zones based on your feedback. Dungeons are now smaller, with fewer blockers and a lower chance for dead ends. Though if you do find yourself pinned in and falling to a hoard of mobs, fret not, as there is now also another reason to pick up all those Keys you see. Dungeon Respawn https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/d/5/d5e3562ec1fb7efb139dfcf918e907c1938bf7b1.jpeg Dungeon Keys can now be spent to respawn IN the same Dungeon area where you died, or outside the Boss area if you fell while trying to defeat the Dungeon Boss. This should help make it easier to gain those Boss drops or access those unique dungeon mechanics repeatedly. Please be aware that for Hardcore Players, some specific terms and conditions...",1744300814,
899770,"Endgame, Balance and Itemization Updates | Coming to Last Epoch April 17th","Hello Travelers, Welcome to the third installment of Pre-Patch Hype Week Blog Posts! We’ve mentioned some of the new crafting options previously, and today’s Blog Post will dig into all the specifics on the Endgame Itemization potential waiting inside the new Tombs, Cemeteries, and Woven Echoes. We’ll also delve more into the balance changes beyond the Sentinel Overhaul and a few Uniques and Idols coming with Last Epoch Season 2: Tombs of the Erased on April 17th. New Features Endgame Crafting Additions We know players love our Forge, or more accurately our Crafting mechanic, and in Season 2 The Weaver has blessed us with SIX new Endgame Crafting methods to aid you on your journey through Eterra. Set Shattering A battle with emboldened foes bolstered by barrages of burning projectiles rages as you break through barricades and beat back mobs to cross The Great Bridge. Once victory is yours and all enemies have been vanquished, you will find what they fought so hard to protect - The Forge of Shattering. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/5/5/5545f2930a8f798e18aa0ef7105596c90ab33f5d.jpeg Here, you can shatter your Set items for Set Shards, which can then be used to create Reforged Set items. Each Set item will create a specific Set affix based on the Set item shattered - For example, shattering Vilatria’s Storm Downfall staff would provide 1-4 Vilatria’s Storm Downfall Reforged shards that can then be crafted onto a staff to turn it into Vilatria’s Storm Downfall Reforged. As with normal affixes, Set affixes can be crafted up to Tier 5; however, using the new Rune of Havoc, which shuffles all tiers of non-sealed affixes, you have the potential of reaching a T6 or T7 Set affix. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/e/1/e1f1855ff7110b551ec28d9635c7113d606ca6e4.png ‘But how will these items apply Set Bonuses?’ I hear you ask. When an item gains a Set affix - and items can only have 1 type of Set affix - it is considered a Set item for the purpose of the Set Bonus, with each Set affix providing 2 stats from that specific Set item. Remember, like Set items, Reforged Set items are unique enough that they cannot be combined with an actual Unique in the Eternity Cache to create Legendary items. Idol Enchanting After defeating the Boss in a Tomb or Cemetery, don’t just leave… In the final room you’ll find a Woven Enchanter, which allows you to enchant Class specific Idols - Adorned, Grand, Huge, Large, or Ornate - with new affixes, called Enchanted Affixes and some Weaver’s Touch. It can also be used to reroll the existing Enchanted Affix(es) and Weaver’s Touch for Memory Amber. Weaver’s Touch is consumed like Weaver’s Will when slaying enemies to upgrade the Idol further; this can upgrade the existing Enchanted Affixes or add a new Enchanted Affix if there is an empty slot. Another unique property of the Enchanted Affixes is that these will come from a new pool of affixes that cannot be found on Idols elsewhere and, unlike standard Idol affixes, can reach Tier 7. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/4/2/4246a0f9014457d19d69f46c422f1432c1fae34b.png Tombs will allow you to use the Woven Enchanter once, Cemeteries twice, and some Woven Echoes may allow you to use it up to four times. This number applies to each Enchant and Re-enchant and can be used on different Idols. For example: If an Altar has 3 uses, a player may choose to place an unenchanted Idol in and Enchant it, then re-enchant the same Idol for Memory Amber. This would count as two uses of the Woven Enchanter. The player could then place a different Idol in the Woven Enchanter and choose to Enchant or re-enchant it depending on their wishes; this would consume the third use of the Woven Enchanter available to them. Once an Idol is Enchanted, however, re-enchanting it will remove any added Enchanted Affixes and unspent Weavers Touch, and grant the Idol a new Enchanted Affix and new Weavers Touch amount. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/5/5/55c992696d7067e1ce64aa339fcddf3d58960c1f.gif Attribute Swapping The Observer watches all timelines, and so does the Traveler. At Oerden’s Watch, protect the Relic of the Observer in the Divine Era from the Osprix encamped in the Abandoned Tower and reclaim the Refortified Lich’s Tower from Imperial forces in the Imperial Era. Time travel between the two towers to defeat both armies and take control of the Relic of the Observer, a powerful artifact that allows you to alter the attributes of your items. Once claimed, you can use the Relic of The Observer to replace a non-sealed attribute affix - Intelligence, Strength, Dexterity, and Attunement - with a different attribute of your choosing. The tier and roll range of the replaced affix will be preserved on the new affix. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/f/9/f936aed6248a295d1d96840f38d36b3d0d4396a4.jpeg The Observer’s gaze may touch many domains, but life remains in the hands ...",1744214442,
899770,Sentinel Rework & Heartseeker | Coming to Last Epoch April 17th,"Hello Travelers, and welcome back to the Pre-Patch Hype Week Blog Posts #2! In today’s blog post, we’re covering the complete Sentinel rework and the new skill for the Rogue Marksman: Heartseeker! We will start with the Heartseeker, and save the bigger dive into the Sentinel for the latter portion of this post. If you missed the first installment of our Hype Week Blog Posts, you can see #1 right here: With us covering a new skill, a completely reworked skill, passive skill changes, and other skill changes, we find ourselves with a decently long post. For an easier to navigate version of the blog post with a linked table of contents, check our forums here: Sentinel Rework & Heartseeker | Coming to Last Epoch April 17th Heartseeker With Detonating Arrow, Multishot, and Hail of Arrows, the Marksman mastery covers area of effect style attacks fairly well, however this has presented an opening for a skill featuring high single target damage. Introducing Heartseeker. Launching a ranged projectile with the ability to recurve to the same target repeatedly, Heartseeker is highly capable in both Hit and DoT style builds to bring high-health targets to their knees. Becoming available with 30 points spent in the Marksman tree, this puts Heartseeker beyond the “chain lock”, making this new skill exclusive to the Marksman Mastery. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/f/3/f32dfc0844ef686c4faff2a4a6fd2f775f7f0672.gif With Heartseeker, you will find a new mechanic in Last Epoch: Recurve Chance. Recurve works differently from other repeating attacks, such as Shield Throw’s Ricochets or Shuriken’s Pierces. In these examples, you increase the number of effective hits with a flat increase, such as +2 Ricochets, whereas with Heartseeker, you’ll have a Recurve chance. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/6/0/608d85fa832fcf70b7a7d0437de7d300285f2ee3.png Shoot an arrow that seeks the heart of a nearby target, passing harmlessly through other enemies. Whenever it hits its target it has a chance to continue through it and Recurve to strike it again. Subsequent Recurve chance is multiplied by 0.8 each time the arrow Recurves. If the target dies, it will choose a new target. Starting with a default 100% Recurve Chance, each time Heartseeker strikes an enemy, its Recurve chance is multiplied by 0.8. This means at a baseline, it will always Recurve once, an 80% chance for a second Recurve, 64% for a third Recurve, and so on, until it fails to roll within the remaining percent chance. By increasing the Recurve chance, the minimum amount of Recurves each use of the skill will also increase. For example, with 125% Recurve Chance, it’s guaranteed to Recurve at least two times from the default one, and at 157% Recurve Chance, it’s guaranteed to Recurve at least three times. One node in particular can allow a Heartseeker projectile to ‘theoretically’ continually Recurve until it no longer has any targets remaining. Specialization As with all skills in Last Epoch, Heartseeker comes with a full skill tree, allowing you to specialize the skill extensively. Not limited to simple number changes, you can change its behavior to emphasize the exact role you’re looking for the skill to fulfill: focus on Recurve Chance to maximize the number of repeated hits, trigger Puncture to “share the love” with other enemies, or a combination of the above. Shadow Weaver’s Grasp https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/6/9/699bff6e7b141c4984fdf2878823e19c65d63d05.jpeg With Shadow Weaver’s Grasp, your Recurve chance will never drop below 66%. This means every time Heartseeker strikes an enemy, there’s a 66% chance that it will continue into another Recurve, then another, then another. With no limit to how many times Heartseeker can theoretically Recurve, this makes for a fun node for those that like their odds. Arrow of the Ravager https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/e/8ee67d19b51f058217745e2d718c23cee38ccda4.jpeg Looking for a Heartseeker that’s a bit more tactical in use rather than spam? Arrow of the Ravager offers a large amount of both Recurve chance, and damage multiplier at the cost of adding a cooldown to Heartseeker, which can be reduced with Increased Cooldown Recovery Speed. Behind this node, you’ll also find nodes to provide additional charges, and refresh a charge when you pick up a Black Arrow. Nimble Threads https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/d/8d371d59ba2b6ea5cf9d9fd5297e0ebcdcf838cc.jpeg With Nimble Threads you’ll be able to acquire a scaling source of Recurve chance through stacking Dexterity - a valuable attribute for almost any Rogue.

New Twitch Drops First things first, we will be offering all-new Twitch drops for you to collect on all participating Last Epoch streams! We will also be running a Support-A-Creator campaign as well, which grants you an additional cosmetic. For more information, check out the Twitch drops page at https://twitch.lastepoch.com/ https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/0/6/06605e090178afe80b82886111dfcf5ad22f7f8d.png Cemeteries & Tombs of the Erased In Season 2, Travelers will find new challenges in the Monolith of Fate placed by The Weaver, a Titan who seeks to create a new world free from the Void and other imperfections. In your Echoes, you will have a chance to uncover Tombs and Cemeteries of the Erased, which are new side zones filled with the Weaver’s experiments and flawed creations. Tombs and Cemeteries are the foundation for interacting with our new endgame systems in Season 2, and they also represent our first foray into procedurally generated side zones, ensuring that each area is unique and different. Inside these zones, you’ll find the Woven, who have captured souls for the Weaver and wrapped them in Cocoons. Breaking these Cocoons open will release the souls, which will then flee and possess nearby enemies. Possessed enemies gain new abilities, increased health, and damage - and when slain, they drop Memory Amber, a new currency used in the Weaver’s Faction. You’ll want to collect as much Memory Amber as you can throughout the zones. After reaching the end of a Tomb and challenging one of the Goldthread Fateweavers, you will have an opportunity to enchant your idols with some of the Weaver’s power via the Woven Enchanter device and gain a duplicate of the current echo bonus reward. While exploring the Monolith of Fate, you will also find Cemeteries of the Erased, a new Echo type that contains even greater dangers and riches. Within these Cemeteries, you will need to locate and defeat the Woven Firstborn who is guarding the Weaver’s Altar, where you may place Woven Echoes to manipulate your current timeline. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/6/2/62a746a06e2237d4743a42d359055bffffa357f3.gif The Woven Faction After completing your first Cemetery, you will be introduced to the face of the Woven Faction, Masque, and be given the chance to join the followers of The Weaver. You will progress through the ranks of The Woven by earning and spending Memory Amber, which is most commonly found in Tombs and Cemeteries. With each rank, Masque will sell you new Woven Echoes, an alternate reality constructed by the Weaver that has been captured in physical form. You will be able to conquer these unique echoes after placing them in your timeline using the Altar of the Weaver. By completing Woven Echoes and progressing through the Woven ranks, you will earn points that can be spent in the Weaver Tree, allowing you to influence the Monolith of Fate. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/5/85bdc4e6a160efc8a71a16b4de5d9da8bf3e9e7f.jpeg Weaver Tree The Weaver Tree functions similarly to a skill or passive tree but is specific to the Monolith of Fate. Further power within the Weaver Tree is gained from increasing your rank within the faction and by completing new Woven Echoes. There are a total of 50 points to be earned and allocated within the nodes of the Weaver Tree. Some nodes increase the odds of specific rewards or echo types spawning in your Monolith. Others raise the spawn rates of encounters such as Nemeses, Exiled Mages, or Loot Lizards. Some even enable target farming by imprinting items directly onto the Weaver Tree, which then have a chance to create similar items when slaying enemies, completing echoes, or opening Caches. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/9/d/9dd6c6a949d5b3efb11ceae92318c0a88b3ab674.gif https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/6/3/636eff85f012654a6b9fbab8b20a0e12592d8981.jpeg Woven Echoes Woven Echoes are fragments of Weaver’s vision of her new world and offer new and unique challenges that are not found anywhere else. Woven Echoes are new items that can drop from within Tombs and Cemeteries or be purchased from Masque at the Haven of Silk, the Woven Faction Hub, in exchange for Memory Amber. You will be able to add as many Woven Echoes as desired to your timeline via the Altar of the Weaver in Cemeteries. There are 36 Woven Echoes, providing a variety of content including new crafting rewards, interesting encounters and mechanics, the ability to affect other echoes on your Echo Web, and new endgame bosses like the Draal Queen, a tremendous insectoid broodmothe...",1744041586,
899770,Eterra Monthly: March. 2025 Edition,"Starting off with some important news, as you all may be well aware, Patch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased has been delayed from its original April 2nd launch date. The newly scheduled release date is April 17th. EHG Game Director, Judd, revealed the change with the following graphic. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/a/aa4f535fca1c9c9ad6086b27097fcc4d7823c191.jpeg EHG would like to thank you all for your un-ceasing support and look forward to an outstanding 2nd Season along side you. With this announcement, the team has also decided to reveal the date of the Patch Notes! https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/5/85f398fa35f6a165b110d1f6b93dfa1585c3e740.jpeg Mike’s Teasers March was a very different world for Last Epoch streams and with it, the teasers you have all come to expect from Mike every week. The first two weeks of March’s streams were designed as Interview Podcasts with some of your favorite streamers such as, Zizaran, Raxxanterax, and Ghazzy. These podcast streams will be kicking off again before the launch of Tombs of the Erased on April 4th and April 11th. 3-7-25 Mike was not actually present for the Podcast stream with Ziz and Raxx. Instead, the streamers were joined by the Founder of EHG and Game Director Judd, Creative Director Ross, and Principle Designer Holly. 3-14-25 The following week, Mike and Karv joined Ghazzy on his stream and gave an absolutely massive amount of spoilers sending the twitch moderators into a panic. 3-21-25 Returning to normal streams, Mike was not about to ease up on his famous teasers, bringing with him 5 glimpses into the future. The last of which was the new “Death Vacuum” that brings nearby loot out of an Echo should your character die before completion. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/8/5/8582b6e06738008f49eb18e9bd081c9b44af2a4e.png https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/e/9e13d28e1b080aa11d709a625a23521f7834f400_2_609x418.png https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/1/b/1b15a6da0a39f8b6dcfb6adf5ee2af2d8ab454ab.gif 3-28-25 Mike wrapped up the end of the month with 5 more teasers to keep us thinking all week. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/3/b/3b8f2fb6ec42b8e58b700052f0fa6829ad6fc5c9.png https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/6/a6946ecd08c79b5d57cc83cbde0aca6d81a3f3d4.jpeg Build Spotlight This month’s Community Build Spotlight goes to Demoner with their incredible “Finger of God - Healing Hands” build. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/c/2/c2588d281ad685b45e89aa5063492fc93754ae6a.jpeg “Have you ever wanted to heal your enemies to death? Well you’re in luck, the Finger of God build does just that.” This one is for anyone interested in powerful 1-button, kickback and relax, builds and can be started as soon as you unlock Healing Hands and Paladin! And the best part is, there are NO item requirements to make it work. Though the build guide does feature a few popular items such as Orian’s Sun Seal, Soul Bastion, and Firestarter Torch, or alternatively Mad Alchemists Ladle, none of these are required; putting creative freedom back into your hands. The Finger of God build makes you and your allies practically unkillable and has proven to be viable in both SCF and HC formats. Not just like any build, there are some drawbacks. The AOE does exist but it’s a bit smaller than most AOE builds are familiar with. You’ll also need to manage your mana a bit closer to make sure you don’t get stuck. For more information, please check out Demoner’s Build Guide on Last Epoch Tools and give it a try. With the upcoming Sentinel overhaul, this is sure to be a favorite build very soon. Meet the Team Travelers, we know how much you have all enjoyed meeting the EHG team. As you can imagine, Season 2 Tombs of the Erased, has the entire studio hyper-focused on bringing you our best. Because of this, instead of focusing on one individual this month, we would instead like to invite you all to meet some of our team members during the upcoming Podcast streams on Twitch. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/5/5/553736e6da5213054f58d6ab76ab6f0cc4eb5e11.png Discord Fun This past month, the Community Management team got together and started a new stream just for you! Every Wednesday at 11:30 am CST, the Last Epoch Official Discord will host a voice channel called “CM Cozy Streams.” These streams are an opportunity for everyone to hang out together, enjoy the game, and create a healthy dose of chaos at the expense of the CM team’s characters. As of the time of this blog posting, Averielle, Wick, and Kain have all been featured with community driven character builds. Ave has stepped out of her comfort zone and is being guided through a Forge Guard build, Wick has fallen victim to the chaos of the chat and plays a Warlock, and Kain seems to be rolling with the punches with a Rune Master. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/de...",1743445452,

As a matter of fact, there are so many burgeoning, rival games that they're seemingly starting to get in the way of one another.

Last Epoch is still a smaller studio in this space that looks towards each of its launches as a way to continue to sustain the studio financially and work on the things we are most passionate about. It is with a heavy heart that we are forced to move our release date of Season 2 - Tombs of the Erased, to April 17th. As we adjust our launch date, we invite our community to help us spread the word so that everyone can join in the Season 2 experience — a massive update to Last Epoch that we’re thrilled to share with you.

899770,Eterra Monthly: Feb. Edition 2025,"Welcome to the Eterra Monthly February 2025 Edition, Travelers! ’Twas the Season of love and we would love to dive in to our latest report with you. Hotfix Rollout We released a few Hotfixes this month. The first added extra client support for system updates, though more importantly, it added performance telemetry tracking for FPS and frame hitches to aid our teams' investigations. The second Hotfix addressed an issue that affected some players' access to their Offline Saves. The third and fourth Hotfixes addressed various issues related to the In-Game Chat, affecting access to Characters and some players being able to block themselves. As well as an issue where True Offline players could not return to the Character Select Screen from within the game. Eyes on Eterra A New Threat Looms… A summons went out across Eterra, with the promise of new treasures and opportunities to become stronger to entice our travelers. The strange happenings our team has been reporting on have finally revealed themselves and you can hear the call of the The Weaver here, Season 2 Launch Trailer: Tombs of the Erased, though it is for you to decide if you will answer. By the way, you may have seen some Dev Tool Shenanigans in the Trailer in the form of Blessings in the player Inventory UI. This is not something players should expect to see in-game themselves as we will never let Gregory the Intern have access to the game code again. Walk, walk, fashion, Gregory…. As Seasons change, Fashion cycles. As we approach Season 2 and the new Tombs of the Erased update, we wanted to keep you informed of the latest upcoming and outgoing ways to show your support for Eterra and Last Epoch. While we are excited to show you more of the new MTX we have already teased on Mike’s Streams, which will be coming with Tombs of the Erased on April 17th, the following Supporter packs will be leaving our shop on April 18th; https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/a/aa4f535fca1c9c9ad6086b27097fcc4d7823c191.jpeg http://store.steampowered.com/app/2303580/Last_Epoch__Eternal_Traveler_Supporter_Pack/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2303581/Last_Epoch__Eternal_Templar_Supporter_Pack/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2303582/Last_Epoch__Eternal_Vanquisher_Supporter_Pack/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2303583/Last_Epoch__Eternal_Legend_Supporter_Pack/ All of our Supporter Packs will exist together in the shop for a short period of time, this means the existing Deluxe and Ultimate Editions as well as the Abyssal Supporter Packs will remain available after April 19th. Also, please note that items from the Eternal Supporter Packs will not be added to the in-game shop as individual items once these packs rotate out, so be sure to snag your favorite before it's gone. Bringing Down the Hive Another month, another round of old bugs that we can confirm will be put out to pasture in Season 2. Rogue Passive Tree Coated Blades now only applies to directly used abilities Warpath Warrior's Fury now only applies to direct uses of Warpath Bone Curse Fixed a bug where Crippling Anguish had no effect when Signet of Agony is also allocated Summon Sabertooth Fixed a bug where Ice Bringer was summoning Ancestral Sabertooths instead of casting Ice Vortex, and those Ancestral Sabertooths did not receive appropriate stats when summoned, making them considerably weaker than intended Added a new node, Ancestral Hunter, which requires 2 points in Frost Fang. Your Sabertooth's hits have a 4% chance per point to summon an Ancestral Sabertooth that attacks nearby enemies for a short duration. Maximum of 1 point. Added a new node, Ancient Bond, which requires 1 point in Ancestral Hunter. Your Sabertooth's hits have an additional 4% chance per point to summon Ancestral Sabertooths, and they deal 20% more damage per point. Maximum of 3 points. Ritual Lake Fixed a bug causing some movement abilities to not adjust the character to the terrain. Deep Harbor Fixed a bug where some portals in Deep Harbor would appear in an inaccessible place Dummies Target dummies, such as those available at Champions' Gate, no longer have damage variance when hit. Mike’s Twitch Teasers After a long break, catching Mike's Streams to catch up with Mike's Stream Teasers isn’t always the easiest, so we’ve compiled them all here in one place for you! 02-14-25 After a few weeks away to move house, Mike reminded us all that he DID love us by bringing us gifts for Valentine's Day! Sentinel’s can look forward to a shiny new Phalanx Spear and builds that benefit from builds that didn’t benefit from automatically drinking floor potions should find a much needed reprieve in the Settings!

899770,World of Last Epoch | Creating the Universe,"Hello Travelers, and welcome back for the fourth installment of Making Last Epoch! For today’s look at the world of game development within Eleventh Hour Games, we’re going to be taking a look at World Design and Narrative with our resident Lore Master and Lead Writer: Kyle Melberg. Kyle has made a couple of guest appearances on our weekly Developer streams to answer questions about the lore of Eterra, and today we’ll be talking about what exactly “World and Narrative” is, and the process behind creating the expansive universe in which all the loot, lizards, and groles reside. World & Narrative vs. World Design Let’s start off by getting an explanation of what exactly “World and Narrative”, and “World Design” are as concepts in game development, and what separates two aspects of design that come together to help form the player’s experience. Both of these aspects work together to answer the questions in a way that feels satisfying: Where is the player? What are they fighting? Why are they fighting? How is this communicated to the player? https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/d/c/dcd2c1e7821ed040b98671d6c3d04e3dc268dd01.jpeg “World and Narrative” is in simple terms, the setting the game takes place in and the story we are telling in this world. In turn, “World Design” is taking the setting and story we want to communicate, and answering the question of how to deliver this experience to the player. It is one thing to have a grand story and world in mind, but it is another thing entirely to express that to the audience. World Design is the difference between running through a grey plane fighting featureless pill capsule shaped 3D objects vs fighting through the slums of Maj’elka against the Scalebane in order to secure the loyalty of your potential new ally Zerrick. Creating History Having covered what these concepts are, and their purpose within game design, lets jump into the process behind creating and implementing these aspects. For this, we’ve picked the recent Harbingers lore as an example, and are covering the process of their creation with Kyle. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/9/a9710479a03e0bf9fcc26188fd6d2c6c4958d206.jpeg The Harbingers began with a design goal. The larger design team identified that we needed a “Pinnacle Boss” encounter in the endgame portion of the game that could act as a clear goal for players that had reached our story campaign’s current endpoint. From there the questions we had to answer were, “Who/What are we fighting?”, “Why are we fighting them?” and “How do we communicate this to the players?”. We chose the Harbingers initially for two main reasons. Firstly, we knew that this “Pinnacle Boss” would act as the game’s final boss for an extended period of time, and out of our main enemy factions the Void stands out as the most important and thus most fitting for this role. Orobyss himself as an option was off the table due to reasons involving the yet to be released story chapters, thus we needed a group that could act as Orobyss’s most powerful servants. Secondly, the Harbingers update was originally proposed as a more “lightweight” update with less resources directed towards it. These high tier Void enemies thus were pitched to be extremely powerful Void Knights serving Orobyss, now known as Harbingers, and would use Sentinel player models with unique armor in order to be efficient with modeling and animation time. It wasn’t long at all before we went with the direction of giving the Harbingers unique models. This increased the scope but it was a decision that ultimately resulted in a far more interesting set of encounters compared to the original plan. https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/a/7/a7372dfde493e3fb3304e7c1bc6a5856062a128a.jpeg (Aberroth went through a few name changes during development) Parallel to this was the discussion of who should act as the leader of the Harbingers and thus be our “Pinnacle Boss”. While we were still considering existing and in-development assets as sources of reskins, the Forgotten Knight was one of the candidates. When it was determined that we would be making completely custom models for these new encounters that knocked the Forgotten Knight out of the running for that role (barring some brief considerations of her doing some sort of monstrous transformation before the fight), but her being involved stayed in the conversation. We had kept the Forgotten Knight in our back pocket for a long time as this mysterious character with a connection to the Void, but were never entirely sure what to do with her once it came time for her to take center stage. In the early versions of the Harbingers storyline where she acted as a twist villain, she was still your guide through your encounters with the Harbingers, and this aspect remained part of the plan. Now the question became “What is the Forgotten Knight’s role in this? Why is she helping the Traveler?” and from there answers began sp...",1739811669,

Fixed a bug where Smoke Bomb with the Cloaked Incursion node allocated would not visually expand Fixed a bug where closing the Bug Report menu with the Esc key after selecting the input field would result in being unable to control the character until closing the menu with the X button” Mike Twitch Teasers If you missed out on any of Mike’s streams, no worries, we’ve collected all the little juicy tidbits he shared on stream! 01/03/2025 Mike blessed us on the new year with a UI update sneak peek! https://forum.lastepoch.com/uploads/default/original/3X/1/2/12f5a341827d2f69cf4f982ce5acbc953da7a721.jpeg 01/10/2025 Starting the new year strong with more fun screenshots - this time showing new inventory tabs and key storage!

With the power of spamming Drain Life and Rip Blood you don’t have to worry about defenses and can focus on stacking your health, in fact, the more health you have - the more damage you do! The gear recommended to use is a Stygian Coal with 1 LP (slammed with Critical Strike Chance, Spell Critical Strike Chance, or Cast Speed), 2x Phantom Grip with 1 LP (slammed with Intelligence), and a Mad Alchemist’s Ladle with 1 LP (slammed with Spell Critical Strike Chance). What are the pros and cons of this build? Well, the pros are that as soon as you equip Stygian Coal the build is ready to go and can be played with few modifications. You also can use Reaper Form to give yourself a “get out of jail” free card when you may die. However, one of the cons of this build is that Reaper Form constantly drains your health along with Mind Over Body - so you would need to keep moving and killing.

Hi Sam! Could you tell us a little about your job and what it includes? My official role is “Lead Combat Designer” but that maybe doesn’t tell you much. I primarily work with monsters, player skills, and VFX. I help design the attacks and plans for pretty much every monster in the game, all the way from the lowest spider to the pinnacle Aberroth. I’m the guy who makes player skills in engine, directing animation and then tuning speeds, hitboxes, etc in game. I also do a lot of VFX, or at least helping the VFX artists and moving them along. Making LE is a very collaborative process, so while I do all the things above, often times I’m working with several other people, getting feedback or discussing ideas. For monsters, in addition to doing the design and writeup for them, I’m one of the guys in Unity implementing abilities, tuning animations, adjusting timing, buffing/nerfing attacks, and overall working on the in-engine part of making monsters fun and cha...",1738342898,
