As such, we adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone found to be in violation of our game rules.This includes, but is not limited to, the use of plug-ins, illegal software, inappropriate behaviour, malicious use of exploits or bugs, etc.Once such behaviour is discovered, we will immediately launch an investigation and take appropriate action. This includes, but is not limited to, permanent account bans, lP bans notification inside and outside the game, etc. At the same time, we also invite players to actively report inappropriate behavior in the game through reporting channels provides as well as through the community, in order to maintain a fair and healthy gaming environment. IMPORTANT NOTICE: Hello Operators. To improve the game's security experience, the G.T.I. Security Team has decided to expand cheater kill compensation coverage after careful consideration: ""Previously, only players affected by cheaters who received 10-year bans were eligible for cheat kill compensation. Now, players affected by cheaters who receive 30-day bans can also receive cheat kill compensation. When operators receive an email confirming a successful 30-day or 10-year ban, cheater kill compensation will be sent via in-game mail within 3 business days of that email. Please check your mail promptly."" Note: If gear brought into a match was extracted by squadmates and returned to you, that kill compensation will not be issued again. PC: This week (December 8 - December 14, 2025), enforcement actions targeted 1,846 users with 10-year bans, including 774 DMA bans/real-time interceptions/freeze actions. Additionally, 28,936 devices were blocked for one year, 5,952 cheating attempts were stopped in real time, 556 players were forced offline for cheating, and 328 warnings were issued for teaming with cheaters.

A total of 27 cases were dealt with last week, and all illicit Delta Coins/Tickets acquired through these means were confiscated. We further cracked down on the use of automated scripts, covering activities like ""automated bulk registration of accounts,"" ""automated multi-client login,"" ""auto-farming (run-through),"" ""auto-extract,"" and ""auto-sell supplies.""

2507950,G.T.I. Security | Security Brief Vol.1 -The ACE Initiative,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/9046e7cd69c951533aa6e438cdc78d13fcc13046.jpg Dear Operators, Since our launch, we read your feedback about gaming security, we saw the staggering reports, and most certainly, we all felt the frustration about cheaters. We know that high-stakes map in Operations like Tide Prison and Space City have become difficult not just because of the tactical challenge, but because of bad actors disrupting the integrity of the game. When you deploy into these maps, you expect a battle of skill, not a battle against unfair software. We want to be crystal clear: Cheating is not tolerated in Delta Force. Today marks the first in a series of Security Briefs where we will pull back the curtain on our anti-cheat efforts. We are committed to transparency, and that starts with introducing the primary weapon in our arsenal: Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). What is ACE? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/b3c7b2f0503a8de395611411c9fbbeec38d17807.png Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) is not new to the war on cheats. Established in 2005, ACE has spent two decades on the digital frontline, evolving into a premier security solution for the global gaming industry. Think of ACE as an elite overwatch unit. They don't just look for one type of threat; they offer a comprehensive, ""one-stop"" security matrix designed to protect the game environment from the ground up. By partnering with ACE, we are leveraging 20 years of data and specialized technology dedicated to one thing: preserving a fair playing field. The Arsenal: What ACE Brings to the Table Cheat developers are constantly evolving, so our defense must be dynamic. ACE provides Delta Force with a multi-layered defense system that covers every angle of our game client, from mobile to PC. Here is specifically how ACE is hardening Delta Force： {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/49c040e1fd3c94e57419c8856e44f5f01f472a94.jpg ●Industry-leading PC Solutions: For our desktop Operators, ACE utilizes multi-level solutions including client anomaly detection, cheat signature detection, and behavioral anomaly detection. This means it doesn't just look for known cheat programs; it analyzes player behavior to catch inhuman reaction times and impossible movements that suggest aimbots or wallhacks. ●Mobile Hardening: On the mobile front, ACE employs a ""prevention first"" strategy. This includes anti-debugging, code protection, and resource hardening to stop cheaters from cracking the game file itself. It actively hunts for modifiers, speedhacks, and virtual machines, issuing immediate force-quits upon detection. ●Economic & Content Integrity: Cheating isn't just about aimbots; it’s also about illicit RMT (Real Money Trading) and toxic environments. ACE leverages extensive algorithmic models to detect illicit in-game economic activities (protecting the Auction House and economy) and uses intelligent moderation to detect abusive text, voice, and images in real-time. 2025 Situation Report: The War So Far As we close out 2025, it is important to look at the data. It has been a volatile year, but our security measures have hit back hard. Throughout 2025, thanks to the integration of ACE’s evolving algorithms, we have issued over 170,000 bans to accounts confirmed to be violating our terms of service. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/767fab7eb3581e81a0d26e627e68e4b3bac32e3e.png Key upgrades so far included replay mechanics, measures against loot ESP and mobile kernel cheats, behavior detection, and more. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/e363e93fb7b113ca6c9be13483ac19edfed6b4f7.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/b99ae803188238a3534f4bc990322b83d3b090d4.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/0a214455b517889b03fdcf82033d5f560101f550.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/eab4fe21fa8f53e324cd787022fd8ccbf96ec830.png What's Next: The December Protocol {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/f10ebae80ad1f66c1e8ce906f538b276452a2756.png The battle is escalating, and this December, we are deploying our heaviest armor yet. We are thrilled to announce two major security infrastructure upgrades that will fundamentally change how we secure the Delta Force ecosystem. 1.DMA Shield (Enhanced Hardware DMA Protection) Hardware cheats have long been the ""silent killer"" of fair play. By enabling DMA Shield, we are closing the loophole that allows external hardware devices to read and write game memory without the CPU knowing. This upgrade effectively creates a steel wall around the game's memory, preventing malicious hardware from hijacking your matches. 2.Secure Boot & TPM 2.0 Integration We are locking the front door. With the integration of Secure Boot and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, we ensure that the system running Delta Force is trusted before the game even launches. This prevents ""bootkits"" and deep-level cheats from loading before our anti-cheat can detect them. Furthermore, TPM allows for significantly more accurate hardware bans, meaning once a cheater is removed, they stay removed. Prepare for Deployment With this technical leap, we will be releasing d...",1764329960,

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Hello Operators. To improve the game's security experience, the G.T.I. Security Team has decided to expand cheater kill compensation coverage after careful consideration: ""Previously, only players affected by cheaters who received 10-year bans were eligible for cheat kill compensation. Now, players affected by cheaters who receive 30-day bans can also receive cheat kill compensation. When operators receive an email confirming a successful 30-day or 10-year ban, cheater kill compensation will be sent via in-game mail within 3 business days of that email. Please check your mail promptly."" Note: If gear brought into a match was extracted by squadmates and returned to you, that kill compensation will not be issued again. PC: This week (November 17 - November 23, 2025), enforcement actions targeted 2,786​ users with 10-year bans, including 1,284​ DMA bans/real-time interceptions/freeze actions.

A total of 104 cases were dealt with last week, and all illicit Delta Coins/Tickets acquired through these means were confiscated.

2507950,G.T.I. Security | Cheater Compensation FAQ,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/e9bc73870726fe87360e89cc3aebee7b2175b716.jpg Part 1. How Compensation Works Q1: When do I get compensated? A: You'll get your gear back when both of these happen: • A cheater kills you in Operations and ends your match. • That cheater gets caught and banned for 10 years (officially verified). Q2: What exactly do I get back? A: We'll restore all the gear you lost from your equipment slots in that match: weapons, attachments, helmets, ballistic vests, backpacks, and chest rigs. Everything gets sent back through system mail in the exact condition you brought it in. Unfortunately, we can't return miscellaneous items and consumables right now. Q3: When will I see my compensation? A: Your gear will automatically show up in your game mail within 1-3 business days after the cheater gets banned. Part 2. Common Questions About Compensation Q1: If a cheater kills me, does it matter what other players extract after that? A: If your squadmates already picked up your gear and extracted it, we won't double up on those items. But in every other situation—whether the cheater's team looted you, some random third party got your stuff, or nobody touched it—you'll get everything back. Q2: Do I have to report the cheater to get compensated? A: No. Reporting doesn't affect compensation at all. Our system automatically tracks down every suspicious match involving players who get 10-year bans and provides compensation whether you reported them or not. Q3: What about the gear I stashed in containers during the match? A: Sorry, but we can only compensate gear you brought in through your equipment slots. Anything you dropped in containers or stashed elsewhere can't be returned. We recommend not bringing your good helmets, ballistic vests, or weapons in your backpack or chest rig. Q4: I voluntarily quit after getting killed by a cheater. Do I still get compensation? A: Absolutely! As long as you meet those two main conditions we mentioned, you'll get your gear back whether you stuck around or quit early. Q5: Why can't you just give me my gear back right away? A: Our security team needs time to review all the match data to make sure everything's accurate. We don't want to miss anyone or accidentally give out wrong compensation; it's all about protecting every player's interests. Q6: What if I should've gotten compensation but never received it? A: If you're certain you qualify and it's been more than 3 business days since the cheater got banned but you haven't received your compensation mail, you can contact the customer service through the in-game channels. Make sure to include all the match details you can: when it happened, the cheater's username, etc. Once we confirm, we'll issue the compensation.",1757917000,

2507950,G.T.I. Security I Economy Security & Cheater Compensation,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/efbde01f20e44f71bd960444869cfaefa5e570d4.png Dear Operators Date: July 30, 2025 The Delta Force security team is dedicated to fostering a fair gaming environment. We'll be coming down hard on anyone caught cheating or breaking our terms of service, imposing appropriate restrictions as needed. To ensure everyone enjoys a better gaming experience in the new season and beyond, our security team has recently put strict measures in place to safeguard the game's economy. On top of that, we've fine-tuned compensation standards for when players are killed by prosecuted cheaters. The new standard will be online in the new season: 1. Killed by a cheater and resulted in a failed extraction. 2. The cheater's account will be banned for 10 years. 3. Once these conditions are met, you can expect your cheater kill compensation to land in your in-game mailbox within 1-3 business days after the cheater's account is banned.  Economy Regulatory System: Offline trading often leads to risks like account theft and the influx of illicit currency. We'll be severely penalizing any involvement in offline trading. Illegal resources: Stolen Tekniq Alloys, Delta Coins/Tickets, or those obtained through fraudulent card top-ups, transferred to ""RMT"" players via the Auction House, Market, or other methods. Third-Party Top Up: Obtaining Delta Coins/Tickets through discounted top-ups on third-party platforms, including reselling at lower prices or acquiring Delta Tickets through inflated market listings of third-party platforms. Automated Activities (Scripts, Bots): The use of scripts and other automated farming, auto-extraction, or profit-making activities that significantly disrupt the player experience will result in penalties, including but not limited to confiscation of resources and account ban. Exploiting Game Vulnerabilities: Seriously undermining game fairness and other players' experiences by exploiting vulnerabilities to farm items, props, or tokens will lead to severe crackdowns, with penalties scaled to the extent of the ill-gotten gains. Players who acquire rare in-game items, high-value virtual assets, or digital currency through unauthorized means, such as exploiting programming vulnerabilities, system flaws, or data manipulation. Players who obtain resources or commercial assets from other players through illicit or irregular methods.  Penalty Examples: Date: July 21, 2025 - July 27, 2025 Regarding Delta Coins/Tickets acquired via unauthorized ""third-party platform low-price top-ups,"" our investigations have confirmed these stem from various illicit sources, including transfers from stolen accounts, fraudulent card charges, and other unofficial discounted recharge schemes. Last week alone, we addressed 129 cases, resulting in the forfeiture of Delta Coins/Tickets obtained through these illicit top-ups. We also cracked down on the use of automated scripts, encompassing, but not limited to, ""auto-farming,"" ""auto-extract,"" and ""auto-sell supplies."" Last week, we dealt with 1,147 cases, which included 567 confiscations and 580 account bans.  Official stance on exploitation any exploitation of program vulnerabilities, mechanism flaws, or data packet manipulation to acquire unauthorized rare items, high-value items, or virtual tokens is a grave breach of game fairness. We will pursue official action, with penalties escalating based on the extent of the ill-gotten gains.",1753874896,

July 9, 01:59 (UTC+0): Operations access and matchmaking will be closed, along with Market and Auction House. July 9, 02:00 (UTC+0): PC updates go live.

If you're playing on Steam, the update package is around 52.7GB, so aim for at least 65GB of free space. If you encounter any issues after updating, try restarting the game—that usually resolves it. Should you run into any errors during the update, make sure to restart the game once it's finished and check that your client version is up to date. What's New This Season: New Operations map Tide Prison, new Warfare map Cyclone; new Assault Operator Claire (Codename: Tempest); new Boss Raven (Tide Prison); new weapons KC-17 Assault Rifle and Compound Bow; new Black Site Collection Room system, new vehicles, new attachments and Class Gadgets, plus event modes, extensive gameplay optimizations and bug fixes. New Operator ● Operator - Claire Ann Byers (Codename: Tempest) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/659c1ade546f518737e56cf4f938c6a0975d5fa3.png Operator Role: Assault Operator Trait - Auxiliary Surge Spine: Tempest’s auxiliary spine activates when bullets or explosions come too close, releasing electric currents that supercharge her core muscles. This temporarily boosts her sprinting speed. When not under pressure, it passively increases her swimming speed. Tactical Gear - Drill Charge: Tempest tosses a drill forward that can bust through tough surfaces. It then spews conductive powder and electric currents that pierce through cover, disarming enemies and temporarily paralyzing them. Gadget - Combat Roll: This activates her auxiliary spine to amp up her core strength, letting her quickly roll in multiple directions. Successfully knocking down enemies reduces the gadget’s cooldown. Gadget - Emergency Evasion Device: After Tempest pops in a gas canister, this device fires a Safety Rope to secure an Anchor Point. If she reactivates the device or receives fatal damage, she'll be yanked back to that anchor spot. Operations Mode: When downed, Tempest can activate her spine to discharge a defibrillation burst, reviving herself once. Warfare Mode: During the rope pullback, Tempest briefly resists damage that would normally exceed her max HP. The Safety Rope will go into a suspended state if Tempest falls a certain distance. How to Unlock: Available in the free tier of the Season Pass. New Boss - Raven {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/bf0c9c346a478b241523c1f34f956154d4265a66.jpg ""Raven was once the former Ahsarah king's most cherished and brilliant son, but he was later betrayed and ended up a prisoner..."" Raven and his guards are always on the move throughout Tide Prison. They're incredibly dangerous, so you'll need to be extremely careful when engaging them. New Vehicles, New Attachments, New Class Gadgets ● Jet Ski: A light watercraft that can carry two people. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/e8b5e645532f6bcb3cdebcfe1b4aef016c6057ec.jpg ● Compound Bow Diversified Arrowheads: These can be fired using the Compound Bow and are designed to suit different combat needs. ● Wire-Guided Missile: A portable anti-vehicle weapon for the Engineer class that can be remotely guided to hit targets. New Action - Swimming ● Diving consumes oxygen. Resurfacing restores it. If you run out, your HP will gradually drain. ● You can choose between slow swimming or sprint swimming. Sprinting is faster but drains Stamina and depletes oxygen more quickly. ● While on the water's surface, you can use all weapons and gadgets. Underwater, weapons can't be fired, and only certain gadgets are functional. ● Weapons fired from above water can hit targets below, but bullet damage drops sharply after entering the water. ● In Operations, downed players can move slowly while underwater. In Warfare, downed players will float to the surface but can’t move until revived. ● In Operations, you can visit the Black Site - Diving Center to upgrade and boost your character's swimming-related abilities.

At the same time, we also invite players to actively report inappropriate behavior in the game through reporting channels provided as well as through the community, in order to maintain a fair gaming environment. Recently, we discovered that some players claim they can optimize game performance by modifying in-game configuration ini files. However, after investigation by our security team, we found that most players are maliciously modifying ""XXX.ini"" files to make unauthorized changes to in-game scenarios such as: grass, trees, smoke, characters, and scene brightness during matches. Our security team has also discovered that some players are promoting and teaching these methods on public social media platforms, with a small number of players spreading tutorials on websites and profiting from them.These actions seriously violate the Delta Force security guidelines, severely disrupting game balance and the fair and healthy gaming environment we have been working hard to create for all players. We have already taken action against the relevant accounts immediately. Here, the security team asks all players to abide by game guidelines and not to modify game configuration .ini files without authorization, or engage in any similar violations. Once discovered, violators will face a 7-day account ban. If similar behavior is found after the ban, we will impose more severe penalties. We promise that we will continue to take action against all violations of game rules.

Please Note: This update will require downloading 18.2GB of data. To ensure a smooth update, we recommend having at least 45GB of free space on your hard drive. Here's the schedule: April 21, 00:30 (UTC+0): All Ranked Matches will be temporarily unavailable. April 21, 02:00 (UTC+0): The PC version update will be live. If you experience any issues after updating, please try restarting your game to ensure the update is fully applied. Here's a look at the main new content in this update: New Operator ● Operator - Hélie de Montbel, Codename: Nox {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45050610/e82d55a429fc7c2d84df78bc48fb3fb85148efa0.jpg Operator Role: Assault Operator Specialty - Deep Trauma: In Operations mode, enemies damaged by Nox will take longer to use medical supplies for healing and be revived when downed. In Warfare, it increases the delay before their health automatically regenerates after leaving combat. Tactical Gear - Silent Assault: Activates a disruptor that significantly reduces Nox's sound emissions and boosts movement speed while interfering with nearby enemies. While active in Operations, recon items will only detect the disruptor's starting location, and Nox will be undetectable in Warfare. Gadget - Whirlwind Disc: Throws a small tracking drone that explodes when it gets close to enemies, dealing damage, inflicting wounds, and slowing them down. It locks onto targets faster when attacking from behind. If no target is locked, it will explode after a short delay. Gadget - Tactical Flashbang: Throws a flashbang grenade that detonates upon hitting a surface, blinding and stunning all enemies in the vicinity. How to Unlock: Available in the free tier of the Season Pass.

Tactical Markers: Commanders can use tactical markers on the map screen to precisely pinpoint locations and convey their strategic plans.

2507950,FAQ I Ask Shadow Anything Vol.7,"Dear Operators, It’s been a while since our last episode of Ask Shadow Anything. During this time, we have launched a new season for Delta Force and shared the 2025 roadmap. We hope you're having tons of fun in the new season – and if you haven’t already, we highly recommend taking a look at the roadmap on our X. We are thrilled to see your reactions, and we've received some great questions from you which we’d like to address today. As Black Hawk Down just came out last week, this update will be a bit shorter, but we always value our communication with the community, so let's get started! 1. When will Delta Force be available on consoles? As we mentioned before, the console version was planned to release in Q1 2025, but unfortunately, we need more time. The console version is shaping up nicely, but we feel that the overall user experience, especially player input, including controller balance and interaction compatibility, hasn’t yet met our standards. We don’t want to release an unpolished game, so we want to spend more time fine-tuning the console build. I know this news may disappoint some players, and we apologize for that. We're working hard and will keep you updated on the progress. In the future, we’ll provide a separate console roadmap and regularly share updates with you. 2. When will Delta Force get kill cam? We know this is a feature many players are looking forward to. We’ve already tested an early version of it in the Chinese version, and we will bring it to the global community when it’s polished enough. As of now, we plan to introduce this feature in the next season. 3. Is there a plan to introduce an equipment cap in the Easy mode? This feature is production-ready and is currently in the final stages of optimization. It will be released in the next season. 4. Will Delta Force have a night mode? Yes! In the next season, we’ll introduce night versions of certain maps, along with other new content to support this change. And this is just a part of our update plan for next season; there will be more optimizations and improvements this year to further enrich your experience in Delta Force. We’ll share more details during our next developer livestream. 5. Why does the game feel more laggy after the update? What’s the team’s plan to address this issue? Performance is extremely important to us. We’ve received a lot of feedback, and after the patch, we’ve made many optimizations. We are still monitoring frame rate changes and FPS fluctuations across different platforms, regions, maps, and modes. Thank you for sharing your experiences and game logs, and we will continue optimizing to ensure a smooth gaming experience. 6. Is there a plan to introduce progress reset in the Operations mode? We don’t have a full wipe planned, but we have some ideas in mind that we hope will cater to both players who want to relive the experience of progression and challenge, as well as those who don’t want to start over. Please stay tuned for further updates. That’s all for today’s questions. We hope you enjoy the new season content and the campaign – see you next time!",1741060829,
