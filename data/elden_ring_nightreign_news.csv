2622380,ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – The Deep of Night Explained,"“The endless night descends upon Limveld.”What is Deep of Night Mode?Deep of Night is a high-difficulty mode added to ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN. To play Deep of Night mode, you must have defeated The Nightlord named Night Aspect. Using the skills you’ve honed through countless nights, navigate through Limveld while the land is teeming with enhanced enemies and challenge an unknown Nightlord. When choosing a Deep of Night expedition, the target Nightlord will not be revealed until the expedition begins, and any ongoing Shifting Earth states will not be in effect during a Deep of Night run.  How can you survive a Deep of Night expedition? You will need to adapt flexibly to changing situations in battle. It is advisable to prepare well-rounded Relic loadouts that would be helpful during any Nightlord fight, as the Nightlord you’re hunting won’t be revealed until the expedition begins. In Deep of Night expeditions, enemies that are stronger than usual will appear and even more powerful 'variants' will stand in the way as threats to Nightfarers. You can recognize these foes by their unusual sheen of red. Do not despair, new tools and abilities will also be available to Nightfarers who take on these extraordinary challenges. New Weapon & Relic EffectsDuring Deep of Night expeditions, you can obtain weapons with multiple additional effects by defeating enhanced enemies or competing new challenges. You can even find weapons with new and more powerful effects. Since these weapons also come with detrimental effects, blindly picking them up could put you at a disadvantage. Take care to check before looting. If you choose and utilize these new weapon effects with future battles in mind, you can gain enhancements that make even powerful enemies insignificant.  Another power granted to Nightfarers is the Depths Relics, which can be obtained by completing Deep of Night expeditions. Depths Relics can only be activated during Deep of Night expeditions and feature new powers and detrimental effects not found in existing relics. These new relics can be placed in three newly unlocked relic slots, allowing for greater tactical flexibility when used in combination with existing relics.  By utilizing these weapons with multiple attached effects to strengthen your Nightfarer, you may be able to overcome the increasingly powerful enemies you’ll confront. Rating & DepthIn Deep of Night, you can increase your ""Rating"" by defeating the Nightlords to reach the next Depth. As the depth increases, enemy strength escalates. You may encounter situations where you cannot see the locations of key points on the map or where the target Nightlord is unknown until the final battle begins. In multiplayer mode, players of similar depth level will generally be matched. Sometimes, an Everdark Sovereign will appear on the third day, making the fight even more chaotic. Combine the new weapons and relics to skillfully boost your Nightfarer, coordinate with your allies, refine your own play skills, and challenge the boundless darkness.  ",1757596766,
