This update will deliver additional content, including Gogmazios, the first Elder Dragon in Wilds, and the expansion of endgame content with the addition of the Gogma Artian Weapons.In this update we also focus on improving the game's stability and performance, implementing various improvements including CPU/GPU optimization for all platforms.*Content in development is subject to change. To further improve stability and performance, additional improvements will be implemented in a patch exclusive to the Steam version in late January 2026, as well as in the Ver. 1.041 update in February.We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has reported issues and provided feedback.Your feedback has aided the development team's ongoing work to improve the overall experience through these updates. We'd like to further explain the stability and performance improvements roadmap that was shown in the December 2025 Monster Hunter Showcase.Free Title Update 4 (Available December 16, 2025)Free Title Update 4 will implement CPU/GPU optimisations across all platforms: PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.Processing Improvements and Load ReductionProcessing time will be improved by distributing the process across frames for elements that demand the heaviest load, which includes players, monsters, and graphical user interfaces (primarily the HUD and maps).Processing load is reduced by comprehensively reviewing and streamlining various processes, such as reducing the number of simultaneous effects and improving collision detection for Palico and Seikret.Various other improvements, including optimization and reduction of memory usage, will be implemented.These measures are designed to improve the experience for all players, while avoiding negatively impacting the existing game. By implementing improvements to common processes experienced by all players, we aim to resolve issues experienced by players on a wide variety of hardware configurations. Gameplay Comparisons - TU3 vs. TU4 (Steam Version)Here's a look at gameplay comparison videos showing the differences between Free Title Update 3 and Free Title Update 4 on the 'Recommended specs' of the 'Steam version system requirements'.*Testing was conducted with the frame generation setting set to ""Disable"".*Performance metrics captured using Steam's in-game overlay performance monitor. *This is only one example, and performance may vary depending on PC configuration and other environmental factors.*Content in development is subject to change. 1.

However, we confirmed that in most cases FPS goes higher than 40 FPS after applying the update.We also confirmed a frame rate improvement of roughly 5% or more in the Scarlet Forest and Oilwell Basin. While in these areas, players will generally experience higher average frame rates than in the Windward Plains. *This is only one example, and performance may vary depending on PC configuration and other environmental factors. For instance, this update yields limited improvements for hardware at the ""minimum"" system requirements, when compared to the improved frame rate seen at the ""recommended"" system requirements. Following the release of Free Title Update 4, we will continue to deliver stability and performance improvements. Next, we'll share further details on the updates planned for January and February 2026.

2246340,Rey Dau Masterclass & Concept Art!,"Hey hunters,How’s the hunting?Today we’d like to share with you some behind the scenes concept art from the development of Monster Hunter Wilds, ahead of Free Title Update 4’s release on December 16!We’ll kick things off with a recap of the Rey Dau Masterclass presentation that Monster Hunter Wilds director, Yuya Tokuda, conducted recently at the 'Monster Hunter Festa 2025 Paris' event, after which we’ll take a look at the creation process behind Arkveld and the Wudwuds!Rey Dau Masterclass Recap*Please note, the information in the images shown in this section are from development and may differ from the final product.Rey Dau rules the Windward Plains as its apex predator. Let’s take a look at each part of Rey Dau. Its head and mouth have the distinctive shape of a predator with sharp teeth designed to tear through herbivorous monsters. The structure of the operational fangs and jaws draws inspiration from the mandibles of centipedes.When Rey Dau becomes fully charged, it closes the discharge organ in its head and unleashes a powerful electric discharge attack.To withstand the force of such a powerful strike, Rey Dau exposes the charging organ from its neck and stabilises its head, then by conducting the electricity from its tail, through to its neck, it can release all the electricity stored throughout its body in one go!Rey Dau has electricity-generating organs in its body that cause it to become charged and generate electrothermal energy during attacks by dragging its charged wings and tail along the sand. The sand then crystallises and attaches to Rey Dau’s body. These non-conductive, glass-like crystals helps suppress and control electrical discharges from the monster’s internal electricity-generating organs, aiding it in unleashing powerful electric attacks.The highly textured surface of Rey Dau’s body also has the effect of drawing electricity from the charged atmosphere in a sandstorm, enabling it to become charged at an accelerated rate during Inclemency.If Rey Dau moves while covered in crystals, the pieces of ore rub against each other and emit sounds. The people of Kunafa Village gather this ore, craft noise-making items, and use them to ward off monsters.Ores are used not only for the noise-making items but also for home decorations.The decoration on the chieftain's house on the far right resembles the pattern which displays the power of the thunder attribute.This diagram depicts the symbol of the Ruins of Wyveria appearing within the game. The pattern in the top left corner represents the power of the lightning attribute. That wraps up the masterclass, but we’ve got even more concept art waiting for you below!Arkveld Here's a look into the creation of a flagship monster, Arkveld, and its piercing gaze!What are your most memorable moments from clashing with The White Wraith? Feel free to let us know in the comments.WudwudTo explain this piece of concept art, we felt it best to ask the cheeky denizens of the Scarlet Forest themselves: “Please be perceptious of Wudwud wearing fur of pink menace! Pay tribooty! Happy Time! Share!”That wraps up today’s post, thanks for taking the time to check it out! We’ll have more concept art to share with you in the future too!Thank you all for your continued feedback, support and passion.We’ll see you in the hunt!- The Monster Hunter Community Team",1764761522,

2246340,Director's Letter - A Message from Director Tokuda (August 2025),"Hello hunters! This is Yuya Tokuda, the director of Monster Hunter Wilds. Thank you so much for playing Monster Hunter Wilds. And a big thank you as well to all the hunters who have been sharing their game feedback and requests.The entire development team is carefully reviewing your feedback and working hard to implement improvements and adjustments.We apologize for the time some improvements may take, but we are committed to delivering a more enjoyable and satisfying gaming experience, so we greatly appreciate your patience.As previously announced, we plan to release the Ver. 1.021 Update on Wednesday, August 13.This update will include expanded end-game content, balance adjustments for weapons, and other adjustments and improvements.Expanded End-game ContentOriginally planned for implementation in the third title update scheduled for the end of September, we've moved up the implementation of expanded end-game content to the Ver. 1.021 update.We will be adding a new set of high-difficulty quests, and as rewards for completing them, you can obtain talismans with randomly assigned bonuses, including weapon skills.1. As a new set of high-difficulty quests, 9★ monsters will start appearing when you are HR 100 or higher.Starting with Ver. 1.021, Tempered Monsters (9★) of nine monster species will begin appearing in locales.Following that, our third title update in late September will see additional 9★ monsters appear in event quests. For veteran players who have experienced end-game content in previous Monster Hunter titles, we understand that the difficulty of Tempered Monsters at launch may have felt lacking. Therefore, starting with Title Update 2, we've introduced a system for more detailed monster parameter customization, as well as other adjustments to ensure a challenging and rewarding experience.2. We're adding the Glowing Stone appraisal item as a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters.Upon quest completion, the Glowing Stone appraisal item—a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters—will transform into an Appraised Talisman with randomly assigned skills.Unlike other talismans which can be crafted and upgraded at the Smithy, Appraised Talismans cannot be upgraded. However, they can be randomly granted not only armor skills but weapon skills and decoration slots (both weapon skill and armor skill decoration slots), allowing for more customization and experimentation with builds. We hope this leads to more engaging gameplay and encourages hunters to try different weapons and armor based on the talismans they obtain.Additionally, we recognized that end-game content early after the game's release was slightly skewed around Arkveld. This, combined with the fact that Arkveld is relatively resistant to elements, resulted in limited opportunities to try out diverse builds. In response, we have adjusted the difficulty, average hunting time, and rewards for each of the 9★ monsters being added in an effort to ensure that all monsters offer balanced rewards fitting with the effort spent hunting them. We encourage you to select your hunts based on your own individual skill, equipment, or needs, and enjoy each challenge.9★ Monster AdjustmentsIn light of the addition of 9★ monsters, we've lengthened the duration of meal effects so that they're less likely to expire if the hunts go on a little long. We also raised the upgrade limit for armor of rarity 5 or above, so that players can squeeze in a little more defense before they go up against these challenging new monsters.Additionally, from HR 100 and higher, Rey Dau and Nu Udra will now appear in the Wounded Hollow, and each region's apex predator will be more likely to appear even with that region is not experiencing an inclemency.Title Update 3As mentioned previously, Title Update 3 will see the gradual introduction of 9★ monsters in Event Quests as well. We are also adjusting the strength of support hunters in line with the addition of 9★ monsters. We apologize that the timing of these adjustments are in stages and come after the implementation of the monsters themselves, but we hope you understand that this is a result of expediting the monster implementation.In order to diversify the lineup of quests, we are working to make it possible for Lagiacrus to appear in the Wounded Hollow, as well as other additions such as more hunts targeting packs of monsters. We are also implementing adjustments to improve gameplay convenience, such as preventing monsters from spontaneously destroying pop-up camps and resetting the cooldown for mantles upon beginning a quest.Finally, we can also assure you that any new monsters added in Title Update 3 will also feature 9★ difficulty quests. We hope you look forward to the new contents for Title Update 3, and that in the meantime you can enjoy the new additions from Ver. 1.021 to strengthen your equipment and collect Appraised Talismans in preparation for the challenging hunts ahead.Weapon Balance ChangesAs previously announced, we h...",1755008467,

So, let's get straight to it and hand over to Director Tokuda as he's got plenty to share with you, including upcoming content, performance and stability plans, weapon balancing and more!Mini Director's Letter - July 2025 Hello, hunters! This is Yuya Tokuda, director of Monster Hunter Wilds. Thank you to everyone who watched the Capcom Spotlight for news on Free Title Update 2. Free Title Update 2 - Major AdditionsThe second Free Title Update will feature two additional monsters, Lagiacrus and Seregios, as well as additional features such as Layered Weapons, and later in the summer, the release of Arch-Tempered Uth Duna.Everyone on the development team worked hard on Lagiacrus and Seregios to make them as enjoyable as possible. We hope you will enjoy seeing them in Free Title Update 2 when they are released.In this Director's Letter, I would like to introduce some of the details that we were not able to share with you in the Capcom Spotlight program. This includes improvements and adustments featured in Free Title Update 2, as well as further updates still to come. Free Title Update 2: Major Improvements and AdjustmentsThank you very much for sending us your feedback and requests via the survey form. In particular, we would like to thank you for your feedback on in four key areas: (1) Usability (UI/UX) Improvements, (2) Weapons Balance Adjustments, (3) Improved Game Stability (Steam version), and (4) More challenging hunts & further gear to chase. We are aware of these core feedback areas and are working to improve and adjust them. In Free Title Update 2, the main improvements and adjustments to (1) to (3) are planned to include the contents of the attached image. Please note that only includes a small amount of the improvements coming in Free Title Update 2. For more details and other details, please visit the website to read the full update notes.We will continue to make improvements to (1) to (3) in future updates. Next, I'd like to focus on how we plan to introduce more challenging hunts, as well as more late and endgame gear pursuits to the game in future updates. Future Update PlansSo far, we have discussed what we will be addressing in the second Free Title Update, however we feel there are still many points of feedback and requests to address. In particular, expanding endgame content is a focus area for us in future updates. Here's a look at how we plan to expand the endgame content. Free Title Update 3 (end of September) In Free Title Update 3, a new level of quest difficulty will be added, which will feature their own unique rewards. Hunters can use these rewards for a new Talisman crafting system, which can be assigned various skills at random. The new Talismans can be assigned a wide variety of skills, including those exclusive to Weapons and Armor, and will also be randomly assigned slots for decorations as well. We believe this system will broaded the range of builds, and create a gameplay loop that encourages players to equip themselves to take on the game's toughest challenges. We will announce information on the main features of Free Title Update 3 separately at a later date, so please look out for more information in the future!Free Title Update 4 (this winter)Free Title Update 4 is scheduled to be released this winter.This update will include a new monster as well as more challenging elements.We are considering ways to ensure that the Artian weapons you have already forged will remain valuable, so we hope you will continue to forge and strengthen your Artian weapons while waiting for more info on Free Title Update 4 in the future.

Title Updates, excluding bug fixes and other updates, will be implemented every few months, as with the first and second updates.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has played our game. As previously announced, the Ver. 1.011 update is planned to release on May 28, bringing an abundance of new features and changes to the game including a collaboration with Street Fighter 6. With Ver. 1.011, Title Update 2 and subsequent title updates, we want to provide more great content for you to enjoy as well as make various adjustments to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more fun to play. I hope you'll check out each update as it's released. Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration This special collaboration features equipment that will prepare you for any fight from the wilds to the streets, as well as a new challenger to the game: Akuma! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/bb5ef3fe3dba66628f206d3fb461c14564c5db51.jpg Included in the collaboration equipment are the Akuma full armor set and Akuma layered armor. When you have either equipped, three items will be added to the Item Bar - Assisted Combo: Akuma, Drive Impact, and Gou Hadoken. Note: The full armor set grants extra bonuses to these Akuma attacks! Now I'd like to go into a little more detail about Assisted Combo: Akuma and Drive Impact. Assisted Combo: Akuma This attack can be selected from the Item Bar consecutively to pull off a combo. When performing a combo, you can press or to activate different moves! Drive Impact Your Drive Gauge fills over time, and once it's full, a Drive Impact can be performed. Drive Impacts can be activated by selecting the move in the Item Bar, or by holding then pressing during a combo. When Akuma's full armor set is equipped, this move will gain an offset effect, and hitting a monster's wound or weak point will activate the Shun Goku Satsu attack that will gain stun properties. Used skilfully, these actions can be used to slay even the more difficult monsters in the game!

This will give players options for hunting 8★ tempered monsters other than Arkveld. Note: The above tempered monsters will still be available to hunt at 7★ difficulty. Each of these monsters have had various behind-the-scenes adjustments to make them more resilient, such as increased health, resistance to wounding, and tweaks to multiplayer scaling. Tempered Gore Magala (8★) is expected to provide a particularly tough challenge to even the best of hunters. Face this formidable beast at your own risk! Ver. 1.011 also features numerous improvements to quests. Higher-difficulty quests will now appear more frequently as your HR increases. Also, both the spawn rate of quests with multiple monsters and the appearance rate of tempered monsters with higher strength ratings have been increased. Title Update 2 In Title Update 2, set to release this summer, new monsters will be introduced into the wilds. Similar to Title Update 1, new tempered monsters (8★) as well a new Arch-tempered monster will make an appearance, so players should prepare for hunts that are more challenging than ever before. Furthermore, even stronger monsters are also planned to be added in later updates.

Also, certain aspects for Gunlance Artian weapons have been increased. While some weapons have had certain parameters adjusted downward, other parameters have been adjusted upwards, and viewed in totality I think you will find that all weapon types have had their possibilities expanded, so I encourage you to give them a try for yourself once the update is out. For further details about these adjustments, please view the update summary. Title Update 2 Also, the Hammer is planned to receive various improvements in Title Update 2 in addition to the adjustments made in this update, including the addition of offset effects for certain attacks and the addition of a follow-up attack upon a successful offset. Other weapons will also receive changes in Title Update 2 such as the Dual Blades. Note: Weapons will continue to receive changes in future updates.
