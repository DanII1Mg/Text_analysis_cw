3167020,Apology Statement Regarding Recent MOD Incident,"First and foremost, we would like to offer our sincerest apologies. Our response and handling of the recent issues surrounding certain MODs were neither timely nor appropriate.We recently received multiple player reports indicating that \Scav模式 1.8.0]​ (MOD ID: 3600714295) contained abnormal code, which prevented some players from launching the game. Following a thorough review, we have determined that this MOD violates our Creation Guidelines. To safeguard the normal gameplay experience for all players, we have taken action to ban this MOD.We also wish to address this matter with full transparency: Our response in identifying and handling this issue was not prompt, leading to a negative experience for affected players. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this has caused.To prevent such incidents in the future, we will commit to investigating any reports of MODs containing malicious code or exhibiting harmful behavior towards players within 3 business days. Upon verification, immediate action will be taken. We must acknowledge that we do not possess the capability for pre-release review of MODs; therefore, we genuinely rely on the vigilance and assistance of our community. If you encounter any related issues, please report them promptly through our Discord server or duckov2025@gmail.com. Furthermore, we have revised and strengthened our MOD Guide. All development, publication, and use of MODs must adhere to our Community Guidelines and the relevant Steam Workshop rules. Any MOD proven to harm normal gameplay, save data security, or community order will be permanently removed in accordance with our policies.Regarding our team's initial, informal communication with the MOD creator involved, we have come to understand that our internal decision—driven by a desire to ""minimize the impact on players who enjoyed this MOD""—to attempt a low-key, informal resolution at the onset of this incident was fundamentally flawed.We must acknowledge that this approach constituted a serious error in judgment. It compromised our stated principle of ""zero tolerance"" for malicious code and has disappointed the trust players placed in us. This is also unfair to the MOD developers who have always adhered to the community guidelines in their creative work. For this, we apologize once again.To the Escape from Duckovcommunity, all our users and MOD creators are valued members and deserve our utmost respect. We aspire to work together with all players and creators to maintain a positive environment for communication and discussion. We expect that any issues we face can be addressed through rational and respectful dialogue. We remain committed to upholding community standards and striving to ensure a safe, friendly, and smooth experience for everyone, both in-game and within our community.We extend our sincerest apologies once more and thank you for your understanding and continued support.Escape from Duckov Publishing Team",1765715206,"['enable_steam_china', 'workshop']"

There are rare occasions when fanfiction can take off and hit the mainstream, though, matching (or, in especially uncommon occurrences, surpassing) their inspirators. By all accounts, <strong>Escape From Duckov</strong> is a great game in its own right. The gameplay is a world away from Tarkov, which clearly inspired its name, but players are still flocking to get a piece of its duck-on-duck action. Is it because of the name?

It’s been almost a full year since our first test, and we’re beyond excited to finally release the full game. 🎮✨First and foremost — thank you. To everyone who joined our tests, followed our journey, shared feedback, or just hung out with us in Discord — you made this possible. We truly believe that player feedback is the heartbeat of game development. You didn’t just play the game… you helped shape it.When we talk about how we design Duckov, here’s how I always put it: ""About 50% of the game comes from our vision… but the other 50%? That’s all you.""And honestly? Some of the best ideas came from you guys. Remember early on when defeated enemies just turned into a box? Well, tons of you joked: “What if they turned into roast ducks instead? That’d be brutal!” We lost it. 😆 And guess what? You’re now roasting ducks in-game. (You’re welcome.).We also noticed some mixed feelings about game difficulty, so in the full release, we’ve added: ✅ Multiple difficulty modes ✅ A fully customizable difficulty option Because we want as many players as possible to have fun — whether you’re here for chill looting or hardcore survival.We saw the memes. “Launching during Oct 1–7? Just trying to get some holidays, huh?” Look, we might’ve joked about it too… but truthfully? We’re a little nervous about this launch. So we’re pouring all our energy into polishing, refining, and squashing as many bugs as possible. (And yeah… we’ve been working overtime. hhhh 😅)This release isn’t the finish line — it’s just the starting line. We’re already planning more free content updates, and we’re listening closely to everything you share. Your feedback doesn’t stop here — it fuels everything we do next.Thank you for flying with us. We couldn’t have done it without you. Let’s keep making Duckov even more awesome — together. 🕊️💙Cheers,Jeff Producer, Escape from Duckov",1760584615,['enable_steam_china']

3167020,Dev Diary 🦆丨Release Date Announced!,"It’s been almost a month since the demo closed, and the most frequent question we’ve heard is: ""When is the game actually coming out?"" (And of course, many passionate players have already answered: “Soon!”) Well, today we can finally say— October 16th is the day we’re serving it up hot for you all!During the last demo test, we received an overwhelming amount of feedback from you wonderful folks who tried the game. A huge, heartfelt thank you for your support!! Here’s what we’ve improved based on your input: 1. Difficulty – Now Fully Customizable(Because everyone’s playstyle is different—some love a challenge, others just want to loot in peace.) Since players come from varied gaming backgrounds, perceptions of difficulty vary widely. So in the full release, we’re introducing: Custom Difficulty Settings! Adjust enemy HP, player damage taken, item drop rates, and more—tailor your perfect ""Duckov"" world and scavenge to your heart’s content, quack-quack!2. New Player Guidance – Smoother First Steps(No more confusion for newcomers—now even if you’re new to this genre, you’ll get the hang of it fast.) Previously, players unfamiliar with this type of game sometimes struggled at first. In the full version, we’ve added a dedicated tutorial area and refined our guidance—so even first-timers can dive into the thrill of ""loot, fight, extract"" without a hitch. 3. Inventory – More Space, Better Organization(For all you hoarder-types out there—we heard you loud and clear: ""Not enough bags!"" Some players felt the backpack was too small, storage limited, and sorting a hassle. In the full release, we’re boosting stack limits for more item types, expanding backpack capacity, and increasing carry weight. The warehouse also gets a size upgrade—hoarding just got happier, quack-quack!Plus: New inventory features like item locking and one-click sorting make looting smoother than ever! 4. Controls – Wheel Scrolling & Side-Button Bindings Added(Remember those early demo requests? Yep, we delivered back in June.) The most common control requests (mouse wheel swapping and side-button bindings) were updated way back in June. 5. Black Market – Faster Refreshes, More Drops(No more waiting forever for the good stuff.) Late in the demo, many of you complained about the long refresh timers for the black market. In the full release, we’ve upgraded the system—more refreshes, shorter cooldowns, and better rewards. Now you can farm those rare items like a pro. 6. Multiplayer, Controller & Console Support(Big ask, but not forgotten.) Many of you asked about multiplayer, controller support, and console versions. These aren’t in the initial launch, as Duckov was originally designed for keyboard & mouse. Adapting controllers and consoles requires significant work, and our team is currently focused on polishing new content. But don’t worry—we’ll seriously evaluate post-launch feasibility. Stay tuned! 7. More Content? Oh, We’ve Got You Covered.(“Too little to play?” Not anymore. New maps? Weapons? Skills? NPCs? Check, check, and check.) Some of you said: ""Not enough content!"" Well, guess what? The full release has all that—and more. (Saw something weird and high-tech in the PV? Some very tech-bro looking facilities? We’ll say no more… for now.) The full version holds even more surprises waiting to be uncovered. 8. Tons of Bug Fixes & Quality-of-Life Upgrades(We’ve been hard at work behind the scenes.) Over the past few months, the team has been rigorously playtesting, fine-tuning numbers, and polishing every detail. Our goal? For you to experience pure, unfiltered fun in Duckov—and for you to genuinely think, “Damn, this is a great game.” Fun is the #1 priority. Quack-quack-quack!!

3167020,Answers to Some Questions Everyone is Concerned About,"Recently, besides receiving a lot of suggestions from everyone, we’ve also encountered many issues that players have faced. I’ve compiled some of the most common questions here for everyone to check out. I used translation software, so if anything is unclear, please leave a comment and let me know! About Basic Game Questions Q1: I really want to play with my friends! Does the game include a multiplayer mode? A: Duckov is a single-player game and does not include multiplayer features. Q2: Can I play it on my phone? A: There are currently no plans to release it on mobile platforms... Q3: Does the game support controllers? A: Not at the moment. Q4: Will it support MAC computers? A: The current DEMO version does not support MAC, but the full release will! Q5: Does the game support cloud saves? A: The DEMO version does not support cloud saves, but the full version will. Also, Steam achievements will only be available in the full version. Q6: Will there be a Steam Workshop? A: This is still undecided. We’ll need to wait until the core development is complete before making a decision. About Major Bugs in This Test Q1: Sometimes, the GPU usage is too high. A: In the future, we’ll add an FPS cap setting. Currently, the cap is 144 FPS, which does put a high load on the GPU. We’ll also add more graphics settings to meet the needs of more players. Q2: Why is my game screen purple? A: Based on the information we’ve gathered, it’s likely because the game does not support integrated graphics cards. (orz) Q3: If there’s a power outage or crash during gameplay, the save file will be lost. A: QAQ First of all, we sincerely apologize for this issue. We’ve received multiple reports about this problem, and unfortunately, we currently cannot fix it. We’ve roughly identified the cause of the bug and will resolve it in the next test! Q4: Strange map glitches and invisible walls. A: Aaaah, please report these to us! We’ll fix them as soon as possible! (orz) About Future Plans Q1: When will we be able to play next? A: After this playtest ends, we’ll adjust the game based on the feedback we’ve received. We’ll open another test during the Steam Next Fest in June! In terms of content, the next DEMO won’t include new maps, but we’ll optimize the tutorial, improve the quest experience, and address other frequently reported issues. Everything will be optimized!! Around June, we’ll also finalize a release date for the full game. We’ll definitely deliver it this year! Q2: What will the business model be like? How much will it cost? A: Duckov will be a one-time purchase game with no in-game purchases. The exact price hasn’t been decided yet, but we’ll respect and consider everyone’s suggestions. Q3: Will the current DEMO save files be compatible with the full version? A: Actually, we can’t deliberately delete your save files (since they’re stored locally for single-player games). However, because we’ve updated the game, old save files might trigger unexpected bugs. Additionally, in the new version, we’ll update quests, optimize the early-game experience, adjust enemy and weapon stats, add official Steam achievements, and make a series of other adjustments. Therefore, we recommend starting a new save file when the full game is released.",1739519249,
3167020,Announcement of the End of the DEMO Test,"Since the DEMO was released on January 24, over 100,000 people have played it and added us to their wishlists! We’ve communicated with players on various platforms and received countless suggestions and feedback from everyone. We are truly honored to have received so much love from all of you! Thank you so much, everyone! (Ducky bows deeply.) Here’s a reminder for all players: We will close the game DEMO at February 17. After that, you will no longer be able to download or launch the DEMO version. Our team is small, so we can’t always keep an eye on the online situation. At the same time, we need some time to continue creating more game content, fixing bugs, and optimizing areas where the experience isn’t great. Please give us a little more time! The next public DEMO test is expected to be during the Steam Next Fest in June. We hope to see you all there!

3167020,"""Escape from Duckov"" STEAM Wishlist Reaches 100,000!!!","I’ve been thinking about writing a thank-you letter to express my thoughts, hoping you won’t laugh at me. We started preparing for the Steam release around mid-December, and at first, we were really nervous. Every day was filled with endless bug fixes. Then we received the notice that we’d be opening the DEMO during China’s holiday period, which was a sudden decision. To be honest, our small team was quite anxious, constantly making adjustments. Mr. Jeff often joked, “Every build of this game feels like a different one!” Even during the holidays, we kept searching for feedback daily, afraid we might miss something. Over the past few days, we’ve received messages from players around the world. Then, just recently, when I checked the backend, I was surprised to find that 100,000 people have added our game to their wishlist!!! I sincerely thank everyone for their support! We hope that on the day of the official release, we can truly live up to everyone’s expectations! Additionally, as a token of our appreciation, we’ve decided to extend the test DEMO period by one more week. The new closing time for the DEMO is 9:00 PM UTC on February 16, 2025, If you haven’t had enough fun yet, feel free to continue grinding for another week! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45342384/2d2915e4850674ab7e2ae2b14533e7ff99f678b5.png",1739010795,
