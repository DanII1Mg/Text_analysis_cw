346110,Snail Games apologizes for Ark Aquatica DLC as update breaks the survival game,"<strong>Ark: Aquatica</strong> was supposed to be a special celebration of Studio Wildcard's original survival game, but it's been met with a hugely negative response as many players find their saves unplayable, settings reset, and mod compatibility broken.

Expect more community posts to continue!As a reminder, the community has its own Discord server linked here, for all things ARK: Aquatica community wise, we will keep a close eye on both the Discord server and the ARK Survival Evolved community hub on Steam!Today's post will be led off with FOUR creature dossiers, reveals of the unique biomes and TWO unique items in the DLC.Creature Dossier reveals:TiktaalikTiktaalik Roseae""Even with its deficits, the Tiktaalik persists. It flees in danger, but not with exceptional speed. Its largest defense is its ability to hide in place. Saying it uses camouflage is generous. The act of covering its eyes seems to trick any hostile creature into leaving it alone.""Initially appearing to be fearful then turning playful, the Tiktaalik will look to find a playmate and as you come across these cute creatures in the wild, don't expect them to be masters at hiding.OnchopristisOnchopristis serratmatus""This fish is both creature and tool to anyone brave enough to master them. Taming requires force and some agility to avoid their razor sharp, exposed teeth. These creatures won’t be ridden bareback. With a saddle, you can travel the waters with a chainsaw carving your path.""Obviously intimidating yet purposeful, a creature that requires effort to tame but can become a great asset, one that will put up a good fight. Keep your distance unless you dare!Mantis ShrimpOdontodactylus concussus""They are protective of their homes and the eggs of their offspring. Yet they are not impossible to reason with. A typical peace offering is not effective as it is clear to me that the wild Mantis Shrimp has a deep sense of pride. It will not be handfed. They demand respect and I find it easy to give.""A tame that can also be a loyal assistant, these will be worth the respect they demand with their utility. Watch your limbs and extremities with this one.MonodonMonodon magicosceros""Monodons appear to be a typical aquatic animal. They swim where simple fish can be found in abundance. To gain their loyalty, you must hop on to the back of this wild animal and prove you can handle it.""The legend come to life, set to be one of the best companions in the expansion. For transporation, utility and defense, seeking these creatures may prove essential.Check out the listed creatures and teaser of other creatures in the video below:Revealing the 5 Unique Biomes in Aquatica:In ARK: Aquatica, there will be 5 Unique Biomes and sub-biomes in between that survivors will explore for secrets and treasures while also searching for biome-specific creatures to tame.The 5 biomes are as follows: Shallows Crystal Caverns Boiling Sea Depths Abyss Pictured here is the Shallows biome. the introductory biome in the world of Aquatica. A gorgeous and friendly biome teeming with colorful corals, happy beasts, and mystical plants that somehow allow humans to breathe underwater.Pictured here is the opposite end of the biome spectrum, the Abyss, residing below the Depths, this biome looks like another world at the bottom of the ocean. Aquatic in nature but somehow twisted, like it doesn't quite belong in this reality.While we have only described 2 of the 5 unique biomes, we hope that the players enjoy and explore all 5 biomes and also the sub-biomes in between.Bonus: Two unique items in AquaticaTwo amazing tools to aid your underwater journey, the Tek Trident and the Seafin Glider Suit will be essential items in this expansion!With more creature reveals and items on the way, we hope that not only the community remains excited but also looking forward to seeing and meeting these creatures upon release.Thanks for waiting!

It has the physical appearance of a salamander, yet is the size of a domesticated dog. It also has the personality to match. The name Mudpuppy seems fitting.""Definitely a creature that you will come across early... Mudpuppies are tamable creatures that will be a reliable, companion-like tame that will not only help you survive on land, but also underwater.Tridacna Tridacna tenanmalus""This giant clam is more of a rock than an animal. Like a rock, the Tridacna remains in its place. If you are not careful, you can end up trapped in its maw. If you do not provoke it, these are more of an annoyance than a threat.""Dangerous yet high yield, the Tridacna provides you with an option for a quick grab of pearls or a longer term investment to yield more pearls over time.With more creature reveals and items on the way, we hope that not only the community remains excited but also looking forward to seeing and meeting these creatures upon release.

346110,ARK: Aquatica Release Date Announcement!,"Welcome to Aquatica, the first expansion of ARK’s boundaries into the deep sea.Survivors, are you ready to take on an all-new challenge in the depths? Launching on July 15, ARK: Aquatica arrives as a special ARK: Survival Evolved DLC to celebrate the franchise’s 10th anniversary.“Aquatica” is a sunken ARK lying within a vast underwater ecosystem. Survivors will be pushed to their limits as they face unprecedented challenges: crushing deep-sea pressure, powerful currents, drastic environmental shifts, and strange life forms lurking in the abyss.Aquatica introduces five unique deep-sea biomes, born from ARK’s system malfunctions and elemental mutations. Together, they form a sprawling underwater labyrinth. These zones exist at varying depths, and what seems like the ocean floor may, in fact, be the surface of yet another deeper zone.As you venture further into the abyss, everything changes with the depth: water pressure constantly reminds you of the ocean’s deadly embrace. With increasing pressure and diminishing light, each biome showcases distinct vegetation and aquatic life, while powerful underwater currents introduce entirely new challenges.The further survivors descend into the ocean, the more its ultimate secrets and dangers will be revealed. The harsh environment has bred unimaginable creatures, and the extreme conditions like oxygen scarcity, crushing pressure, and buoyancy shifts make every step of exploration a true test of survival.But worry not. 21 brand-new aquatic creatures await in this oceanic frontier. Some will test your strength, while many others may become your best companions. Stay tuned for more details about the creatures of ARK: Aquatica in upcoming updates.

346110,Ark Survival Ascended devs give three reasons why so many have stuck with ASE,"Alongside the likes of Rust, Valheim, and Subnautica, Ark has established itself as one of the biggest players in the survival game space. <strong>Ark Survival Evolved</strong> is now ten years old, and still boasts healthy player counts to this day. The same can be said for its Unreal Engine 5 remaster, <strong>Ark Survival Ascended</strong>, which is busy enhancing ASE's vast library of content expansions and creating original ones in the process. An ambitious sequel, Ark 2, is also in the works. There's even a star-studded Ark animated series. While that all sounds remarkably positive, it's safe to say that there have been trying times too. In an exclusive interview with PCGamesN, two of the co-founders of Studio Wildcard - Jesse Rapczak and Jeremy Stieglitz - reflect on the last decade of Ark, the reasons why swathes of players are yet to shift over to Survival Ascended, and their favorite Ark expansion of the last ten years. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-ascended/studio-wildcard-interview-survival-evolved"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-ascended/forced-frame-generation"">Ark Survival Ascended forces AMD Radeon gaming GPUs to use FSR frame gen</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-ascended/engine-upgrade-astraeos-map-expansion"">Ark Survival Ascended gets a performance boost and a big map expansion</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-ascended/mods"">The 14 best Ark Survival Ascended mods</a> ",1751035194,

Bad enough that original developers <a href=""https://x.com/survivetheark/status/1901846059933942125"">Studio Wildcard hastily and firmly distanced themselves</a> from the project, reiterating that their focus was on <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended"">ARK: Survival Ascended</a> and <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2"">Ark 2</a>. If I had to sum up the trailer in a single word, I would attempt to write that word out with four-day old regurgitated Alphabetti spaghetti, invariably failing to give voice to my flailing disgust before retiring to the corner to fart at god. This would still take approximately fourteen times more effort than whoever got paid to write ""like the ocean, but worse"" into their phone to tease out the following results. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/six-armed-octopuses-and-other-abyssal-horrors-from-ark-survival-evolveds-new-ai-slop-trailer"">Read more</a> ",1742463546,

Your exuberance, sense of community, and the vivid tapestry of experiences you've woven in the world of ARK: Survival Evolved have truly brought our creation to life. You’re the beating heart of our “little” dinosaur game. Some might consider the upcoming transition a bittersweet occasion punctuated by a sense of loss and sadness. We feel otherwise. Unofficial ASE is in great hands. Yours. But, as one chapter concludes, another unfolds – and again our stories will mix with yours to create something greater than the sum of two parts. Remember, it's not farewell, it’s “see you real soon” with more ASA news, reveals, gameplay and, ultimately, the launch of ARK: Survival Ascended near the end of October! So, Survivors, thank you for eight incredible years and here’s to many more. With heartfelt gratitude and dino-sized enthusiasm, The Studio Wildcard Team {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/edf522aa315b4137691e2c1e2dc2bb22e8bd2703.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/9c633e5613d43d28ca422185d4b68fc55583c727.jpg Download in full resolution {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/5d6ac0eb2cd10143c7bb2d128f576fda5d797502.png Species: Shastasaurus carmentellum Time: Late Triassic Diet: Carnivore Temperament: Curious {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/6030b873c18c32a4466d131a1dc8ba2ef778eb7a.png This odd variant of Shastasaurus seems as curious about humans as its distant relative Ichthyosaur. It sure got my attention when one of these sea monsters swam up to have a look at me! Luckily, its bulk turns out to be worse than its bite. Shastasaurus has weaponized the ultrasonic chirps it uses for echolocation. It can focus those sounds into a tight cone that disorients prey, or widen the effect to blast apart a school of fish in a concussive wave. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/96fd2d846640f4b76e7df293686ef909d6c71588.png Taming a Shastasaurus was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I brought  along some Ichthyosaur pals to entertain their larger cousin while I scraped some of its itchy barnacles off with a sickle. From then on, I had a gigantic escort in deep water. Some tribes manage to kit out their finny friend with a periscope, torpedo bays, and even a cargo hold… Those Shastasaurs end up looking like something from the old kids’ cartoon with cavemen who turned dinos into cars and submarines! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/c678b18984329d30c804312592d91d84a6b3eeeb.png ​ Hey Survivors! We’re going to recap some of the information we’ve shared regarding ARK: Survival Ascended in this crunch, along with touching on some topics that haven’t been covered and expanding on some that have! If you’ve been following along for the last few months, you might already know some of this information, but we’ve seen a lot of questions lately, so let’s start with the basics before diving into some of the more frequently asked questions from the community. IF YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT ASA, FEEL FREE TO SKIP THIS BIT :-)... What is ASA? ARK: Survival Ascended (ASA) is a next-generation remake of our beloved ARK: Survival Evolved, harnessing the power of Unreal Engine 5. When is it launching? The launch is just around the corner! We’ll reveal the launch trailer screenshots and set the game live near the end of October. Where can you play it? You’ll be able to play ARK: Survival Ascended on Xbox Series S/X, PlayStation 5, and PC (Windows/Steam). Why are you doing it? There are various reasons we’ve decided to take this approach. One is to refine the development team’s skills on UE5 and how far it can be pushed for next-generation titles (ARK 2).. Another factor is for business reasons. Developing a next-generation sequel while no longer releasing paid expansion packs has proven difficult for our Studio’s long-term survival, so we need to continue generating revenue while we develop ARK 2. And finally, the ultimate reason: whereas ARK2 is being designed as a Souls-like adventure, we want to provide the community with an evergreen classic-ARK experience, one that can continue to grow over time on a cleaned-up code base, leveraging new technological advancements not only in the industry but also what we’ve been working on with the ARK Franchise as a creative whole. How are you leveraging the new technology? Another question that could result in quite a mouthful of a response, so we’ll try to keep it simple. Here’s what’ll be coming with ASA: ARK’s codebase has been rewritten, and its artwork recreated by hand to take full advantage of Unreal Engine 5, including its Lumen and Nanite systems. Advanced graphics features such as dynamic water (Custom FluidNinja integration), complete interactive physical foliage, and more systems to create a beautiful, immersive, next-generation experience.

Despite its aberrant size, Yi ling is still somehow light enough to cling to walls and it can even glide short distances. It’s light on its feet as well, able to dodge attacks on the run. I’m glad Yi seems to prefer prey smaller than itself, because it can eject a spray of barbed feathers at an unhappy target before darting in to rip them back out. Its unique firepower may expose Yi in the short term, but its protective plumage regrows fast. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/05ffcc62e054b4e83903dd6acabebca1edd4b8a7.png A tamed Yi makes for an excellent -- if precarious -- hunting mount.

If you are able to play with your friends, joining a session is a straightforward process, as long as you don't want to host a dedicated server, so you can hop on with your friends in almost no time. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark/crossplay-cross-platform"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-evolved/best-ark-servers"">The best Ark servers 2023</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-evolved/the-best-ark-survival-evolved-mods"">The best Ark mods 2023</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-survival-ascended/delay-early-access"">Ark remaster delayed, now early access, but cheaper</a> ",1690552650,

Gigantoraptor may be fiercely protective of its brood, but it’s much more of a caregiver than a fighter. Don’t get me wrong -- this theropod will use its sharp claws and surprising speed to defend its young when threatened. But Gigantoraptor has a soft heart for young ones -- it’ll even take in the orphaned babies of rival species. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/61ac09b089d4fdf3bb3dcc77983196495135f302.png Now for the bad news: to my knowledge, no one’s been able to figure out how to tame an adult Gigantoraptor – its unique disposition seems resistant to behavioral conditioning. However, Survivors bolder than me were able to sneak into nests to win the trust of their young, and they claim that reward is well worth the risk. Once matured to adulthood, your tamed Gigantoraptor will happily look after any of your tribe’s young creatures, nurturing them and teaching them how to fight. It can even use its call to help you find orphaned baby animals out in the wild. If you bring those orphans home, then your Gigantoraptor will happily add them to its brood. Gigantoraptor forms an inseparable bond with its young charges. Bring them into a fight together and they will defend each other, and your tribe, far more effectively than when apart. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/feed288210f9afe94f4877f2ef6d7071103328f2.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/9f559f4dc2a443db312d5909a2f1c7ccc0bce101.png The competition is reaching its boiling point as we near the end of the Community Creature Vote.

We’ve found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2, but at the same time, it is incredibly exciting. We’re discovering new ways each day to push the technology to the next level; combined with the work needed to support a fully cross-platform-moddable game ecosystem on consoles and PC, it’s clear that we’ll need a bit more time. We’ve also decided to separate the release date of The Island and Scorched Earth. With what we’ve learned about remastering The Island from the ground-up, it wouldn’t be feasible to complete Scorched Earth to a standard we’re happy with. So for now, we’re going to plan that Scorched Earth will be coming to ASA in December this year, Ragnarok and Aberration will follow in Q1 2024, and the rest of the maps beyond then. Given the news: ARK: Survival Ascended will now be launching at an Early Access price point of $44.99 with a launch-discount bringing it to $39.99. We had initially planned to ship with more content on Day One, but that won’t be happening, so we’re adjusting the launch price accordingly. We know you really want to get your hands on ASA, and we appreciate that support and enthusiasm. We’re going to do our best to work hard to make sure that we can deliver a tremendous next-gen ARK experience that meets both your expectations and our own. That covers the big news; we know there’s still a fair bit of time between now and the launch, so hang in there; it’ll be worth the wait! In the meantime, here are some answers to questions we’ve seen come up over the last few weeks as well as address some new points. When will we see gameplay? We know you’re excited, curious, and skeptical; we understand. Our plan is to show gameplay close to the launch of ASA, as that’ll be when it’s completely ready and best represent the final product, so you’ll have to stay tuned until then. Is there going to be a change to the date when ARK:SE’s Official Network comes offline? We’re now planning on shutting down the Official Network on September 30th, given the slight delay in the launch of the game. When will we be able to access our save files? We’re currently working with Nitrado to make sure that the save files system works, and we’ll be providing instructions on how you can get them when they’re available. Our intention is to take multiple saves at different times, so you can choose which is most relevant to you. With Scorched Earth being delayed, will there still be server transfers? We won’t be supporting Server Transfers at the launch of ARK: Survival Ascended; this feature will become enabled when Scorched Earth releases in December. How long should we expect the title to be in ‘Early Access’? ARK: Survival Ascended will leave Early Access in late 2024 once all the content has finished its next-generation remastering. Are there going to be any changes to the release order of certain content? Generally, we will keep the canonical maps released in the same order. We may make some adjustments with some of the non-cannon maps and release them sooner, but that honestly depends more on our pipeline, so we’ll announce them accordingly. Will we be seeing more ASA concepts? Yep! We intend to keep showing you guys progress on the visual changes between ARK:SE and ASA in the lead-up to the game's launch. What about creature votes? They’ll be continuing to run! In fact, the team has been working on the design for the Gigantoraptor from a conceptual point of view, as well as the actual gameplay mechanics, and we can’t wait to show that to you in the weeks ahead! As always, we're incredibly grateful for your ongoing support and passion for the franchise.

There’s something out here that looks like Fasolasuchus, if those proto-crocs could swim through sand like water… These beasts might pop up suddenly to ambush you, or swim around you fast enough to catch you in a sand-whirlpool. I can't stress enough how dangerous this deathtrap can be! Plus their tails are strong enough to whip up sand to blind predators and prey alike. If you can help it, I recommend staying clear of those spikes. I think they’ve got acid glands at the base of their spiny fins, and in their mouths as well. Their caustic bite seems to melt through the thickest hide. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/96fd2d846640f4b76e7df293686ef909d6c71588.png One of these monster sand-swimmers would make a great mount, but good luck slowing down something that can shrug off most narcotics. You could try softening one up with explosives, grabbing a spike, and steering it into a rock… But you’d have to be a bit mental to try. I imagine the adrenaline junkies able to tame a Fasolasuchus would earn themselves a formidable ride through these scorching sands. They seem to have adapted to fighting larger prey, so I'd advise any faso-rider to steer clear of packs of smaller creatures that can swarm over its defenses. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/4ad727e9440c6efc04a30f1de4b202f8d3253bdf.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/8fe7af473617302f550d61da1c51be4504e6cf11.jpg It's a heated race to close out the Community Creature Vote and determine which entry will be crowned the winner!

346110,Best Ark dinos to tame,"<strong>There are loads of Ark dinos to tame, and knowing exactly which ones to prioritize isn't easy.</strong> While you won't be recreating your dinosaur theme park - we all know how that went the first time around - deciding between a T-Rex or a Carnotaurus, a Quetzal or a Doedicurus, or even non-dinosaur creatures like the Mammoth or Beelzebufo can be difficult. That's where we come in. This list of the ten best Ark dinos to tame will help guide your efforts with tips for taming and capturing each one. We've considered multiple aspects of each dino when putting together this list, including their utility, base stats, and how easy they are to tame generally, so this is especially useful for any beginners.

I know I'm right about this. Take this monster bug I'm calling 'Rhyniognatha antiquagenitor' -- big enough to headline a horror flick, but still light enough to fly and skate across water. Would you believe it also makes a weirdly useful, quick-hardening resin with a variety of uses? It can thicken up its shell for a defensive boost, spray hard bullet-like globs, or squirt soft globs that harden on impact to gum up incoming predators! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/96fd2d846640f4b76e7df293686ef909d6c71588.png These overgrown earwigs are just what you need to level up your tribe's aerial defenses! And here's a tip: if you crush up the right Arthropleura, you'll get an enzyme that makes Rhyniognatha glue as TEK-disruptive as Dinopithecus dung. Plus this bug can glue itself to creatures or cargo and carry things around your base! That said, Rhyniognatha-raising isn't for the squeamish... Their males have a pheromone that invites egg-laying females to use them as hosts. Harvest that pheromone, and you can mark any creature for the female to lay her eggs on. The host then incubates a new generation of larvae that can reap its best traits in the process. If some poor beast gets eggs laid on it by accident, you might still be able to save it by popping it in a cryopod and freezing out the larvae. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/16909bcdf8c6ec7821ba65d996b18b45160cfe01.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/fbaee4e2bf044a6e46021d2886be59de0f1de813.jpg The community creature submissions are still underway!

346110,"Following backlash, Ark remaster is now more expensive, old servers still being shutdown","After some fan backlash over how the <strong>Ark: Survival Evolved</strong> remaster is being handled, <strong>Studio Wildcard</strong> has responded by… making it more expensive. Last week, Studio Wildcard made a couple of big announcements related to the Ark series. The first one, that Ark 2 has been <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/ark-2-delayed-to-2024-for-the-betterment-of-the-final-product-and-the-teams-well-being"">delayed into 2024</a>, is completely unsurprising, as we have seen literally nothing of the game so far. The second one was a little more surprising though, as the studio announced that Ark: Survival Evolved is getting a big remaster called <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/ark-survival-evolved-servers-going-offline-for-ark-survival-ascended"">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, as well as the fact that Survival Evolved's servers are getting shut down, meaning players would have to buy the remaster. Fans didn't like this much, so obviously Studio Wildcard's solution was to make it more expensive. To further explain, in the announcement Wildcard revealed that if you want to play the game on Xbox or PC, you had to buy a bundle which also contains the upcoming second game for $49.99 (on PS5 you could buy just Survival Ascended for $39.99). On top of that players would have to buy upcoming expansion packs. Now, in a <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/346110/view/3707066558319824087?l=english"">new post</a> from Wildcard, apparently none of this is the case. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/ark-survival-evolved-ascended-more-expensive"">Read more</a> ",1681055858,
346110,"Community Crunch 356: ARK Roadmap Update, Rhyniognatha Concept, and More!","{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8729288/59179a29f99021c2f2f10438d294d27c3856d037.png Hey Survivors, We appreciate your patience as we digested the feedback and consulted with our partners to revise our upcoming plans. As always, we’re very grateful to have such a passionate player base, and we hear and understand your concerns. We've decided to make some changes and provide additional information as to why we’re taking this approach, so please bear with us as we address some points. Price Point and Bundle First things first, we are scrapping the ARK Respawned Bundle. Our intention behind this was to provide a package where you essentially got two products for the price of one. In hindsight, not the best move. Our bad; we recognize how combining ARK Survival Ascended with ARK 2 and requiring further DLC upgrades wasn’t optimal, especially since you wouldn’t be able to judge ARK 2 as no gameplay or content would be available yet. Here are our new plans: ARK: Survival Ascended will now be a standalone package released on every platform (PC Windows/Steam, Xbox Series S/X, and PlayStation 5) at $59.99. The package will include the following pieces of content built-in (not sold separately), with each remastered and altered for the next-generation: The Island (Released at Launch) Survival of the Fittest: The Island & Scorched Earth map variants (Released at Launch) Scorched Earth (Released at Launch) Aberration (Released by Q4 2023) Extinction (Released by Q1 2024) Genesis Part 1 (Released by Q1 2024) Genesis Part 2 (Released by Q2 2024) All the community-created maps are also to be released over time in 2024 (Fjordur, Ragnarok, The Center, Lost Island, Valguero, Crystal Isles) No longer a backward-compatible free update? Initially, when we had first considered doing an Unreal 5 upgrade, we planned just to port the Switch version of the game and undo the ‘graphical’ limitations required for that hardware. We weren’t going to maximize the potential of the new technology, we weren’t going to introduce new gameplay changes, and we weren’t going to make critical design changes that would have had an impact on existing save data. After carefully considering what would be the best outcome for those who enjoy ARK: Survival Evolved and would want to continue to enjoy it in the years to come, we decided that our initial plan would not be sufficient. We want to provide you with an evergreen classic ARK experience, one that can continue to grow over time on a cleaned-up code base, making use of the new technological advancements not only in the industry but also in what we are working on with ARK 2. We weren’t trying to mislead you with earlier comments; our plans and overall intentions changed. So you're probably asking, why don’t we make these upgrades to the original ARK: Survival Evolved (ASE)? Frankly, it would not be viable. Many of the changes we’re making in ARK: Survival Ascended will touch a lot of aspects of the game; it’ll invalidate save data, some mods may not be functional, some things may not play the same way as they did before, and we didn’t want to change that experience for those who prefer it or are unable to upgrade. This also impacted our decision to sunset the ASE Official Network offline on August 31st, shortly before the ASA launch. Despite ASE Officials representing the minority of players on ARK, it’s an invested and passionate group with attachments to their bases, tames, and characters, and seeing that go away can’t be easy. While we know it’s not the same, we hope making the saves available for unofficial use helps diminish the loss. Our reasoning behind the decision is that those servers are essentially based on old technology and require significant development resources and time for our teams to operate & maintain. In some cases, the issues aren’t as easily solvable without an overall upgrade. Additionally, we know that those resources could be better utilized on fundamentally new technology to further enhance the overall game experience for all players. ASE will still be available to play for those who choose to; that includes multiplayer through unofficial/player-hosted sessions, the endless amount of mods on the Steam workshop, and all the game content as you currently know it. All of that is going to remain, but after 8 years of development, we have to make the difficult decision of sunsetting ASE and the Official Network in order to provide that truly long-term and evergreen version of the game through ARK: Survival Ascended. We’ll be sending off ASE with one final content update for our 8th anniversary this June, releasing the fan-elected creature: Rhyniognatha!
