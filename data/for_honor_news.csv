We want to stay away from mechanics that prevent player actions or favors inaction. However, we didn't target Throws with these changes, so every Hero still has a way to deplete a low stamina opponent if the opportunity presents itself. As for the other exceptions, we will monitor their performance and adjust in the future if needed.KHATUN:Khatun can now follow a successful Deflect with Frightful Kick by pressing Guardbreak.Ultimate Authority Hit Recovery has been reduced from 700 to 600ms to leave Khatun frame advantaged on hit.Relentless Peace Hit Recovery has been reduced from 1700 to 1600ms to leave Khatun frame neutral on hit.\We want to address some of the main concerns Khatuns face without over-compensating and making the Hero too strong.First - Kathun will now be able to Frightful Kick from Deflect. This will give players a clear option against chain attacks with uninterruptible stance.Second - Ultimate Authority now ends with Khatun in frame advantage, allowing them to continue their offense after landing it. As for Restless Peace, it is now frame neutral (it used to leave Khatun at a disadvantage).With these changes, Khatuns should still think about which outcome they want without feeling too penalized for it.PIRATE:Cavalier Dance now only has 166ms parry window.The new parry window is from 400ms to 566ms (instead of 400 to 600)Note that the LAST frame before the hit was removed. Not the first one.Walk the Plank now only has 166ms parry window.The new parry window is from 566ms to 733ms (instead of 566 to 766)Note that the LAST frame before the hit was removed. Not the first one.\At the highest level, Cavalier Dance & Walk the Plank are not effective at opening the opponent's guard, as players can react to them (and their feints) earlier than expected. The goal behind this change is to test if this approach can resolve the issue. By removing the last frame of parry, it should make it an even playing field for players of all levels.If this change does not work, we will look at other avenues, such as polishing or reworking the animation.SHAOLIN:Sun Sweep no longer chains on Miss.Sun Sweep Miss Recovery has been reduced from 800 to 600ms.\Shaolin is overperforming. Sun Sweep should now be more risky to perform when not feinted. To compensate, the opponent won't be able to Dodge into Guardbreak as a punish.SHUGOKI:Headbutt (from Chain & Front Dodge) no longer chains on Miss.Headbutt (Front Dodge) Miss recovery has been reduced from 700ms to 600ms.\Shugoki is also overperforming. With this change, a good read by the opponent will allow them to go on offense instead of risking losing to the chain armor attacks. To compensate, the opponent won't be able to Dodge into Guardbreak as a punish.KYOSHIN:Light Finishers are no longer undodgeable.Light Finishers damage has been reduced from 16 to 14 damage.\Kyoshin is overperforming, more so at low levels. We reduced the damage on Light Finishers to be more in line with the rest of the cast. In addition, by removing the undodgeable property on Light Finishers, Kyoshin's will have to rely more on Heavy Finishers to prevent opponents from dodging. This will slow the pace of the fight slightly and reduce the incentive to rely only on quick Light attacks.SHAMAN:Improved the trajectory of numerous attacks to match with the improved animations:Light Openers, Chains & FinishersHeavy Openers & FinishersWild Cat's PounceZone AttackPredator's MercyWild Cat's SwiftnessThe following attacks will hit extern...",1750172674,
304390,Warrior's Den Recap - Y9S2 TU1,"The Warrior's Den returned on June 11th to kick off For Honor's latest season: Y9S2: Defiance, set to launch on June 12th. With a brand-new theme, exciting content updates, visual upgrades, and the beginning of the competitive circuit, the show laid out a packed roadmap. This season will also feature Hero Fests for Black Prior, Medjay, and Warlord, giving players the chance to explore these heroes with unique bundles and free week access throughout the season. In addition, the fan-favorite Hyper Duel throwback event is making a return this Title Update, bringing back intense 1v1 action. For more details, we suggest checking out the VOD for the Y9S2 TU1 Warrior's Den Livestream.Entering the Age of DefianceYear 9 Season 2 introduces a narrative shift, with the focus moving away from the advancing Khatun forces. Instead, Defiance centers on a pirate---the new hero skin, Captain Coalheart---and his crew aboard The Lonecrow. Coalheart sets out to claim a hidden treasure left behind after a violent storm forced the Horkos leader, Vortiger, to abandon his stronghold.The new Free Event Pass, Crashing Waves begins June 12th and ends July 3rd. This pass builds on this pirate theme and includes cosmetics like The Lonecrow's Crew battle outfit, the Captain's Flag mood effect, and the Crimson Sea Coin ornament. These items immerse players in the maritime tone of the season.Cosmetics and ContentSeasonal content arrives in waves. Launching on June 12th, the game will receive a new hero skin, Captain Coalheart available for the Pirate Hero, the Y9S2 Battle Pass and a Legacy Pass return from Y5S2, themed around extreme heat and hallucination. We also looked at the upcoming seasonal weapons.The Battle Pass features abyssal-themed cosmetics like the Abyssal Scourge outfit, Jackdaw's Shanty emote, and the Beggar's Treasure execution to only name a few.The Legacy Pass items are equally enticing and will include the Heavenly Mirage and Shriveling Mirage battle outfits, a paired emote (Head to Head), and a haunting execution called Mirage of Encirclement. And much more!On the fashion side, Viking heroes will receive all-new armor variations, which were shown off in detail. These new looks carry forward the raw, rugged energy of the North.Converted Map: A New BattlefieldWe have reimagined the Canyon battlefield into a converted map, launching alongside the season update. The transformation reflects the ongoing evolution of Heathmoor---war banners signifying the Khatuns' presence. The canyon now hides Vortiger's lost treasure, setting the stage for fierce new encounters in Dominion, Brawl and Duel.Behind the Visual Curtain: QoL and Graphics UpdatesThis season introduces technical improvements that enhance For Honor's visual fidelity. A new system called Skin Sub-Surface Scattering (SSSS) improves how light interacts with character models, especially visible on exposed skin. Alongside that, dynamic wind effects and improved water physics bring more life to environments. These upgrades contribute to a more immersive experience on the battlefield.Testing Grounds: Defensive Dodge Properties UpdateThis season's Testing Grounds segment focused on both assassin and non-assassin heroes. Updates included: all side deflects on front dodge for all assassin heroes and stance change in the dodge direction mechanics for all non-assassin heroes. As always, the Testing Grounds invite feedback from the community before any changes are finalized for live play.Competitive Play Returns: Triple Threat CircuitThe Triple Threat competitive circuit is back with high stakes and new structure. The first two qualifiers kick off on June 21st and 22nd, with points being introduced to determine the best of the best across the season. The tournament follows this format, we start with the 4v4 Dominion in season 2, followed by the 2v2 Brawl in season 3 then we conclude our competitive circuit with the 1v1 duals in season 4. This format promises fierce battles across a broad meta of various heroes.Patch Notes and BalancingWe shared details on the latest balance patch notes to reaffirm our commitment to transparent balancing as the game evolves. We encouraged players to use the Bug Reporter for tracking any ongoing issues.

304390,PATCH NOTES 2.59.0 – FOR HONOR,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/2029200bf7bcae9d99100a5f13b7114b4a9e866c.jpg IMPROVEMENT Menus - Heros page It's now possible to change the loadout preview directly from the character selection and Character customization screen by using RB/LB/Q/E buttons or the mouse (with added input button). A new option was added in the Filters page in the barracks, to allow you to switch between ""Match All"" and ""Match Any"", regarding the filter options. BALANCING CHANGES Varangian Guard Light Openers & Finishers are no longer enhanced. Developer's Comments: The risk/reward for Varangian Guard's Light attacks was too skewed in their favor. We are removing the Enhanced properties to tone down the pressure while keeping the defensive aspects intact, as these are core to the character's identity. Nobushi Side Dodge, Cobra Strike & Sidewinder Form have increased sideways movement. Kick has increased forward movement. Developer's Comments: Nobushi has many opportunities to perform dodges & dodge attacks, but they suffer from low lateral movement. This patch is a first step to making the character feel more fluid, with more side movement on Side Dodge, Cobra Strike & Sidewinder Form. Additionnaly, we're increase the forward movement of Kick to help it reach opponents further away, especially after entering Hidden Stance. Warmonger Light Openers are no longer enhanced. Viscious Impale's distance travelled has been reduced to 6.5m (from 8m) Developer's Comments: Warmonger is performing too well in all contexts. We're looking to tone down their power in duels and teamfights slightly. By removing the enhanced property on opener lights, Warmongers will have to work a little bit hard to reach their chain pressure. On a similar note, Warmonger can often deal a lot of damage on even Heavy parries. We want to mitigate this by reducing the distance covered with a successful Vicious Impale, so the wall splat doesn't occur as often. We will continue to monitor this to see if further changes are needed. Khatun Attack trajectories for Angry Storm & Ultimate Authority have been adjusted to better match weapon visuals. Developer's Comments: Khatun's trajectories for Angry Storm and Ultimate Authority were slightly under tuned, causing frustration as players would expect hits to occur. We've polished and improved the weapon trajectories to better match the attack animation. Overall, these are now slightly bigger and covers a wider angle. BUG FIXES FIGHTERS Khatun Fixed an issue where the Draconite Abomination effect doesn't work on Khatun's executions. Sohei Fixed an issue where the embossing doesn't cover entirely Shoei's left arm shoulder pad. Conqueror Fixed an issue where Conqueror's Dominatus Chest has golden embossing obscured. Aramusha Fixed an issue that caused Aramusha not to have any defense when changing guard after performing Blade Blockade. AUDIO Fixed an issue where Shugoki's Demon's Embrace doesn't play his scream voice line after a kill. Fixed an issue where Sohei has low volume or no voice lines at respawn. ",1745523490,

Heavy Finishers are now Unblockable. Zone Attack's second hit can be soft feinted into Light Attack in another direction. The following attacks now have increased forward movement: Chain Lights Heavy Openers Heavy Finishers Dev comment: Aramusha has been trailing a bit in effectiveness over time. The hero's rework helped in the past, but as other heroes have been adjusted Aramusha's own strengths have become less prevalent. To adjust this, we've made it so that any move that can access Deadly Feints is now Unblockable; this should help give the hero more pressure in many situations, and forces more of a reaction from opponents We've also done a Quality of Life pass on the hero's weapon trajectories as well as forward movement values to ensure they remain competitive. Sohei Light Openers can now chain to Heavy Soul Attacks Heavy Openers can now chain to Light Soul Attacks Mad Monk Opener can now chain to Mad Monk Extender Chain link timing from Mad Monk Attacks to Heavy Finishers is now 266 ms (down from 300ms) Mad Monk Opener guardbreak Vulnerability is now 433ms (up from 100ms) Dev comment: Sohei's limitations were intended to be part of how the hero plays, but after the meta settled it is now clear that some of these limitations were affecting the hero's viability too much. We've decided to remove chain limitations on Sohei, as well as allow Mad Monk Opener to chain into the Extender version, to give Sohei more versatility in how they gain their Souls. In addition, Mad Monk Opener no longer needs the low guardbreak Vulnerability window, and we have reverted the change. Finally, we've also adjusted frame advantage from Mad Monk attacks to Heavy Soul Attacks to ensure that players can no longer land Light attacks on the same frame as the Soul attack lands, stopping Sohei's momentum. We're keeping an eye on the hero to see if further changes are needed, and will adjust as necessary. Pirate Pirate can no longer cancel Grand Cavelier's Recovery with a Dodge Dev comment: We removed the Enhanced ability on Orochi and Berserker's Side Dodge attacks to lower the incidence of using these attacks combined with Dodge Recovery Cancels to reduce their safety in group fights. As Pirate's dodge attacks are Heavy attacks, it feels much less natural to remove their Enhanced property as it is the default property of Heavy attacks. On top of this, moving their input to Light attacks negatively impacts the hero's moveset as they should no longer chain to Gun Shots. To that effect, we're removing the hero's ability to Dodge Recovery Cancel from Grand Cavalier altogether, on hit/block and miss. This should lower the hero's elusiveness in group fights and make them fairer to fight in these situations. BUG FIXES FIGHTERS Khatun Fixed an issue that allowed players to target swap during Rising Rage's strike Fixed an issue where Khatun is invulnerable to guardbreak in the first 100ms of their Sprint attack's second strike Fixed an issue where Khatun Sobbing Uncontrollably Emote is 7000 steel instead of 5000. Fixed an issue where Khatun boots Material wasn't updated Fixed an issue where Mjolnir's Flight and Sylvan Vaporization Execution are available for Khatun Kensei Fixed an issue where Shiwasu helm is Clipping with multiple Ornaments of Kensei in barrack and in game Tiandi Fixed an issue where Tiandi's Guan Suo Chest paint pattern on legs does not cover full area General Issues Fixed an issue where Forged In War Ornament is visible in locked state outside of unlock period Fixed an issue where Crusader Battle Outfit is missing for all knight legacy heroes ",1741876521,

This lets them beat Guardbreak attempts in multiple situations, but this did not apply to the listed heroes; we've therefore adjusted their Guardbreak Vulnerability to give them both more consistency with other heroes but also as a buff to these attacks. Raider Top Chained Heavy now deals 29 damage (up from 28) Side Chained Heavy now deals 27 damage (up from 26) Raider's Fury now deals 30 damage (up from 28) Top Heavy Finisher now deals 32 damage (up from 30) Side Heavy Finishers now deal 30 damage (up from 28) Dev comment: We previously lowered Raider's damage as the hero's curve was too high. After the dust has settled, Raider has been underperforming, so we're raising the damage the hero causes with some of his attacks to make Raider more competitive. Varangian Guard Chain Link timing from blocked Dodge Attacks and Hjaldr Oathkeeper to Light Finishers is now 300ms (up from 200ms) Dev comment: Varangian Guard's dodge attacks as well as Hjaldr Oathkeeper made the following Light finisher undodgeable when blocked, and so we're increasing the Chain Link timing to lower their reward. Black Prior Tenebris Trust now has a Superior Block window of 200ms (down from 300ms), from 100ms to 300ms into the attack (from 100ms to 400ms) Dev comment: We're reducing the Superior Block window for Tenebris Trust so that it correctly matches other Superior Block windows at 200ms. Afeera Removed ""Unlock Tech"" that allowed Afeera to perform Astro Flip in incorrect directions when unlocking after attacks Dev comment: While we made changes to Afeera in the last patch, there still remained situations where players could still perform the bug. We've applied a second fix to fully remove Afeera's ability to Astro Flip in incorrect directions. BUG FIXES GENERAL Fixed an issue where the players contacts are offset during the Respectful Kill Execution Fixed an issue where the fire texture in the Shard Defender spawn is offset Fixed an issue where the commands aren't displayed when a player is dead and spectate a teammate at ballista ",1737743867,

At the beginning of the season, General Zhi, a cunning Wu-Lin general, offered Astrea the Starfall sword under the guise of forging an alliance. Astrea, ever suspicious, accepted the gift but brought her entire army as a precaution. Unbeknownst to her, General Zhi was secretly allied with Guljin, a powerful Mongol Khatun. In a devastating ambush, Guljin's forces overwhelmed Astrea's larger army, leaving Heathmoor under Guljin's control and her twisted vision of peace. New Hero : Khatun The highlight of the season is the new hero: Guljin, The Khatun. She unified the Mongol tribes into a formidable force. Once dismissed as barbarians, they now command global attention. The Khatuns are brutal assassins, using fear as their primary weapon. Guljin's vision is a peaceful Heathmoor, united under her empire, free from petty wars. She expects her opponents to cower behind their walls until they surrender. To make sure they do, she rewards enemy cowardice while destroying all opposition with spectacular shows of strength. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/5f926bdb7981233d03fc608c2619fba7d7772a35.jpg This title update will also feature a free Event Pass Khatun's Peace, available to play from January 23rd to February 13th - coming with great rewards: Battle Outfit: Wandering Horde Ornament: Majestic Wanderer Mood Effect: Eternal Wanderer Weapons: Sneak Peek Images {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/f4fe99fe50398f36551fcb889d33aac8bba387b4.jpg Throwback event: Battle of The Eclipse This title update will also see the return of Battle of the Eclipse from Year 4, Season 4.

304390,Patch Notes 2.56.1 - FOR HONOR,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/3bb2a571baf186da12ea923bd6c57135ed25fb26.png Patch Notes 2.56.1 - FOR HONOR December 5, 2024 IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS BALANCING CHANGES Warden Feat rework Body Count has been replaced by Death Toll Death Toll: Killing Soldiers and Pikemen now grants you 3 Health and 3 Stamina Fiat Lux has been replaced by Enfeeble Enfeeble: Hitting an opponent with Shoulder Bash reduces their damage by 10% for 10 seconds Takedown has been replaced by Total Recovery Total Recovery: Whenever you revive an ally, they return at full Health instead of Half Health Catapult has been replaced by Trebuchet Trebuchet: Call a quick Trebuchet strike to deal 70 damage over an area. There is no fall off damage within the affected area. The damage is dealt 1 second after the Feat is used. Cooldown: 180 seconds. Dev comments: We've reintegrated Warden's Feat Testing grounds into the game. The feats remain mostly unchanged from the Testing Grounds except for Takedown which now reduces Attack Damage by 10% instead of 20%. Sohei Heavy Opener Attacks now gain Uninterruptible Stance at 400ms during the attack Mad Monk now gains Uninterruptible Stance at 400ms during the attack Soul Attacks now have more forward movement and rotation speed Sohei now gains Souls when a Soul Attack trades on the same frame as an opponent's attack Sohei can no longer gain Souls on a successful Bulwark Counter from Black Prior Dev comments: Sohei's attacks are slow on purpose; the hero is the largest hero we've built, and considering both Guardbreak and Parry chain to the Soul Attacks it is fine that the Heavy Openers are slow. However, this comes at a cost where the attacks are more difficult to use than intended. We've thus given them and Mad Monk Uninterruptible Stance to help them trade and lead to Sohei's Soul Attacks in an easier fashion. We are looking at the hero's performance further and will adjust more if necessary. Lawbringer NEW MOVE: Precise Jurisdiction Performed after a Front Dodge by pressing Light Attack Can be performed in all three stances NEW MOVE: Final Jurisdiction Performed after a Front Dodge by pressing Heavy Attack Can be performed in all three stances Top Heavy Opener now deals 25 damage (up from 23) Side Heavy Openers now deal 22 damage (up from 20) Dev comments: Lawbringer needs a way to catch opponents that are running away reliably, but has a unique aspect in his moveset where the hero can perform his Opener Light and Heavy attacks during his Front Dodge, creating unique mixup opportunities with his Front Dodge Shove. We did not want to remove that unique factor from Lawbringer while also giving him a way to chase opponents, and thus we created two new moves, which keep the functionality of the Opener attacks during the Front Dodge but with more forward movement to get up close to opponents. We also adjusted Lawbringer's Top and Side Heavy openers to deal 2 extra damage, which should help in situations where Lawbringer gets wall staggers and performs these attacks. Nuxia Reworked Zone Attack Attack is now a 2-hit Attack The first hit is a 500ms attack that deals 11 damage The second hit is a 800ms attack that deals 24 damage The second hit can be feinted and can also be soft feinted into Traps Dev comments: Nuxia's Zone Attack is a potent mixup with high damage potential, but is difficult to use, especially when outnumbered, due to its slow speed. With this new change, she should have an easier time hitting multiple opponents, and should have an easier time leading to Traps. Hitokiri Now has 125HP (down from 140HP) Now has 120 Stamina (down from 130 Stamina) Rei Kick and Rei Sweep no longer drain Stamina Endless Myriad now has less forward movement Dev comments: Hitokiri is still overperforming after the Trajectory changes, and so we're targeting some aspects of the hero to make them perform a bit less. We've lowered their HP by 15, making trading with the hero less optimal, and lowered their Stamina by 10 to also force them to conserve Stamina more effectively and attack less. Their bashes also no longer drain Stamina, which puts Hitokiri back into Stamina deficit, and Endless Myriad now moves forward less, which should help with target swapping situations and hitting people externally. We're keeping an eye on the hero still and will adjust as necessary. Varangian Guard Standardized Superior Block window on the following attacks to 200ms, down from 300ms Opener Lights Finisher Lights Sellsword's Bounty Sellsword's Valor Hjaldr Oathkeeper Dev comment: We initially put Varangian Guard's Superior Block window on her Light attacks to be 300ms to encourage players to use them and to have more opportunities to properly block with the attacks. While it did have the intended effect, it also came with an unintended side effect being too strong and being able to Superior Block attacks too easily. We are thus changing their timing to be in line with other Superior Block attacks in the game, with a 200ms window, from 100m...",1735920753,

304390,Patch Notes 2.55.0 - FOR HONOR,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/3cf86e2fcf3bec111b1c29698663e2ec0ce48234.png IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS BALANCING CHANGES Global Throw victims are now fully invulnerable to Guard Break for the duration of the throw Dev comment: Following a data review, we've noticed an inconsistency with throws; the throw victims sometimes became vulnerable to Guard Break during the throw, and while the Guard Break attempts were counterable, this still caused consistency issues and could lead to big damage during ganks. We've thus standardized this; victims of throws are now fully Guard Break invulnerable while they are in the thrown animation. Orochi Storm Rush is no longer Undodgeable when performed from the Right or Left stances Dev comment: We changed Storm Rush to be Undodgeable from all stances a while ago, and while it has proven to be successful in locking down opponents, it also creates a lot frustration for players. With this change, there is now an extra way to deal with Storm Rush, as well as making it more predictable in how it can be countered. Varangian Guard Chain Link timing from Opener Light attacks to Finisher Light attacks are now 300ms (up from 200ms) Weapon trajectories have been adjusted to better match weapon visuals. The following attacks now have smaller weapon trajectories: Side Light Openers and Finishers Side Heavy Openers and Finishers Zone Attack Side Dodge Lights Side Heavies in Oathkeeper Stance Zone Attack in Oathkeeper Stance The following attacks have been adjusted to hit external opponents in front of the hero: Top Light Opener and Finisher Top Heavy Opener and Finisher Front Dodge Light Top Heavy in Oathkeeper Stance Light attacks in Oathkeeper Stance Dev comment: Varangian Guard has been a source of frustration for players as their attacks tended to hit too far outside of their weapon swings. We've adjusted these so they match the weapon visuals better; they can still hit opponents around you, but should have less range. We've also adjusted a handful of attacks that could not hit opponents Varangian Guard was not locked on to but who were in front of the hero, which also did not match the weapon visuals. We've also identified an issue where players could not dodge Light Finishers if chained after a Light Opener. We've adjusted this to make the hero follow our standard rules in this regard. Hitokiri Weapon trajectories have been adjusted to better match weapon visuals The following attacks now have smaller weapon trajectories Side Heavy Openers Side Chained Heavy attacks Charged Heavy attacks Zone Attack Side Dodge Attacks Running Attack The following attacks have been adjusted to hit external opponents in front of the hero: Light Openers Light Finishers Front Dodge Heavy Dev comments: Hitokiri has been overperforming in our data at all skill levels. We're nerfing the hero's weapon trajectories as a first step, as this is a major source of frustration and strength at all skill levels. We're keeping an eye on the hero and will adjust if necessary in the future. Kyoshin The following weapon trajectories have been adjusted to better match weapon visuals Light Openers and Finishers Heavy Openers and Finishers Zone Attack Running Attack Zone Attack Dodge Attacks Kaze Stance Light, Heavy, and Zone Attack Forced lateral movement has been removed from Light Openers Forward Movement on Top Heavy Opener is now more consistent with the forward movement on Side Heavy Openers Dev comment: After a data review, we noticed that Kyoshin's weapon trajectories did not properly match the weapon visuals, and caused issues with the hero not hitting external opponents in various scenarios where they should. We've adjusted the majority of the hero's attacks so that these situations are minimized. Lawbringer Side Dodge Shove Now has extra side movement following the direction of the dodge Now is invulnerable from 100ms to 300ms during the attack Dev comments: Lawbringer previously did not have iframes during their side dodge Shove attacks; this was done to properly match motion and invulnerability and avoid attacks clipping through the hero too much. We've adjusted the side movement of the attack, and as such the attacks can now have proper iframes at the same timing as other heroes. This is a significant buff to Lawbringer which removes the necessity of delaying Shove during a side dodge to avoid getting hit by attacks. Conqueror Side Dodge Shield Bash Now has extra side movement following the direction of the dodge Now is invulnerable from 100ms to 300ms during the attack Dev comments: Similarly to Lawbringer, Conqueror had the same issue with Shield Bash on side dodges - we've also updated the movement as well as the iframes of the attacks so they are consistent with the rest of the cast. Sohei Soul Tetsubo now feeds the correct amount of revenge Dev comments: Sohei's Soul Tetsubo had a bug where the attack fed revenge as if it was a Bash attack. We've fixed the issue, and are keeping an eye on the hero as it is curre...",1729799178,

304390,Patch Notes 2.53.1 – FOR HONOR,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/b3710459eada6b4334f997497ba975442a596ed0.png IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS BALANCING CHANGES Orochi Zephyr Slash is no longer enhanced, including on off-target opponents Top Heavy Finisher now deals 30 damage (down from 32) Side Heavy Finishers now have smaller weapon trajectories to better match their weapon Heavy Finishers now have less forward movement Chain Link Timing from Dust Devil to Heavy Finishers is now 100ms slower at a minimum Dev Comment: Orochi has been overperforming at all levels of play. We're addressing some of the most critical issues for the hero at the moment, and will keep an eye on the hero as players adapt to the changes. We're applying the change we made to Berserker's side dodge attacks to Orochi as well, seeing as the experiment seems to have been successful at knocking down Berserker's effectiveness in group fights. We're also addressing Orochi's Heavy Finishers, which are some of his strongest points. We're lowering the damage of the Top Heavy Finisher as it tends to overperform and is very easy to access, and we're also lowering the trajectory size of the hero's Side Heavy Finishers as they cover too much ground. On top of these changes, we're also lowering the forward movement these moves have as they tend to cover too much ground and are too strong against external opponents. Finally, we're slowing down the chain link timing from Dust Devil to Heavy Finishers so that Orochi can no longer get a guaranteed Side Heavy Finisher on opponents when target swapping after a Dust Devil. We're keeping an eye on Orochi and will see where he ends up to address further issues should they pop up. Warmonger Preying Claw now can be performed from 100ms to 500ms after a Front Dodge (was 300ms to 500ms) Dev Comment: We've done this change for Warden in the past, and it ended up being very successful with Warden at giving the hero a better way to open up opponents. Warmonger currently has a more difficult time opening up, and we're making this change for the hero so enhance those capabilities. Lawbringer Top Heavy Opener now deals 23 damage (up from 20) Zone Attack and Make Way now deal 16 damage (up from 15) Impaling Riposte and Impaling Charge now deal 3 damage (up from 1) Dev Comment: We're adjusting a few of Lawbringer's damage numbers to make the hero more effective in a few situations and to give back utility to some specific punishes. Zone Attack and Make Way dealing 16 damage puts them more in line with other similar attacks, and gives Lawbringer a slightly better Heavy Parry Punish. The changes to Top Heavy opener and Impaling Riposte specifically are meant to address a situation where Lawbringer would always get less damage by using Impaling Riposte after a Light Parry and getting a wall splat than using Blind Justice. At 26 minimum damage right now this means that Lawbringer is not as disadvantaged when using this option in the kit. Berserker Chain Link timing between Zone Attack and Chained Light attack when buffered is now 266ms (was 100ms) Dev Comment: Before this change, opponents had a single frame in which to time a parry attempt for the Chained Light attack after a Zone Attack. Now, the window to parry is more in-line with other heroes, and should give players a higher chance to parry the attack. Varangian Throws now wallsplat from 700ms to 1500ms (was 1000ms to 1500ms) Dev comment: Varangian had an issue where if you were close to a wall, a throw would wallsplat too late and Varangian was not able to get their correct Heavy Attack punish on the opponent. With this change, it should always be guaranteed. Jiang jun Can now enter Sifu's Poise at the same timing as Dodge is allowed during recoveries on hit Dev comment: With this change, Jiang Jun can now effectively use Sifu's Poise then use Sifu's Swirl to punish fast bash attempts. This should give the hero better defensive capabilities, especially in 1v1 scenarios. PHOTO MODE Added a Photo Mode in the barracks and in-game Dev comment: A Photo Mode is now available in the Barracks' Hero Overview and in-game (for solo content only). Photo Mode offers filters, frames and settings to edit the photo before saving it. It also offers, in-game only, two camera modes to move around to take the perfect shot. BUG FIXES GENERAL Fixed an issue where Feinting on the last possible frame caused a Feint of next inputted attack FH-1836 FIGHTERS Berserker Fixed an issue where Berserker's Moveset Page showed incorrect properties on Head Slicer Afeera Fixed an issue where Afeera would sometimes fail to play sounds CUSTOMIZATION Fixed an issue with Hitokiri Body Type 2's Miyoshino Chest laces area FH-7353 Fixed an issue where paint patterns weren't centered on Warden's Corporis Chest FH-7323 Fixed an issue where paint patterns weren't centered on Warden's Radiavi Chest FH-7331 Fixed an issue with Valkyrie's Pra Chest incorrectly showing the upper part of the Fulla Chest FH-7284 Fixed an issue where color does not get applied on t...",1721924455,

We are improving these attacks to gain Uninterruptible Stance to help protect Warden in these situations, and we have also changed their animations to make them fully distinguishable from their neutral attack counterparts, with the exception of the Top Light followup, which still gains Uninterruptible Stance but keeps its old animation in order to keep the Superior Block property. * *Note that these attacks deal the same amount of damage and chain t...",1714066261,

Under this theme, we're going to explore the most valuable asset in the world of war, the weapons. Our weapons define how we fight and remind us of what we fight for. Throughout Year 8, we are going to explore four stories that unfold around legendary weapons. In some cases these legends are forged through the actions of our heroes and in other cases our heroes may pick up a weapon that already has a legend embedded within which will bring on an entirely new challenge, living up to the weapons name. https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/jAYAmvv6O8hasPbfTewOt/bd85007906347f11e8b14b65588a0054/KWM_FHY8_ROADMAP_Final_1920x1080.jpg Year 8 New Features During the Warrior's Den, we went over some new features coming to year 8.

Additionally, we'll provide you with a high-level overview of what to expect in Year 8. For more in-depth discussions, don't forget to explore the Warrior's Den Y7S TU2 VOD]. Year 8 Sneak Peek Year 8 is set to kick off on March 14th, featuring a structured format with four seasons. Excitingly, players can anticipate the introduction of two new heroes and new hero skins. Notably, heroes will be introduced in Seasons 2 and 4, body type locked. Something new in Year 8 is the addition of converted maps. The plan is to transform non-Dominion maps into Dominion maps. Throughout the year, two maps are scheduled for conversion. The goal is to make the pool of Dominion maps bigger. An addition to our offer in Year 8 is the Legacy Pass, which brings back previous battle passes in chronological order. For example, in Year 8, Season 1, players can purchase or continue the Year 4 Season 1 battle pass and progress through it. This pattern continues with subsequent seasons, allowing players to maintain their old progressions and progress through multiple passes simultaneously. The Legacy Pass includes a tier 101 that consolidates all retrofitted content for heroes not initially part of the Battle Pass. The Legacy Pass will be $9.99 US or included in the Battle Bundle, which retains its cost at $24.99 US. The battle bundle will now consist of the 2 passes, unlocks 25 tiers in both passes, and offers a 20% Battle Pass Boost. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/9c475a69bd5ceb08c3d7bf66e927ea5c0bcc632e.png For a quick recap of what was covered in TU1, check out our November 30th article here. ""The oath bought and sold is worth no coin at all."" The Varangian Guards' journey is encapsulated by the phrase, This mantra reflects their steadfast dedication, emphasizing that their loyalty cannot be compromised by monetary gains. Originating from distant lands beyond Heathmoor, the Varangian Guards, a group of mercenary Vikings, have flourished. United by an unwavering commitment, these warriors are renowned for their absolute loyalty. Once they pledge an oath, there is no wavering; they remain steadfastly true to both their client and themselves. As they ventured into uncharted territories, these formidable fighters transcended their Viking roots, embracing the role of mercenaries. Despite this transformation, their Viking essence persists, evolving into something more - elite bodyguards possessing unparalleled combat skills. In battle, the Varangian Guards epitomize protectors with unrivaled defensive prowess, making them invaluable assets in any conflict. Armed with axes and shields, they employ their distinctive defensive stance, Oathkeeper, to disable adversaries. Their combat finesse, finely honed over time, strikes a harmonious balance between refined skill and unbridled Viking ferocity. The Hero will come with two sets and will be exclusively available for purchase starting February 1st for 7.99$ as a bundle that includes the Hero, one Ornament, one Elite Outfit, seven days of Champion Status and three scavenger crates. Players will also be able to unlock the hero starting February 14th for 15 000 Steel in-game. In addition to the Varangian Guard and TU2 release, a free Event Pass: Varangian Guard's Pledge, will be available from February 1st to February 22nd. Exclusive, limited-time rewards will be available during this time such as an ornament, effect, and more.

304390,Patch Notes 2.481 – For Honor,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/efd6dc4d89140a45b99f586cb271fcf795fb357e.png IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS Front Dodge Bash changes In the previous patch, we've sped up our 500ms front dodge bashes to be 433ms. This introduced an unfortunate interaction where these attacks could reliably be dodged on a single timing. We've made the following changes to ensure there is no singular dodge timing to beat these attacks: All 433ms Front Dodge Bashes now lose tracking 100ms later during the attack against dodging opponents The following heroes have their Front Dodge recovery lowered by 100ms: Conqueror Jormungandr Zhanhu Additional changes Medjay's Throne Room Tackle can now be performed starting at 300ms during their Front Dodge, up from 100ms Tiandi's Palm Strike can now be performed starting at 366ms during their Front Dodge, up from 300ms Dev comments: The changes to the way Front Dodge Bashes track opponents makes it to that delayed Front Dodge Bashes will now properly connect against early dodges. This should return to the type of play we had before the changes, where the intent was that opponents had to read between dodging early or late; due to how the changes were implemented, there was an issue where a single dodge timing could beat buffered bashes, delayed bashes and dodge to guardbreak; with these new timings, this type of situation should no longer happen. To ensure this is also fixed on Conqueror, Jormungandr and Zhanhu, we've also lowered their recovery from Front Dodge so they can Guardbreak earlier and catch the outlier dodges that can effectively dodge both the buffered and delayed bashes. Finally, we've also applied a change to Medjay and Tiandi; Medjay's Throne Room Tackle was too oppressive at their new timings, while Tiandi's new timings meant that players had one less option to beat Tiandi when the hero performed a dodge cancel from Light attacks into Palm Strike. With this new change, players should be able to trade with Palm Strike by using a Light Attack. Hitokiri Meikai Rift (Light Finishers) no longer have Uninterruptible Stance. Hitokiri now gains Uninterruptible Stance at 100ms when performing Endless Myriad, down from starting at 300ms *Dev comment: Hitokiri used to have Uninterruptible Stance on Meikai Rift to be used as an early trading tool, but this proved to be awkward as the hero needed to end their chain and pressure to trade with opponents. As the hero's identity is to be a relentless attacker and have strong mixups, we've adjusted the position of the Uninterruptible Stance so Hitokiri is able to use their chained Heavies more effectively in outnumbered situations and be more difficult to peel.* Chain Link Timing changes from Opener Light attack to Rei Kick / Rei Sweep On Hit and On Block, chain link timing now starts at 333ms, up from 200ms On Miss, chain link timing now starts at 233ms, up from 100ms *Dev comment: With Hitokiri's chained Heavy attacks getting better Uninterruptible Stance timings, we changed this chain link timing to give opponents more options after the hero's Light Openers; they can now interrupt Rei Kick with a Light attack on a successful read.* Adjusted the Weapon Trajectories for all Heavy Attacks to have better range *Dev comment: One of our goals for Hitokiri is to ensure players can effectively use the hero's Side Heavy attacks in outnumbered situations, in combination with Uninterruptible Stance. Their current values were underwhelming and made it too difficult to hit external opponents; with these adjustments, they should hit more reliably and give Hitokiri more offense-based defense in group fights.* WHITE BONUS SPIRIT ARMOR Improved the White Bonus Spirit Armor, adapted the model to better fit Body Type 1 and fixed a few clipping issues LOCAL TONE MAPPING Added new Local Tone Mapping Display Option *Dev comments: Instead of using one average exposure value for the frame, we adjust it independently for different parts of the image.

Once a warrior without a home, he was welcomed into the village of Moldar by the people as one of their own. There, he found a new family and a place to belong. But when the Order of Horkos attacked, Maddox found himself torn. To prevent the slaughter of his people, he had to do the unthinkable. To survive, he had to break his oath to the Chimera Alliance - and to his family. Oathbreaker Maddox Hero Skin will cost 25,000 Steel and will be available starting December 7th, along with his short stories that will be available on our website starting December 8th. Patch Notes & Quality of Life Changes Along with a few changes to some heroes, we've implemented something known as local tone mapping. The main goal of this is to enhance visibility and provide a better experience overall. During the Warrior's Den, we showcased some before and after footage and the results look great. The tone mapping option is available to pc and next gen consoles. As far as hero improvements, there's been some changes to dodge bashes and Hitokiri received some changes as well. To hear the Dev Team comments on all the changes coming, we recommend you check out the VOD of the Y7S4 TU1 Warrior's Den. Testing Grounds During the Warrior's Den, we had a Testing Grounds segment where we showcased some theoretical changes to Medjay, Peacekeeper and Highlander. We implemented new moves for Medjay and Peacekeeper: For the Medjay, we implemented a new move called, ""Mid Chain Zone Attack"" For Peacekeeper we implemented a new move called, ""Iron Mountain"" For Highlander, our goal was to increase his Offensive Form Side Dodge attacks, as well as adding extra safety to entering Offensive Form. Testing Grounds will be open from December 14th to the 21st , so please be sure to participate and let us know your thoughts. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of the Testing Grounds, you can watch a VOD of the segment at Twitch.tv/ForHonorGame or read the Testing Grounds article here. Tournament Recap During this segment, we went over the winners of the finals of Into The Fray which took place back in October! Nemesis went undefeated, never dropping a game, and claimed first place. We had well over 300 participating teams and the games were casted by none other than Verbalosity and Norgoz. For full bracket results, visit our Battlefy page. The VOD of the Invitational Finals is also available on our twitch page, here. We also had Pro-Ams wrap up recently on Nov 19th, which had over 200 individuals participating. Each member of the winning teams were given a Kensei statue while second and third place were given steel codes. The winning teams for Pro-Ams were: EU: 1st - RED MOON 2nd - Pasta Vodka 3rd - GibtKeinNamE NA: 1st - Pro am team :) 2nd - TEAM SHAFT 3rd - i_have_memes is bad A bragging rights match also took place between ""RED MOON"" and ""Pro am team :)"", which was also streamed on our Twitch Page here.

304390,Patch Notes 2.47.1 – FOR HONOR,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/8c389a514fe7babcd1ce04458b6fbc6e8fe1c7fc.png IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS Front Dodge Melee Attacks We are now integrating the results from a previous Testing Grounds, in which we tested slightly faster speeds on Front Dodge Melee Attack, into the Live game. The intention of this change is to improve the viability of Front Dodge Melee Attack as an Opener, for all players. Certain Front Dodge Melee Attacks were significantly more reactable for certain parts of the population, so with this change we believe these moves should function successfully as Openers for all heroes who have them. After analysis of the data received from the Testing Grounds, we have determined that 433ms is the most appropriate speed for Front Dodge Melee Attacks. There was a significant reduction in reaction times from 500ms to 466ms, and another significant reduction from 466ms to 433ms, but 433ms to 400ms saw no change in reaction times. We have therefore adjusted these attacks to all be 433ms. We are keeping the timing at which you can perform them at 300ms into the Dodge. This should not have any impact on frame advantage and offers a significant input comfort over being able to perform the attacks later in the Dodge. One exception to the rule is Medjay's Throne Room Tackle, which takes the 433ms attack speed buff, but also keeps its ability to be performed at 100ms after a Front Dodge, as the hero is currently underperforming while in Axe Mode. This buff should give the hero a better chance to open up opponents. Finally, after investigating further, we have to slow down the Dodge Recovery Cancel timing on hit from Front Dodge Melee Attacks for Orochi and Tiandi so that they can be dodged by the opponent if repeatedly used. This only applies to the attacks on Hit, and has no impact on timings on Miss. List of changes: We have normalized the speed and the chain link timings for all non-charged Melee Attacks initiated from a Front Dodge. The following changes were made: All non-charged Front Dodge Melee Attacks are now 433ms Most non-charged Front Dodge Attacks are now performed from 300ms to 500ms This applies to the following attacks: Ocelotl's Jaguar's Grudge Shaolin's Flying Monkey Variant Jiang Jun's Mighty Kick Tiandi's Palm Strike Shugoki's Headbutt Zhanhu's Subduing Blow Shinobi's Reaper's Dance Kyoshin's Sajin-Arashi Orochi's Dust Devil Warlord's Headbutt Jormungandr's Jotunn Surge Gryphon's Shove Black Prior's Jawbreaker (from Front Dodge only) Gladiator's Sucker Punch Centurion's Legion Kick Lawbringer's Shove Conqueror's Shield Bash Medjay's Throne Room Tackle received the following changes: Is now 433ms (down from 500ms) Can be performed at 100ms during Front Dodge Additional changes: Tiandi Palm Strike Dodge Recovery on Hit: Can now recovery cancel from 333ms (up from 300ms) Orochi Dust Devil Dodge Recovery on Hit: Can now recovery cancel from 233ms (up from 200ms) UI Sorting & Filtering Added Sorting and Filtering options in the Barracks that allows players to filter the customization Inventory can be generally sorted by Alphabetical order or Release Date. Some content such as Gear can be sorted by Recently Looted, and Executions by Durations. For Filtering, we allow players to select more one than option, and the items will show as long as they are part of one of the filters. Players will be able to filter Battle Pass or Event Pass content, Event Loot, Cross Brand, Sales, etc. Some specific content has their own filters, for example Emotes can be filtered by Paired, Unique or Shared. BUG FIXES FIGHTERS Ocelotl Fixed an issue that caused the Ocelotl to start a forward walking animation when exiting lock (FH-5899) Fixed an issue that caused the Ocelotl Huntsman's Spirit to sometimes not work properly when entering Breaking (FH-5978) Kyoshin Fixed an issue that caused the Kyoshin scabbard to be offset during neutral dodges (FH-4709) MAP Fixed an issue that caused the players to fall through the map when respawning in the Forest Map in Skirmish (FH-5440) SOUND Fixed an issue that caused the Afeera and Ocelotl sound effect to randomly mute during 4v4 matches (FH-5906) CUSTOMIZATION Fixed an issue that caused the Kyoshin ""Stellar Blaze"" outfit to be locked even if the players bought it in the past (FH-6075) Fixed an issue that caused the Shinobi ""Sagasu Helm"" to have paint patterns, symbols and embossings misaligned (FH-5951) Fixed an issue that caused the Domain of the Wyvern effect (unlocked with Shield of Wyverndale illustrious outfit) to have lower bright eyes (FH-5908) Fixed an issue that caused the Gladiator ""Floriferum Chest"" to have stretched textures on left legging for Body Type 2 (FH-5845) Fixed an issue that caused the Warden and Warmonger sheathing animations to be glitching with any shared execution (FH-5188)",1698348136,['patchnotes']

304390,Patch Notes 2.46.0,"IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS Reflex Guard Removal Reflex Guard has been removed from all Assassin heroes as well as Shaolin. Heroes that had Reflex Guard now have Static Guard Dev comment: Reflex Guard's time has come to an end. It has been in the game since launch, and over time its presumed advantage (of attempting to hide the guard stance) became more and more outweighed by its disadvantages (failing to block attacks). So with this change, all Reflex Guard heroes now have the same Static Guard as regular heroes: so Assassins (and Shaolin) no longer have to refresh their guard between hits, and no longer have to worry about their guard disappearing for a small period of time when it expires. Note that these heroes keep everything else, including Deflects, and so this is purely a buff to every old Reflex Guard hero. Lawbringer Revamp Integration We're integrating the Lawbringer revamp with some significant changes to what was played in both rounds of Testing Grounds for the hero. We've opted for a middle ground - some changes were appreciated, while others were not, and so we've decided to address the more problematic issues with the hero while keeping some of more loved kit intact. Some of the more significant changes to the hero are the following: Impaling Riposte is now only guaranteed after Light Parries (as its damage potential was too high off Heavy Parries) Swift Justice can now be accessed after Heavy Openers (to shortcut to Finishers) Chained Heavy Attacks now have Uninterruptible Stance (to let Lawbringer use offensive tools in group fights more effectively) Note that the changes listed here are what changed from the old Live version of Lawbringer compared to the new version of Lawbringer; if a change is not listed here, it means the move has not changed, even if we had tested changes in the Testing Grounds. Stamina Drain, Stamina Pause, Stun All instances of Stamina Drain, Stamina Regeneration Pause and Stun have been removed from Lawbringer's moves. Shove Front Dodge Shove's miss recovery now regains guard in the last 100ms of the recovery Chain Shove's miss recovery now regains guard in the last 100ms of the recovery Heavy Openers Now deal 20 damage (down from 24) Now chains to a guaranteed Swift Justice on hit when performed in the same stance Top Heavy Opener recovery changes Hit and Block Recovery is now 800ms (down from 900ms) Miss recovery is now 800ms (down from 1000ms) Side Heavy Openers recovery changes Hit and Block Recovery is now 800ms (down from 1000ms) Miss Recovery is now 800ms (down from 1100ms) Heavy Chained Attacks Now deal 26 damage (down from 27 on sides and 28 on top) Now gain Uninterruptible Stance at 100ms Chained Top Heavy is now 800ms (down from 900ms) Recoveries are now 800ms on Hit, Block and Miss Heavy Chain Finishers Now deals 28 damage (down from 30 on sides and 32 on top) Top Heavy Finisher is now 966ms (down from 1100ms) Top Heavy Finisher can now be soft feinted into Guardbreak Top Heavy Finisher now moves forward 1.25m more during the attack Miss recoveries are now 900ms (down from 1100ms) Swift Justice Now accessible after a Heavy Opener hit as well as a Top Heavy Finisher hit Now counts as the 2nd hit in chain and chains to Finishers Attack is now 200ms and deals 4 damage Parry Followups Blind Justice and Impaling Riposte can now be performed from 600ms to 700ms after a Parry (down from 500ms to 666ms) Blind Justice now deals 25 damage (down from 32) Blind Justice now initiates chains and chains to Swift Justice on hit Light Riposte is now 300ms (up from 200ms) Light Riposte now counts as the 2nd attack in chain and chains to Finishers Impaling Riposte is now 1100ms (up from 800ms) Make Way now costs 30 stamina (down from 60) Make Way now initiates chains Long Arm Can no longer be performed from Guardbreak Now pins for 1333ms (up from 1200ms) Chain link timing to Heavy Openers is now 1200ms for Top and 1300ms for Sides (down from 1600ms for both) Zone Attack Now costs 30 stamina (down from 60) Now initiates chains Miss recovery is now 600ms (down from 300ms) Quality of Life changes Front Dodge now lasts 900ms (down from 1000ms) Chain link timing to Heavy Finishers is now 100ms to 300ms (down from 200ms to 300ms) Side Light Finisher attack trajectories adjusted to better match weapon visuals Back Throw distance is reduced by 1.25m Medjay All Staff Mode Chained Heavy Attacks now deal 28 damage (down from 30 on sides and 32 on top) All Staff Mode Finisher Heavy Attacks now deal 30 damage (down from 32 on sides and 34 on top) Adjusted attack trajectories to better match weapon visuals for the following attacks: All Staff Mode Light and Heavy Attacks Staff Mode Zone Attack Dev comment: Medjay's Staff mode was overperforming in a lot of instances; the damage was too high, and the attack trajectories for a lot of their attacks did not match the weapon visuals, which caused situations where strikes would hit external opponents when the weapons were not colliding.

304390,Patch Notes 2.45.1 – For Honor,"NEW HERO: OCELOTL Description: ""The prey should hear nothing but its own scream."" The Ocelotl hail from the great Aztec Empire. Master hunters, their name means ""Jaguar Warrior"" in their native tongue of Nahuatl. The Ocelotl stalk their enemies with predator patience -- only to tear them to shreds in moments. Efficient and calculating, they wield a macuahuitl club and tepoztopilli spear to maul their prey as the situation warrants. They are ferocious fighters who never forget a grudge. Fighting Style Difficulty: Medium Fast & Relentless Offense Disabler & Ganker Special Capabilities Instead of dying, becomes a Huntsman's Spirit Infinite Chains with Light, Heavy, Zone and Melee attacks Unique Hunter's Stance for extra mobility Unique Hunter's Snare to surprise opponents with a far reaching, disabling attack IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS Centurion Charged Jab now gains Uninterruptible Stance at 900ms (down from 1000ms) Developer's Comment:* With this change, we are adding safety to using Charged Jab after a Heavy Attack; it should no longer be interruptible by a Light Attack by your opponent, giving your opponent one less option to deal with Charged Jab.* Nuxia Caltrops changes: Cooldown is now 90 seconds (up from 45 seconds) Is now active for 15 seconds (down from 25 seconds) Developer's Comment:* Caltrops is one of the strongest Tier 2 feats available in the game, with its ability to deal a lot of damage as well as efficiently clear the minion lane for extended periods of time. With these changes, Caltrops is still an efficient minion lane clearing tool, but the feat's uptime has been lowered significantly, ensuring it must be used at more opportune times.* Jormungandr Jotun Farewell no longer chains on miss Hammer Slam now deals 26 damage (down from 30) Developer's Comment:* These changes are meant to tweak the risk/reward ratio of using Jotun Farewell; before these changes, Jormungandr took a low risk throwing Jotun Farewell as the only reliable response their opponents had was performing a dodge attack for an average of 14 damage and dealing 30 (and with Feats, extending that life lead even more). With these changes, Jormungandr must not only commit more as their opponents now get a Guard Break on a correct read, awarding an average 24 damage, but also deal less damage when their opponents do not get a correct read, lowering that extended life lead. This also promotes more varied gameplay scenarios when playing as and against a Jormungandr.* PERFORMANCE MODE Added a Performance Mode on supported consoles. Developer's Comment:On consoles, a new Graphic Mode option is added to choose between the existing Quality Mode and the new Performance Mode. Performance Mode brings unlocked FPS/Vsync with VRR (requires VRR compatible hardware), at 1080p resolution with reduced graphic upgrades. See Performance Mode article for more details. EASY ANTI-CHEAT Updated Easy Anti-Cheat client module and library. Developer's Comment:* This update of Easy Anti-Cheat makes the game playable on Steam Deck.* UI Players can now ""Group Dismantle"" Gear in both the Reward and Scavenger Gear screens. Developer's Comment:* This is a quality of life improvement that allows you to mark all the Gear, and then Dismantle them all at once (rather than individually as before)* BUG FIXES FIGHTERS Jiang Jun Fixed an issue that caused the Jiang Jun Sifu's Poise breathing sound effect to continue playing even when Stamina is full Jormungandr Fixed an issue that caused the Jormungandr Chain Zone to not be useable while Out of Lock (FH-5393) Warlord Fixed an issue where Warlord can't perform Back Slammer execution from opponent's back UI Fixed an issue that caused some Custom Match options like Parry Flash Indicator and Renown to not be displayed in Map Overview (FH-4389) SOUND Fixed an issue that caused an explosion sound effect to be missing in Kazan Castle near second Attacker spawn (FH-3011) CUSTOMIZATION Fixed an issue that caused the Orochi Honkyo Helm to not be connected to body with some chest pieces Fixed an issue that caused the Orochi ""Tooth Fairy"" execution to play correctly against some opponents Fixed an issue that caused some Warmonger chest pieces to not apply paint patterns Fixed an issue that caused the ""Candlelit Shrine"" to display different colors than what is displayed in game Fixed an issue that caused the Shinobi Ryuseigun Helm to have missing textures (FH-5463) ",1690488048,['patchnotes']

Master hunters, their name means “Jaguar Warrior” in their native tongue of Nahuatl. The Ocelotl stalks their enemies with predator patience -- only to tear them to shreds in moments. Efficient and calculating, they wield a macuahuitl club and tepoztopilli spear to maul their prey as the situation warrants. They are ferocious fighters who never forget a grudge. With the Cataclysm leaving much of Mesoamerica altered, the Ocelotl came to occupy a tropical jungle while maintaining their historic seat of power in Tenochtitlán. They interpreted the Cataclysm as a mass sacrifice -- a divine condemnation for their wastefulness of energy, which had not properly circulated to the gods with enough blood rites and penance. In answer, the Ocelotl adopted an intensely ascetic way of life so their conserved energy might prevent another Cataclysm. The exceptions to their austerity were their magnificent cities of gold, meant to pay tribute to the many deities in their pantheon. Although originally having little gold, the Aztec empire seized the wealth of neighboring civilizations that were destroyed. They peacefully traded some surplus with passing merchant ships and pirates -- until the empire was invaded by Horkos, who decimated the land and people to steal the Aztec treasure. Having learned seafaring from pirates, the Ocelotl now set sail for Heathmoor. They come to exact vengeance. The Hero will come with two sets and will be exclusively available for purchase starting July 27th for 7.99$ as a bundle that includes the Hero, one Ornament, one Elite Outfit, seven days of Champion Status and three scavenger crates. Players will also be able to unlock the hero starting August 10th for 15 000 Steel in-game. In addition to the Ocelotl and TU2 release, a free Event Pass: Hunt of the Ocelotl, will be available from February 2nd to February 23rd. Exclusive, limited-time rewards will be available during this time such as an ornament, effect, and more. PATCH NOTES In this Warrior's Den, we presented to you some of the changes that are going live at the launch of Y7S2 TU2, such as changes to Centurion, Jormungandr and Nuxia. We suggest you watch this segment of the show in the VOD. An article for the Patch Notes will be available on July 27th. Players can now “Group Dismantle” Gear in both the Reward and Scavenger Gear screens. This is a quality-of-life improvement that allows you to mark all the Gear, and then Dismantle them all at once (rather than individually as before) That’s it for this recap! Have fun with the release of Ocelotl and Y7S2 TU2 on July 27th, and we’ll see you next time for another recap!",1689887880,

304390,Patch Notes 2.44.0,"IMPROVEMENT ONBOARDING We've made changes to the Onboarding experience for new + existing players with the objective of streamlining and clarifying the Trials and provide a smoother bridge to multiplayer Major changes are: Essential knowledge is taught, and frustration elements are reduced throughout the Trials Apprentice Trials and Warrior Trials are now both part of the Onboarding flow All Trials are unlocked from the start (so you can skip if desired) Stamina Trial is cut (it is instead taught contextually when needed) Scoring and Secondary Objectives are removed (so it no longer tries to teach you to Guard Break after a Parry) Adding a PvAI Dominion match, with the intent of giving new players a way to get familiar with our main game mode (with the safety of fighting only Bots) Added a ""How To Play"" Dominion page at the start of this PvAI match Rewards: New players receive the rewards when all Trials are completed, including the PvAI Dominion match Existing players will still be able to receive any remaining rewards when they have completed all the Trials. This should be much easier (as without the Secondary Objectives, players don't have to win the 1v2 without getting hit) Developer's Notes: Please note that all rewards can only be received once if you previously received the Steel rewards you will not be eligible once again. FIGHTERS Nuxia Glass Waltz and Jade Ballet are now 300ms (down from 400ms) Heavy attacks now cancel to Glass Waltz at 500ms (up from 400ms) Zone Attack now cancels to Jade Ballet at 700ms (up from 600ms) Developer's Notes: Nuxia's changes to her Trap timings were found to be successful in the Y7S1 Testing Grounds, so now we integrate her changes into the Live game. The Testing Grounds showed that with these timings, players were unable to react to Traps, so this should be a strong boost to her core move set. Warden Side Heavy Finishers are now 800ms (down from 900ms) Side Heavy Finishers now have improved trajectories to help hit external opponents Shoulder Bash now can be done from 100ms-500ms into the front dodge (was 300ms - 500ms) Developer's Notes: Warden has been underperforming for a while, especially in group fights and at initiating offense in 1v1 scenarios. With these changes, the hero should be better equipped to hit opponents around them, as well as having a better way to get into Shoulder Bash from a front dodge. Hitokiri Opener Heavy Attacks now has Uninterruptable Stance beginning at 500ms at the earliest on the Uncharged Strike Opener Heavy Attacks now has a minimum charge time of 300ms (down from 400ms) This results in the hero's Heavy Openers to have a 700ms timing when not holding down the Heavy Attack button, down from 800ms Adjusted chain timings from Opener Heavy and Chained Heavy attacks to be from 200ms to 400ms (down from 366ms to 400ms) Adjusted Zone Attack's trajectory to better match weapon visuals Heavy Openers now deal 22 damage (from 24) Developer's Notes: Hitokiri has also been underperforming, and so we're doing some changes to help the hero get into their offense better. With Uninterruptible Stance on their Heavy Openers, we are hoping that Hitokiri is in a slightly better position as the hero should be safer when using these attacks to initiate offense. Their shorter minimum charge time should also help in making these attacks more potent. We've also adjusted the chain link timing after Heavy Attacks so that Hitokiri's chain offense comes out at a more reasonable timing, giving the hero better pressure. Finally, Hitokiri's Zone Attack should have better reach and hit opponents around better. Aramusha Blade Blockade now costs 10 Stamina on Entry (from 5) and 0 Stamina on Exit (from 10) Developer's Notes: Aramusha's Blade Blockade had an extra penalty on whiff that made it extra punishing, but also rewarded using the move as a recovery cancel too rewarding, so we decided to switch around the stamina costs a bit. Overall, this is a buff for the hero on miss, but a nerf on successful blocks, which should even out over time. Jormungandr Chain Zone can now be performed while Out of Lock Training Arena Added a new option for opponent Bots in the Training Arena, called ""No Block"". Intent is that players will be able to attack without the Bots Blocking BUG FIXES FIGHTERS Medjay Fixed an issue that caused Dodge Attack sound effect to not ends correctly if the attack was interrupted (FH-4276) CROSSPLAY Fixed an issue where players were unable to send group invites to accounts on a different platform with the same Ubisoft Connect account (Link to Bug Reporter Missing) MAP Fixed an issue that caused Players to go out of the map at Chapel area in Secluded Keep CUSTOMIZATION Fixed an issue that caused the Demonic Sacrifice idle effect to make the character look darker (FH-5419) Fixed an issue that caused the Berserker ""Varr Helm"" to not take color on Body Type 2 (FH-5318) Fixed an issue that caused the Warden chest piece ""Tranquil Wayfarer"" to be missing physic...",1686844897,['patchnotes']

What she found exceeded all rumors: vast cities of gold, the precious metal plentiful as mud. But this civilization would not suffer invasion so easily. They challenged the Conquistadors to fight at a set time and a place - an odd custom Vela pretended to agree to, before she ambushed them. Now the Horkos return in triumph. Obscene amounts of gold and treasure fill Vela's Castle. But her greatest prize of all is the enemy combatant she's captured: the strongest warrior from the New World. Many Horkos lives were lost in taking the prisoner. Kept caged and hidden, this spectacular fighter will soon be unveiled before Astrea for a public execution.

304390,Patch Notes 2.43.0 - For Honor,"Patch Notes 2.43.0 - For Honor PC: 2.0 Gb IMPROVEMENT FIGHTERS Valkyrie Shield Tackle Strike now deals 18 damage (down from 20) Shield Tackle now moves forward 0.5m less Shield Tackle no longer chains on Miss Chained Heavies now deal 26 damage (down from 27) Heavy Finishers now deal 28 damage (down from 30) Zone Attack is now 600ms (up from 500ms) Adjusted Zone Attack's weapon trajectories to have less reach and fixed their start and end positions Developer's Comment: Valkyrie has consistently been outperforming our expectations since her rework, so we are taking steps to lower her strengths. One notable change we want to explain further is Shield Tackle no longer chains on Miss: as the move is fully unreactable even at the top level, there is no real need to give the move even more safety. We will be keeping an eye on the hero and adjust further if necessary. Tiandi Light Finishers now deal 10 damage (down from 12) Top Tiger Dodge now deals 10 damage (down from 12) Dragon Kick Recovery on Miss is now 700ms (up from 600ms) Dragon Kick Follow-up now deals 20 damage (down from 24) Heavy Finishers now deal 28 damage (down from 30 damage) The first hit of Zone Attack now causes a Medium hit reaction (instead of a Heavy hit reaction) Opener Light and Heavies now chain to Light and Heavy Finishers on Miss from 200ms to 300ms (instead of from 100ms to 300ms for when locked and 100ms to 400ms when Out of Lock) All versions of Tiger Dodge and Dragon Dodge now chain to Light and Heavy Finishers on Miss from 200ms to 300ms (instead of from 100ms to 300ms) Developer's Comment:* Tiandi has also been outperforming our expectations since their rework - we are also taking steps to lower their strengths to be less frustrating to fight against.* We will be keeping an eye on the hero and adjust further if necessary. Kensei Top Heavy Finisher Miss Recovery is now 700ms (down from 1300ms) Side Heavy Finisher Miss Recoveries are now 700ms (down from 1100ms) Developer's Comment:* Kensei was too vulnerable when using their Heavy Finishers; with these new recoveries on miss, the hero should be able to use these attacks with more potency, especially when target swapping them.* Shugoki Heavy Finisher Miss Recoveries are now 700ms (down from 1000ms) Heavy Finishers now gain Uninterruptible Stance at 100ms Developer's Comment:* Similarly to Kensei, missing with Shugoki's Heavy Finishers made the hero too vulnerable, so we significantly reduced their recovery timings to make them safer in group fights.* With the change to Dodge Attacks, we are also now in a position to give Shugoki back their Uninterruptible Stance on Heavy Finishers; they were problematic when you could chain Side Dodge Headbutts on Miss, as Shugoki was able to use them defensively, and even on a correct read their opponents were unable to punish them with Dodge Attacks. Since this ability is gone, we can confidently give the property back at full strength. Shaman Heavy Finisher Miss Recoveries are now 700ms (down from 1000ms) Developer's Comment: Like Kensei and Shugoki, Shaman was left open for too long when missing her Heavy Finishers, especially in group fights. This should let her use them more effectively. Centurion Zone Attack now costs 9 Stamina for each Strike (down from 12) Adjusted weapon trajectories for Zone Attack strikes to better match the weapon visuals Developer's Comment: We're adjusting Centurion's Zone Attack to cost less Stamina as well as have better Weapon Trajectories to ensure the move is better usable in outnumbered situations. Warmonger Side Heavy Openers and Finishers have had their trajectories adjusted to better match the weapon visuals. Gryphon Side Light Openers, Chained and Finishers have had their trajectories adjusted to better match the weapon visuals Side Heavy Openers, Chained and Finishers have had their trajectories adjusted to better match the weapon visuals PC Improved CPU usage to better leverage total CPU availability when allocating tasks BUG FIXES FIGHTERS Raider Fixed an issue that allowed Raider to chain a Zone Attack after going Out of Stamina when leaving Guard Mode (FH-5005) Nobushi Fixed an issue that caused Nobushi dodges forward into Viper's Retreat to perfom a Light Attack in some situations (FH-4671) Aramusha Fixed an issue that caused Aramusha's weapon trail visual effect to be out of sync with the attack animation when performing a Left Side Deadly Feint from a Right Side Heavy Finisher (FH-4796) Tiandi Fixed an issue that caused Tiandi Palm Strike to switch Guard to Top after a whiff and also caused the duration before a guard change to be higher (FH-5122) Gryphon Fixed an issue that caused Gryphon to be missing Top Bad Block animation (FH-5204) Nuxia Fixed an issue that caused Nuxia ""Glass Waltz"" to dash erratically in the direction of the player's movement (FH-5311) SOUND Fixed an issue that caused Kyoshin executions sound effects to be sometimes missing in Breach VS AI (FH-5046) CUSTOMIZATION Fixed an issue...",1683129713,['patchnotes']

The rework focuses on replacing the hero's game plan from draining your opponent's Stamina to displacing your opponents to get the upper hand. To do so, we've added a few new moves to the hero's arsenal, moved some attacks around to give the hero better openers as well as better flow while in chains. These changes should help the hero reach their full potential and perform better in today's metagame. Stamina-based gameplay removal Moves no longer unbalance opponents in Out of Stamina state Moves no longer deal Stamina damage Moves no longer pause Stamina regeneration Displacement-based gameplay NEW MOVE: Venomous Sting Input: After landing a Guardbreak, press Heavy in any stance 800ms, deals 12 damage, costs 12 Stamina Pushes opponents backwards on hit and can wall splat Heavy Finishers Top Heavy Finisher now pushes opponents backwards Heavy Finishers now push opponents further away Top Heavy Finisher now deals 24 damage, down from 30 Side Heavy Finishers now deal 22 damage, down from 29 Heavy Openers Top Heavy Opener now deals 22 damage, down from 27 Side Heavy Openers now deal 20 damage, down from 24 Top Heavy Opener is now 800ms, down from 900ms Flow improvements NEW MOVE: Ouroboros Might Input: Light + Heavy Attack during chains 800ms, deals 24 damage, costs 12 Stamina Can be feinted Can be performed after any attack except itself, Venomous Sting and Hamarr Slam Initiates Chains Gains Uninterruptible Stance at 100ms Jotunn Gift Now deals 10 Health damage Jotunn Farewell New animation Now always unbalances opponents on hit Now 800ms, up from 500ms Can now be feinted Hamarr Slam No longer has Uninterruptible Stance Now deals 30 damage, down from 38 Now has 1400ms of recovery on hit, down from 1500ms Quality of Life improvements Jotunn Surge Reworked animation Input changed to Front Dodge + Guardbreak Attack speed is now 500ms, down from 600ms No longer chains on Miss Light Openers Reworked animations Improved trajectories Increased forward movement Light Finishers No longer Undodgeable Serpent Smite Attack Speed is now 800ms, down from 1000ms Damage is now 22, down from 26 Gains Uninterruptible Stance at 400ms during the attack, down from 600ms Improved Chain Link Timings Chain Link timings are improved for the following attacks: Light Openers Heavy Openers Serpent Smite Serpent Coil Strike Jotunn Gift GLOBAL Dodge Changes As we have tested in a previous Testing Grounds, we're adjusting Dodges and Dodge Attacks to be more in-line with how we are pushing gameplay forward. We want defensive Dodge Attacks to be higher risk moves so that players are not overly incentivized to use them to defend themselves; while they are still good defensive options, they should now be riskier to use, and require a read on the defender's part, especially when used against feintable attacks. We've also heard your feedback that some of the changes felt bad on slow, feintable dodge attacks, and as such for the three heroes that have these types of Side Dodge attacks (Jiang Jun, Tiandi and Warmonger) they will not grant the same punish as for the faster ones. Side Dodge Heavy attacks Non-feintable Side Dodge Heavy attacks now act as Light attacks when parried Jiang Jun, Tiandi and Warmonger's Side Dodge Heavy attacks still act as Heavy attacks when parried Delayable Side Dodge Attacks Most side Dodge attacks are now able to be performed from 200ms to 400ms during Side Dodges The following heroes have different timings for their Side Dodge attacks Jiang Jun: Mighty Backlash is 300ms to 500ms Tiandi: Tiger Dodge is 100ms to 300ms, Dragon Dodge is 200ms to 300ms Warden: Shoulder Bash is 300ms to 500ms Warmonger: Both Beast of Prey and Preying Claw are 300ms to 500ms Side Dodge Bashes vulnerability The following Side Dodge Bashes were changed: Conqueror's Shield Bash (used as a Side Dodge Attack) Now 600ms, up from 533ms Miss recovery is now 800ms, up from 700ms Gladiator's Sucker Punch (used as a Side Dodge attack) No longer chains on miss Lawbringer's Shove (used as a Side Dodge attack) Miss recovery is now 700ms Shinobi: Reaper's Dance Miss recovery is now 700ms, up from 600ms Shugoki's Headbutt (used as a Side Dodge attack) Now 600ms, up from 533ms Miss recovery is now 700ms, up from 600ms No longer chains on miss Defense while dodging Non-Reflex Guard heroes no longer have regular Block while dodging in any direction, regardless of if the stance is forced or not, for most of the duration of the dodge Heroes regain t...",1678991196,['patchnotes']
304390,Warrior’s Den Recap,"Warrior’s Den Recap, March 10th 2023 7 Min Read March 16th marks the start of For Honor’s 7th year and the launch of Y7S1: Heresy In this Warrior’s Den recap article, we’ll quickly go over some of the Year 7 details covered in the live stream and the Y7S1 Heresy’s TU1 Update. For a detailed discussion on Year 7: Swords of Injustice, and Y7S1: Heresy, be sure to check out the Warrior’s Den VOD to see what is to come. In the show, we went into detail on the patch notes and Y7S1 Testing Grounds. For a detailed blog post on the Testing Grounds topics for Y7S1, keep an eye out for an upcoming Testing Grounds dedicated blog post as we near the opening of the Testing Grounds for the season. For Honor Year 7: Swords of Injustice After a year of revelations about the past (and future) of Heathmoor comes a veil of darkness. Ancient relics were uncovered, magical myths revealed. Now, knowledge has been weaponized. Faith has been turned into a sharp blade, and the Order of Horkos firmly grasps the handle. The Year of Injustice begins as the wretched, the vile and the nefarious launch a reign of torment. This is the year where evil wins, where the boot of Horkos stomps the lands. Heroes cower in fear and uncertainty as the shadow grows. Who will be left to balance the scales? https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7xfNPRMNmuVnHGCW2LDGxJ/0297cf959a5378fe2e6c96544f1d7323/FH_WarriorsDenRecapY7S1_img1.jpg In Year 7: Swords of injustice, each season will explore a different injustice taking place in Heathmoor. Players can expect 2 New Heroes, 4 Hero Skins, Battle Passes, Free Event Passes, a Halloween event and other calendar events, Throwback events, Thesting Grounds, Hero Fests, and more to be revealed as Y7 is rolled out. https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/61SNz5glk7GT7IWQCWUEjf/b5a26ee0a51e0ea5dacc5938063446dc/FH_WarriorsDenRecapY7S1_img2.png For Year 7, players can expect 3 Hero Fests each TU starting with Y7S1 TU1. Additionally, the Hero featured in the Hero Fest will enjoy double XP and will be free to play during the duration of the fest. For armor variations, this year we’ll have each faction receiving 2 armor variations for their heroes, coming in TU2 each season. Here is the plan: Y7S1: Knight and Samurai Armor Variations Y7S2: Viking, Wu Lin, and Outlanders Armor Variations Y7S3: Knight and Samurai Armor Variations Y7S4: Viking, Wu Lin, and Outlanders Armor Variations https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6n0cNcuMTxCsomfbRWuTdx/2a4861601bc22274755e5353d1f921fb/FH_WarriorsDenRecapY7S1_img3.jpg Y7S1 Heresy The relics were supposed to unite Heathmoor. Instead, madmen began to rave about their legends as divine revelation. Soon every place of worship came to be occupied by the fanatical Servants of the Stake. Whispers spread of the dark deeds committed in the name of their twisted faith. In answer, the Relic Inquisition was formed. Their mission: purge all heresy. Yinchen joined the Inquisition with a righteous heart. A Pirate, she had seen firsthand how civilizations fall to false idols. Executing Fanatics was the price for peace. But the Inquisition was not content to merely pluck weeds – and Yinchen found herself party to mass butcherings worse than anything the Servants had done. Now Inquisitor Yinchen cries mutiny. To end the war of faith, she must fight not one army, but two. https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7fT28SmRZkaOladNzckLJ3/228540f512323e93cd3efa4ead7a2eb9/FH_WarriorsDenRecapY7S1_img4.jpg In For Honor’s Y7S1 Heresy, our TU1 offer includes the Heresy of the Relics launch event along a free event pass, an all-new Battle Pass, the Pirate Hero Skin Inquisitor Yinchen, Testing Grounds, 3 Hero Fests. In TU2, players can expect a Throwback event, new armor variations, a returning playlist, the Covenant Games: Heralds of Chimera recurring event for one last time, and 3 more Hero Fests. https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/wyRcDjUkMM4FuYhr47LNn/2cf9a6c4adc6a6d2995f10e6696aa878/FH_WarriorsDenRecapY7S1_img5.jpg Launch Event: Heresy of the Relics The war of faith will be decided at Relic Keep. The Inquisition now marches on the castle, where the Fanatics have gathered three relics and prepare to make their last stand. Each side vies for control of the artifacts in the age-old battle of dominion. But Inquisitor Yinchen is a rogue element neither expected – and she will strike at both armies in her bid for the relics. https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/77sEuCfOocEXbBnKREFu6v/68cc81d52f6604085613095081db2de2/FH_WarriorsDenRecapY7S1_img6.jpg From March 16 to April 6, participate in For Honor’s Y7S1 launch event “Heresy of the Relics” which will feature a unique game mode.

304390,FOR HONOR PATCH NOTES 2.38.0,"PATCH NOTES 2.38.0 1.6 Gb IMPROVEMENTS New Side Dodge Attacks The following heroes now have Side Dodge Attacks: Warlord Centurion Highlander Black Prior Jormungandr For each hero except Highlander, these new Dodge Attacks are performed by pressing the Light Attack button (Highlander uses the Heavy Attack button). In addition, they are all 600ms, performed at 300ms in the Side Dodge, and have appropriate iframes. They also all act as chain openers, and chain into what their neutral Light attacks chain into. Developer's Comment: With this pass, every hero in the game now has a Side Dodge attack, giving them tools to punish bashes. With the exception of Highlander, we've purposefully given these heroes Side Dodge attacks that are not optimal; they are intended to punish bashes, but should be risky in other situations, and are not meant to be used as good tools during group fights. Highlander is a special case where the hero's Defensive Stance was underperforming in these situations, and we wanted to make sure the hero was able to defend himself in outnumbered situations; the other heroes already have strong tools to defend themselves, and as such Highlander needed a better Side Dodge attack to compensate. (Quick extra note: 26/31 heroes already had a Dodge Attack. It's become clear that Dodge Attack is a mandatory tool in a For Honor fighter's toolkit, so the lack of Dodge Attacks on these 5 fighters wasn't built to help their 'uniqueness', but it's clear it was leaving them unable to function at all in certain situations.) Fighter Improvements Developer's Comment: We're doing a pass on multiple heroes to give them Quality of Life as well as Balancing changes - many of these heroes have small tweaks, but others have bigger changes that should help bring them to a better state. We'll keep an eye on how these changes affect the meta. Fighters Warden Zone Attack Stamina cost is now 30, down from 60 Second Light Attacks in chain are now 500ms, down from 600ms Developer's Comment: These changes should help both reduce Warden's stamina costs as standardize Warden's chained Light attacks to a more standard speed. Peacekeeper Dagger Cancel can now cancel its recovery to a dodge from 200ms to 300ms (from static at 333ms) Dashing Thrust can now be performed from 200ms to 500ms during a Front Dodge (was static at 300ms) Bleed Stabs (Guardbreak Followups) now do a total of 28 damage (down from 38) All Guardbreak Throws now have 200ms less recovery Side and Back Guardbreak Throws can now be cancelled by a Dodge in their last 100ms Front Guardbreak Throw can now be cancelled by a Dodge in the last 300ms Increased forward movement on the following attacks: Light Openers and Chained Lights Heavy Openers and Finishers Updated Trajectory for Zone Attack's first strike Crossbow feat now deals 15 damage + 10 Bleed damage over 10 seconds, from 25 flat damage. Developer's Comment: We're tweaking some part of Peacekeeper's kit - Dagger Cancel should now be able to be used in a safer manner and should give the hero better options when it lands. The changes to Dashing Thrust as well as Guard break Throws should enable Peacekeeper to land Dashing Thrust consistently when wall splatting. Her Zone Attack's first strike trajectory has also been updated to be more consistent with its animation. Finally, all her neutral and chained attacks now have better forward movement, giving the hero more mobility in group fights as well as in 1v1 scenarios. We have also lowered the damage Peacekeeper deals on Guard breaks to a more standard level, especially considering the new changes to wall splats, giving her more interesting options. Finally, her Crossbow feat now has extra utility by applying Bleed, opening up more of her kit. Lawbringer Increased forward movement of all Light attacks by 0.25m Increased forward movement of all side Heavy attacks by 0.25m Updated the trajectories of all Side Heavy attacks to better match the weapon strikes Increased input window for Parry followups by 66ms Impaling Riposte from Parry is now 800ms, down from 900ms Developer's Comment: We've focused our changes on Lawbringer to address issues related to the hero's movement and weapon trajectories; with these changes, Lawbringer should have a bit more mobility during team fights, but more importantly the new weapon trajectories should greatly help with the weapon not hitting external targets. We've also done a pass to ensure Lawbringer's Parry followups are easier to perform with a larger input window. Warlord Updated Board and Blade's trajectory to better match the weapon strike Increased forward movement of Board and Blade by 1m Zone Attack now costs 30 Stamina, down from 60 Developer's Comment: Warlord's Board and Blade was lacking in that while the move is Undodgeable, its trajectory wasn't matching the weapon correctly and the move was lacking forward movement to be able to properly catch opponents who were dodging or rolling away. In addition, we've adjusted th...",1663262038,['patchnotes']
304390,Crossplay Phase 2,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/64c0158b65c07bea24cc04450a35e4833e1976c4.jpg Crossplay Phase 2 is coming October 20th. Phase 2 will allow our players to group and play with cross platform friends. Previously in Phase 1, players were limited to crossplay through matchmaking only. This means you could not add friends from different platforms and play with them. With the implementation of Phase 2, players will be able to group with their friends from any platform. In Y6S3 TU1, we are implementing voice-chat in crossplay matches, a new block-list feature and removing P2P connection. 1. What is Phase 2 of Crossplay? Crossplay Phase 2's functionality will extend to group play with your cross-platform friends and/or players. Your friends' platform of choice will no longer be a blocker when looking to play together. You will be able to group with other online players under the same Ubisoft account (also called linked profiles), which allows players having played the game on more than 1 platform under the same Ubisoft account to play together. However, progression is still isolated per platform, as there is no cross-progression. 2. Do I need a specific Ubisoft account to play For Honor? Yes, if you play on console it is mandatory to link your console account to a Ubisoft Account to play For Honor. If you do not have a Ubisoft account, the game will ask you to create one at the first launch. If you have already played For Honor, you already have a Ubisoft Account. 3. How do I add a cross-platform friend? Open Ubisoft Connect on any device or via the in-game shortcuts found in the ""Group"" or ""Customize"" tabs. Then, cycle to the friends' tab and search for your friends' Ubisoft Connect username. If you are already in a match or group, you can also simply view the player's profile and select ""Send Friend Request"". 4. How do I find my Ubisoft Connect username? It should be visible on the ""Profile"" tab in Ubisoft Connect. You can also see it be selecting your own profile in the Group menu. 5. How do I accept a friend request? Open Ubisoft Connect on any device or via the in-game shortcuts found in the ""Group"" or ""Customize"" tabs. Then, cycle to the friends' tab and view your pending friend requests. For more information on Ubisoft Connect, see : Link on PC : https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/account/article/add-more-ubisoft-connect-friends/000077468 6. How do I play with friends that are on another platform? The process is the same as it was previously. Players need to become friends on Ubisoft connect first. Then you simply head to the groups tab and invite your friends through the friends list. 7. Will the matchmaking system be readjusted at the launch of Phase 2 on October 20th, 2022? No, there is no need to readjust the matchmaking system as the implementation of Phase 2 only adds the ability to add cross platform friends as well as play with them. 8. Will in game communication change with Crossplay Phase 2? To deploy Phase 2, voice-chat in Crossplay matches will be introduced at the beginning of Y6S3 TU1. Additionally, all players can still use the quick-chat messages to communicate with their teammates. PC players can use standard text chat as well. 9. Can I disable Voice Chat? Yes, you can mute individual users using the ""Mute voice"" option on their player card. As a reminder, consoles have built-in cross-platform preferences. If our users are experiencing problems with Cross-play or Cross-platform voice chat, they should verify their current preferences. For more information, players should refer to their console's user guide for more information. 10. Which game modes will not support Crossplay? Story Mode (Coop) & Arcade Mode (Coop). All other game modes are supported for Crossplay. 11. How do I opt out of Crossplay? Players can opt out of cross-play by going to Options > Online > Cross-play. Opting out of crossplay is not recommended as matchmaking queue's will be much longer. 12. Do I still need to configure my router with open NAT (green NAT)? No, with the release of Y6S3 TU1 on September 15th, we are completely removing all remaining P2P connections into the game. This means that we do not show the NAT status in game anymore and this configuration is not required anymore. All connections are now transferred on Servers. Take note that with the transfer of custom matches on dedicated servers we cannot support Nvidia Ansel technology in this game mode. We are investigating how to re-integrate such a feature later. 13. What is the new in-game block list? With the release of Y6S3 TU1 on September 15th, we are releasing a new tool to enhance the management of friends in game. You will also be able to blacklist other users to reduce the toxicity. When blocking other users, their voice chat and text chat will automatically be muted in game if encountered. Additionally, it will remove the emblem's visual of the blocked player. You can also easily block and unblock friends from the player card activity. With the release o...",1663258826,

Something has awakened in the Myre. For centuries, a cavern at the heart of the swamps was sealed off until a fissure split open. Ancient Samurai once knew the truth of the cave, but the echo of their warnings had faded across the ages to a whisper. It was a prison. Now demons, once banished to the bowels of the earth, have escaped. And after their long, unholy hibernation, the Yokai hunger. Motoori noticed small signs first. The young Orochi was the first to warn of the villagers' strange behavior. Honorable Nobushi babbled and cursed. Aramusha bent and twisted impossibly. At length, the eyes of the Samurai took on pale glows - the last mutation before their massacre on Temple Garden. By then the Yokai's possession was complete. To save the survivors, Motoori told them of another fable: the Mamono Dagger, a mythical blade said to trap spirits of the Yokai. But the demon dagger bears a terrible cost... and none are worse cut than its wielder.

The day the Cataclysm struck the world, the flourishing kingdom of Egypt collapsed. Its once mighty landmarks were destroyed, swallowed by earth, water and sand. Its significant achievements were forgotten, and its thriving people, no more. But not all was lost. The Medjay are the last survivors of this lost civilization. Warriors once tasked with protecting their homeland, they are now the keepers of their culture. The deserts they call home are filled with lost riches, and the Medjay have long fought back adventurers, explorers and would-be treasure hunters. With no throne left to defend, the Medjay evolved into something else. Outside of the confines of their old responsibilities, the warriors developed a new, dual-wielding fighting style as they embraced a more offensive approach. With the path to Heathmoor now open to them, the Medjay see a new land in dire need of guardianship. Driven by integrity and honor, these warriors have a strong moral compass that never points toward corruption and dishonesty. They are willing to sacrifice everything to enforce what they believe is right - no matter where they are, or who they choose to fight for. Medjay joins Pirate Queen as the second Outlander Hero in For Honor! The Hero will come with two sets, will be exclusively available for purchase starting July 28th for 7.99$ as a bundle that includes the Hero, one Ornament, one Elite Outfit, seven days of Champion Status and three scavenger crates.

He left his homeland to chase the Raider, following the relic’s trail of waste and death to its heart in Valkenheim. There Neferkha found Bolthorn, a cursed shell of his former self. An epic battle ensued – with Neferkha ultimately besting his friend. Rather than killing the Viking, Neferkha spared his life and removed the Bracelet to lift the curse. Having witnessed the relic’s destruction, Neferkha had realized the jewel belonged to a different time and place; it was simply to dangerous, even for himself, the last heir of the Pharaohs. The Medjay left Valkenheim so it might begin to heal. He became a mercenary to buy his way back home, where he would return the Bracelet to its resting place. Difficulty: Hard Weapon Transform Dual Fighting Styles Good Melee Range in Staff Mode Special Capabilities Unique dual utility feats Unstoppable infinite chain in Staff mode High aggression and speed in Axes mode Stays in current mode when hit, unlike other multi-mode heroes IMPROVEMENTS Match End Flow All screens shown after completing a match have been redesigned for improved legibility, clearer progression information, and with less disruptive animations so it is quicker to reach the options for the next match. NEW OPTION: Deactivate the Parry Flash Indicator (in Arena, and all Custom Match Game Modes) Players can now deactivate the Parry Flash Indicator, which usually flashes at the correct timing to Parry an attack, in the Arena as well as during Custom Games. This option appears in the Arena under “Arena -> Arena Settings -> Parry Flash Indicator”, and in the Custom Game Match under “Custom Game -> Game Mode -> Parry Flash Indicator” Developer's Comment: Competitive players in the Dominion Series have been requesting this option for some time. Adding this option is meant to reduce the efficiency of players who have exceptional reaction times and to limit certain kinds of cheats. We specifically add this as an Option only in Custom Games and Arena so that competitive play can intentionally remove the parry flash to improve the level of offense in their games. Normal matchmaking games continue to have the Parry Flash to help players learn the sense of timing to Parry attacks. Out Of Stamina (OOS) State is now less punishing Stamina Pause no longer applies on players who are Out of Stamina Stamina is now fully refilled when getting up from the Unbalanced state Developer's Comment: Previously, players in the OOS could conceivably be forced to stay in that state until killed. If your opponent had a quick Dodge Forward Bash attack, they could continually bash you to keep your stamina from ever refilling, while slowly killing you and limiting your options. By removing Stamina Pause while OOS, you should be able to get out of OOS more reliably, which should be less frustrating. Similarly, we’ve now given back full Stamina whenever you get up from the Unbalanced state. The intent is that if you’ve been unbalanced, the opponent should have a single good opportunity for a punish, but not more than one. Out of Stamina punishes are typically the highest damaging punishes available – while we want players to have an opportunity for a big punish when their opponent overextends, the reward could be larger than intended when the opponent remained Out of Stamina and could be unbalanced for another large punish. This change should address this concern and make becoming Out of Stamina less frustrating. Improvement to Targetable Feats thrown at a Locked target who is Dodging or has the Stealth feat active Targetable Feats are no longer affected by Stealth and should correctly track opponents who have the Stealth feat active Targetable Feats now track Dodging opponents better, especially Grenade-type feats, which could be thrown off-target by a large amount. Developer's Comment: We’re changing how Targetable Feats interact with Stealth and Dodging opponents to make the feats more consistent. When an opponent had Stealth active, Targetable Feats would miss at moments where they did not feel like they should (ie. Your opponent was walking sideways). This makes the Feats more consistent in their tracking of Stealth opponents and no longer have Stealth be a hard counter to Targetable Feats. Similarly, some Targetable feats, such as Grenade-type feats, had a tracking issue when used against a Dodging opponent, where they would land in unexpected locations. With this change, they should land as expected at the opponent even if they Dodge. Targetable Feats are still able to be Dodged, but the result of the feats should be more consistent with the anticipated behavior.

304390,For Honor CROSSPLAY FAQ,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/bed050b768a04105311a7e9181d35ca2dadac9ec.png For Honor CROSSPLAY FAQ We are excited to announce that Crossplay is coming to For Honor on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Crossplay will be implemented in 2 phases, with Phase 1 being introduced on March 17th. Crossplay has been an ambition of our team for a very long time. There have been many technical challenges to bring Crossplay to For Honor because the core technical game components were not originally designed to support it. Thanks to the hard work of the team, we are now proud to bring Crossplay to our Warriors. We believe Crossplay will benefit For Honor and its long-term vision. Below, we answer some questions you might have concerning For Honor’s Crossplay and its deployment. How will Crossplay be deployed in For Honor? Crossplay will be deployed in 2 Phases in For Honor. Phase 1 will launch on March 17th 2022, along side the launch of Y6S1: Golden Age. The launch of Phase 2 will happen at a later date as it is currently under development. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/bed050b768a04105311a7e9181d35ca2dadac9ec.png What is Phase 1 of Crossplay? In Phase 1, Crossplay will be enabled for matchmaking for PVP and PVE modes, unifying the 3 player pools for all PC, Playstation, and Xbox players. What are the benefits of Crossplay Phase 1? With Phase 1 unifying the 3 player pools into 1, players should see an improvement in their matchmaking time, and have a better For Honor experience for online multiplayer game sessions. Will the matchmaking system readjust at the launch of Phase 1? Yes, when Phase 1 comes into effect, player skill ratings must be reset to use the new unified player pools and create balanced matchmaking matches. It will take a few games to re-calibrate your personal skill rating. As a result, Crossplay may connect you with players of varying skill for the first few games after its deployment. Will in-game communication be affected by Crossplay Phase 1? Due to technical constraints ingame voice chat will be have to be disabled for all Crossplay matches. We do have plans to reintroduce voice chat for Crossplay matches at a later date. PC users will still be able to use the free text chat fuction and any messages from it will only be visible by other PC players. Console users will still have access to quick text options and will be visible by all players regardless of platform. What is Phase 2 of Crossplay? In Phase 2, Crossplay functionality will extend to group play with your cross-platform friends and/or players. Your friends’ platform of choice will no longer be a blocker when looking to play together. More on how this will work when Phase 2 will be announced. Why is Crossplay being deployed in 2 phases and not all together? Phase 1 was ready to be deployed and we expect it to have a positive impact on the players’ matchmaking experience and therefore felt no need to delay its release for alignment with group play intended in Phase 2. Which modes include Crossplay? Crossplay will include PVP and PVE game modes, excluding Campaign Mode, Training Mode, Custom Match (Phase 1 only), Arcade Mode, and Rank Mode. Can I Disable Crossplay? Yes. On March 17th, Crossplay will be automatically enabled for all players. Players will still have the option to opt out of Crossplay should they wish. Don’t forget that if you opt-out for Crossplay you might experience higher wait times for matchmaking and lower quality of matches. How do I opt out Crossplay? You can opt out Crossplay in the Settings Menu under the new 'Online' option. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/b3de1229eea2ff5938e295b3832cda68067c3607.png ",1647366377,
304390,For Honor Year 6: Lost Horizons,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/049ad5193d35b9b3a88356b7739afbc73a052eaa.jpg Hello Warriors, As we head into the final chapter of For Honor’s Year 5: Year of Covenants, we know that many of you may have been waiting to know more about what’s next. Today, we are really happy to announce that For Honor will be back with another year of new content with Year 6: Lost Horizons, starting March 17th. For more than 5 years, we have had the opportunity to try new things, improve and evolve with you, our community, while staying true to For Honor’s identity. As we conclude Year 5, we are really excited to experience with you what we have in store for the upcoming year. Without further ado, here's a sneak peek of what to expect for Year 6: Lost Horizons. More information will follow as we get closer to the launch of Year 6 Season 1. Stay tuned! Year 6: Lost Horizons In Year 6, the world of For Honor is getting bigger and it starts with the arrival of a new group of heroes presented in Y5S4, the Outlanders. Venturing from the outside, the Outlanders will view the For Honor world under a new lense but also impact Heathmoor with novel forms of combat and cultures. The first of this group, the Pirate, bring with them multiple relics they have collected across their different travels. These relics will uncover these lost horizons and forgotten mythologies of Heathmoor. These relics will be unveiled one by one each season and will help push the boundaries of new themes that will be explored. Unlike previous years, the Year 6 narrative will not necessarily unfold in chronological order. You can expect a first glimpse as we get closer to March 17 once Year 6: Lost Horizons begins. Four Unique Seasons and Two New Outlander Heroes joining the battlefield Similarly to Year 5, Year 6 will have four unique Seasons and two new heroes. Both of them will be part of the new group, the Outlanders. The first new hero will be released in Y6S2 TU2, and the second hero in Y6S4 TU2. Both will bring new elements of combat that differ from the existing factions and we can't wait to see your reaction to how they will shake up the battlefield. For more details about the Outlanders, you can check out our special FAQ article. Seasonal cosmetics and a new customization option: Hero Skins Along with existing offers such as new unique battle passes each season, themed armor and weapon variations, content of the week; Starting in Y6S1, we will be adding a new customization option to the mix: Hero Skins. Hero Skins will be a new option in the hero appearance customization tab. Here, players will be able to select any Hero Skins that are available to the hero that they are looking to customize. But what are they? Hero Skins are top-to-bottom designs that affect every element of a hero’s appearance harmoniously. With these full-set designs we can push the boundaries of all the elements composing the hero’s customization and push the fantasy of their identity even more. This includes armor, weapon, body type, skin, facial features in novel ways, and we cannot wait to show you what it looks like! For Year 6, we are aiming to release one hero skin per season for a single hero within the current For Honor roster. When equipped, the Hero Skin will override the customization and body type you already have on your hero while Perks will remain unchanged. You cannot dismantle Hero Skins but some customization elements can be changed such as Color Palettes and Materials. The Hero Skin is an additional option for the player to customize their hero. It is important to mention that the traditional customization system remains. The Hero Skins can be purchased anytime with Steel or in stores upon their release. We will give you more details about the Hero Skins and the season itself in March 2022. Fight: Core Experience With a total of 30 playable heroes and two new ones on their way, we will continue working on hero balancing and fight system improvements to give the best gameplay experience to the community. Of course, we will also bring back and continue prioritizing Testing Grounds for each season. This has been an amazing tool that has helped us connect with you and have a more direct line to your feedback. This has and will continue to help shape the For Honor experience as we head into Year 6. Competitive The competitive scene was a pillar we expanded on in Year 5, where we introduced a new year-long format to our competitive program: the Dominion Series. Our plan for Year 6 is to continue supporting and expanding the competitive scene as much as possible, whether it is for experienced competitors of the program or new players looking to break into it. More details on Year 6’s competitive program will be shared at a later date. Don’t miss the Dominion Series Finals that will be held on February 12 that will conclude this full competitive year. Here, the winners For Honor 2021 Dominion Series Regional Champions will be crowned. More details to come That’s all we hav...",1642717048,
304390,FAQ - Outlanders,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/31dbdef66a22b33314dbe853bb02a8138d026a1e.png Who are they? Where are they from? The Outlanders are a group of heroes who hail from lands far from Heathmoor not many people know of. They are not part of the traditional factions (Viking, Samurai, Knights, and Wu Lin). The Outlanders are free adventurers who have no cultural links between each other. They fight for those who are loyal to them or who pay them well. Presented in Year 5 Season 4 in Title Update 2, the Outlanders are introduced by the first hero of this group, the Pirate. The Pirate will defend their loot and treasures to the death. Do the Outlanders have an emblem? Yes, the Outlanders have their own emblem. Below you can see the new emblem of this group of heroes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/7165f5886a5c653e715f91682522cca72587b604.png First, we added elements representing their mindset and the common goal they share, such as a compass and a sextant. Being part of the For Honor world, we have not forgotten to add a dagger in the middle of the emblem. All these elements and colors combined to represent the traveling and fighting side of the Outlanders. Why are we adding this group to For Honor? The arrival of the Outlanders allows us the opportunity to expand the choice of cultures we can explore when creating new heroes and in-game realization. This will bring more diversity to For Honor and allow us to tell stories that were not possible with the existing factions. Are they a new faction? What makes them different from the other factions? We don’t consider the Outlanders as a traditional faction since, unlike Viking, Samurai, Knights and Wu Lin, they will hardly share cultural similarities. This is done on purpose, to allow ourselves a greater liberty for the future of the game. The Outlanders will also not be taking part in the Faction War because they are adventurers who are not interested in settling down and conquering new land. Y5S4’s new hero, the Pirate, resembles the Wu Lin in culture. Why are they part of the Outlanders group and not the Wu Lin? In our story, the Pirate hero will be shaking things up for this season and serves as a segue (or as a Trojan Horse, if you prefer) to introduce the Outlanders. As explorers and adventurers, they are the ones who will bring the relics, and they will establish a connection between Heathmoor and this new group of Heroes…. The Pirate seems to have an ascendance to the Wu Lin. Does this mean that new heroes will also have ascendance such as Viking, Samurai, Knights or Wu Lin? Not necessarily. With the Outlanders, the goal is to introduce something new, to expand the choice of heroes and bring different cultures and backgrounds in Heathmoor.",1642715615,

Under a scorching sun, the factions of Heathmoor long fought for water. But what was once scarce then came in overwhelming abundance. The unbearable heat of the drought melted the glaciers of Valkenheim and as a result, the water levels rose dangerously. Torrential rains and violent winds fell upon Heathmoor, with no end to the storm in sight. With the home they once knew overrun with water, warriors found themselves out of their element. All except the Vikings, for whom the storm had brought about rebirth… and an opportunity to reign supreme. The aforementioned themes are strongly represented in Y5S3 Tempest’s in-game realization and seasonal customization. For more information about the season, continue reading. We’ll go over the Storm Tides event, this season’s Battle Pass, everything regarding the Testing Grounds and more. Stay tuned for new armor variations and maybe some other surprises for Y5S3 TU2. Lastly, for this season, we are excited to announce that, at launch, all heroes will be receiving a unique execution. For detailed discussion of the season and what’s to come with the For Honor Dev Team, be sure to check out the Warrior’s Den VOD to see what’s to come on September 9th at launch Y5S3: Tempest.

As safe land became a rare commodity, the animosity between warriors only intensified. Starting on season Launch until September 30th, players will be able to play through a Free Event Pass and gain access to a multitude of rewards such as a new Battle Outfit, an Effect as well as an Ornament. During the event there will also be new weapons available for players to loot. Battle Pass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/e550afca9ccbcf1237fa6bfe1dba6785b019f821.jpg The coming of unending rains led the Vikings to believe that Aegir and Ran, the deities of the sea, were listening. Legends said that the married couple ruled over the oceans, and that their generosity came from offerings. For Chimera, this meant honoring Ran by respecting nature. But Aegir demanded blood… and Horkos were more than happy to provide. These themes make a strong impact in this season’s Battle Pass. It is now possible to dress your warriors with gear that will remind you of Norse divinity or to wear the jewels of the ocean. Gear up for the storm with the Y5S3 Battle Pass. Get 100 tiers of rewards for all heroes to unlock new weapons and effects. Premium rewards include Tempest themed outfits, effects, weapons, a battle points boost from completed matches, 11K steel and more. This Y5S3 Battle Pass will be available from season launch to December 6th. Dominion Series The Stage 2 of the Dominion Series concluded on Saturday, Aug 28th.

It’s that time of the season again and we’re back with yet another Testing Grounds! They will be open from July 1st to July 8th. We’re doing something a bit different this time – we’re trying both Hero changes as well as system-level changes in the form of Option Select changes. The changes we’re covering in this Testing Grounds are: Raider changes Orochi changes Shinobi changes Option Select improvements Raider’s changes are mostly about making the hero more consistent as well as more efficient. We’re improving the 1v1 potential of the hero while also making sure their Zone Attacks are better. Orochi’s changes aim to improve the performance in 1v1 situations as well as in group fights, where the hero is currently struggling. Shinobi received quite large changes which should redefine how the hero plays. Shinobi should now be more focused on close-range combat and ganking, with the moveset centering around landing as many Sickle Rains as possible. Finally, we’re testing tech that should see the majority of Option Selects to be removed from the game entirely. Keep reading below for more details on the changes you can expect coming to Raider, Orochi, Shinobi, and Option Selects. You can also tune in to tomorrows Warrior’s Den where Stefan and myself will be going through all the changes. Before getting to the Testing Grounds details, we would like to address some errors in the roadmap shown in our previous Warrior’s Den. Covenant Games should be starting a week earlier, right after Testing Grounds, on July 8th and ending on July 15th. Also, the Dominion Series Stage 2 Major will begin on August 28th. This is great news for participants as they will have one extra month to prepare. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/9e1dcda2765f2baa7ccbc3f1844129c1741e4010.jpg Raider Changes Storming Tap Now 400ms, down from 500ms Now no longer interrupted on non-Superior Block No longer has variable timing as a soft feint from Heavy Attacks Now deals different damage when using Soft Feint version and Dodge version Developer’s comment: Storming Tap had a few efficiency problems, most notably it was reactable by many players, even though it had variable timing. We’ve adjusted this so that it always comes out at the same timing as Feints, sped it up so it is more reliable, and made it not interrupted when blocked so that Raider can pressure opponents better. Uninterruptible Stance Timings Adjusted Uninterruptible Stance during Heavy Attacks to always start at the feint timing instead of at various timings depending on the attack Developer’s comment: This should still let Raider use Heavy Attacks to trade with opponents, but should no longer be at timings where players could take a hit, feint then guardbreak their opponents. Zone Attacks Raider’s Storm now costs 12 stamina, down from 50 stamina Raider’s Fury now costs 12 stamina, down from 35 stamina Developer’s comment: Raider uses Zone Attacks as alternate Heavy Attacks, both in mixups and in punishes. We’ve adjusted the Stamina cost of these attacks to cost the same as Heavy Attacks so that Raider can use them more often and more efficiently. Stampede Charge Now 500ms, down from 600ms Developer’s comment: Stampede Charge was too slow to be effectively used as a ganking tool. The slightly faster speed should make it easier to players to use it to plan out ganks. Top Lights in Chains Now 500ms (down from 600ms for 2nd and 700ms for finisher) Developer’s comment: These attacks should now be in-line with other chained Light attacks. Top Heavy Finisher Now 900ms (down from 1000ms) Developer’s comment: This should help Raider catch fleeing heroes better with a soft feint to Guardbreak than before. Orochi Changes Cancel Attack Recoveries into Dodge Can now cancel all non-Dodge attack (including Storm Rush) recoveries on Hit/non-Superior Block/Miss into Dodge Developer’s comment: Orochi needed a way to be more effective in outnumbered situations as well as being able to go on the offensive more efficiently. With this change Orochi should be able to perform both well, instead of relying on the Finisher’s recovery cancels only. Light Attacks Removed Light Finisher Every non-Bash Opener now guarantees a combo Light attack that counts as the 2nd hit in chains Developer’s comment: We want to reorient Orochi into a powerful “One-Two” hero with multiple options when landing attacks so that players no longer need to rely on multiple fast light attacks and instead focus on mixups and agility. These changes should push Orochi towards this archetype. Storm Rush Now accessible from Front Dodge as well as Back Dodge All 3 sides are now 600ms total with 400ms of visible indicators (changed from 500/600/700ms) All 3 sides are now Undodgeable Now costs 12 stamina to enter and 10 to feint. No other stamina costs. Was 10 to Enter, 12 to attack, 20 to feint Developer’s comment: Storm Rush’s role...",1625162960,

Sprint Attack: Sprint Attack range increased to 2.5m (was 2) Sprint Attack forward movement increased Developer’s comment: Berserker should now be able to catch up to opponents fleeing fights more easily. Dodge Forward Heavy: Dodge Forward Heavy Long Distance attack range increased to 2.5m (was 2.25m) Forward movement during Dodge Forward Heavy Long Distance increased to 6m (was 4.75m) Added rotation speed on miss recovery to ensure it properly rotates towards the locked target on miss Fixed issues with not moving correctly but still registering a hit Fixed issues with missing but holding a direction that would weirdly snap you forward at the end Fixed issues with default movement speed at the end of the attack Fixed issues that allowed Berserker to target swap too late, causing very glitched movement Dodge Forward Light: Forward movement during Dodge Forward Light increased to 5m (was 2.25m) Set Attack Range on Dodge Forward Light to 2m (was 2.5m) Attack is now Enhanced Side Dodge Lights: Are now Enhanced Developer’s comment: Berserker should now be able to use their dodge attacks to both chase and enable their offense more reliably. Shugoki NEW CHANGES based on Testing Grounds Feedback: Heavy Finishers Heavy Finishers should now always connect when feinted to Guardbreak no matter which attack precedes it Charge of the Oni Recovery is 400ms (up from 300ms), preventing “infinite sprint” Super Sprint has feedback now Headbutt Headbutt has VFX now Demon’s Embrace Demon’s Embrace recovery is now 1300ms (down from 1500ms) After Demon’s Embrace, Shugoki can block at 1000ms CHANGES INTEGRATED from the Testing Grounds: Heavy Attacks Uncharged Heavy Finishers now have reduced rotation, allowing most heroes to be able to comfortably dodge the attacks Fixed issues related to attacks not hitting external targets since the trajectory was placed too high Adjusted feint timings on Charged Heavy Finishers to ensure it works properly (can now feint during charge, feint happens 100ms before clip ends) Headbutt Headbutt in chains is 500ms Headbutt now deals 10 damage Headbutt no longer stuns or deals stamina damage New move: Dodge Forward Headbutt Attack is 500ms Starts 300ms into front dodge New move: Dodge Side Headbutt Attack is 533ms Side Dodge now branches to Headbutt from 300 to 500ms (was from 300 to 600ms) Side Dodge Headbutt miss recovery branches to Heavy from 100ms to 600ms Developer’s comment: Shugoki’s Headbutt is now used in many more situations, and as such it needs to be more of a threat than previously. New move: Dodge Forward Heavy Added new attack: Dodge forward heavy Added Uninterruptible Stance on Dodge Forward Heavy at 400ms into the clip Developer’s comment: these new dodge attacks should provide Shugoki with enough options to properly counter opponent bashes as well as opponents who tend to roll away too much. It also gives Shugoki a neutral opener, which should help him flow better into his offense. Dodges Fixed branching speed on left/right dodges to be consistent (they are both at 300ms now) Demon's Embrace Now shows the Unblockable symbol during the initial portion of the attack No longer has variable duration and reach - it is now fully static at 900ms (the previous shortest duration) Now deals 20 damage and heals for 10 (down from 22 damage and heals for 18). This is to compensate for the attack being available from Light Parry. Now only accessible from Down + GB in neutral and after a throw (removed branching from front dodge) Now has no armor whatsoever Now recovers stamina for the opponent Adding links to Demon's Embrace from feint clips for input comfort Fixed bug on movement Developer’s comment: These changes are aimed at making Demon’s Embrace the ganking move it should be; its position in chains as a soft feint prevents it from being a thorough ganking move. Charge of the Oni Charge of the Oni is no longer an attack - it is accessed through tapping the Sprint button while sprinting, similar to Shinobi. The move no longer has dodge frames, bumps, etc. It is now a ""super sprint"" move. Shugoki cannot do Charge of the Oni if OOS Developer’s comment: Shugoki has a difficult time performing his rotations – going from the lane to a side point or from side point to side point; with this, Shugoki gains an ability similar to what Shinobi possesse...",1623361288,

After centuries of spoiling and exhausting the lands with constant battles for power and control, Mother Nature has decided to unleash her burning wrath. An intense drought has befallen the battlefield. The once rich and bountiful Heathmoor has become dry and desolate. The scorching heat toys with the minds of the most ferocious warriors, bringing forth new demons and nightmares. Who will be their salvation? This season draws inspiration from Japanese mythology and the natural disaster drought These themes are strongly portrayed in Y5S2: Mirage’s events, narrative, seasonal customization, Battle Pass, and new hero. Also, making a return this season is the Testing Grounds and hero changes based on last season’s testing grounds. For more information on everything For Honor’s Y5S2: Mirage, just keep reading. Below you will find more information on the event Visions of the Kyoshin, everything regarding Testing Grounds, and this season’s battle pass. Otherwise, you can join your fellow warriors starting June 10th in game and discover For Honor Y5S2: Mirage. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/9e1dcda2765f2baa7ccbc3f1844129c1741e4010.jpg Visions of the Kyoshin {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/8e18829caba5e0e098d2097e92009566795bb715.jpg Starting at season launch to July 1st, For Honor’s limited-time event Visions of the Kyoshin is live. Due to the battle for water, the Horkos and Chimera took the fight to the Kyoshin Temple. Groundwater was rumored to be foraged in the area. What they found there instead was torment from scorching heat and mystic warriors. Were they a mirage? Or were the Kyoshin more than a lost legend? Those who witnessed the battle agreed on one thing: The guardians of the Kyoshin Temple were nothing like anyone had ever seen... In Visions of the Kyoshin, players will experience the Dominion game mode with a twist. Powerful entities called the Heavenly Ones contest points A and C. When defeated, these give a temporary buff as well as a special vision to the player who served the final strike. For a short period of time, you will be able to peer into the realm of these entities and possibly witness what is to come... During the event, players will be able to play through a Free Event Pass and gain access to a multitude of rewards such as a new Battle Outfit, a Mood Effect as well as an Ornament. During the event there will also be new weapons available for players to loot. Battle Pass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/759d2473f95cbacbb0c024a24408fe74747fc47e.jpg The warriors of Heathmoor struggle against the drought and mind tricks. The Samurai are reminded of the Heavenly Ones, the embodiment of light and mirages in their pantheon of deities. The themes of For Honor Y5S2: Mirage make a strong impact in this season’s Battle Pass, allowing you to dress your warriors in gear reminiscent of Samurai legends and deities or bearing the cracks of a parched and desolate landscape. Players can once again play through 100 tiers of rewards and unlock a shared execution per hero, one weapon set per hero, 2 battle outfits per hero, 2 effects per hero, and other various customization elements. Participating players will also be able to unlock a paired emote only available through Y5S2’ Battle Pass. This Y5S2 Battle Pass will be available from season launch to September 7th. Y5S1 Testing Grounds Fight Team Update The Y5S1 Testing Ground changes will also be released at the start of Y5S2. Bellow you can find a list of all those heroes and more details on their changes. Berserker Gladiator Zhanhu Aramusha Shugoki Jiang Jun Hitokiri Taking the feedback we’ve received from you, our player community, we have also applied additional changes to the heroes; we’ll go into a bit of detail down below, but you can see the full list of changes in our patch notes. We look forward to seeing how they perform once they are released and we are always keeping an eye on social media and our player surveys for additional feedback. We’ll be going through each other hero give a brief overview of the changes from their Testing Grounds iterations. Berserker Berserker is the only hero who did not receive any changes from the Testing Grounds; feedback was positive and did not warrant any extra adjustments. Gladiator Most of the feedback we received from Gladiator was positive, but we received some concerns about the power level of some of his moves, notably Fuscina Ictus, Skewer and side dodge Sucker Punch. We’re also addressing the “Stamina Bully” aspect of Gladiator which is a source of frustration amongst players. Fuscina Ictus’ main issue is that it dealt too much damage, most notably against opponents who are Out of Stamina as it unbalances them and guarantees a...",1623094462,

304390,LIVE UPDATE – FOR HONOR,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/ef919929461b3cdcd356e992bd8ebfb25e8023a5.png The following changes will be part of a Live Update to For Honor on Thursday, April 29th, 2021. IMPROVEMENTS Gryphon Side Dodge Attacks (Soul Cleaver) Side Dodge Attacks are now 14 damage (down from 16) Side Dodge Attacks can no longer be delayed in side dodges; they will now always happen at 300ms (previously delayable until 500ms) Dev Comment: This should make Side Dodge Attacks more predictable, as well as making it impossible to delay to dodge on most mix-ups, while still being a good dodge attack that leads to finishers. Veteran's Kick and Slash Kick Follow-up damage has been reduced to 24 (down from 28) Gryphon's Shove Gryphon's Shove is now a Dodge Forward + Guard Break input Gryphon's Shove no longer chains after a miss Gryphon's Shove now costs 15 stamina (up from 12) Gryphon's Shove no longer pauses Stamina Regeneration Dev Comment: The previous Back + Guard Break input of 600ms was unreactable for most players outside of high-level play. This meant that Gryphon's Shove was problematic (for different reasons) in both casual and high-level play. By making Gryphon's Shove a 500ms Dodge Forward Melee, combined with the additional minimum of 300ms spent in the Forward Dodge, the move becomes predictable for most players, while also being unreactable to players at all levels of play. Gryphon's Shove should now function as a mix-up and opener that is less frustrating to face. Draconite Mist (Tier 2 Feat) Draconite Mist now heals for 15 (down from 20) AoE range of Draconite Mist's healing effect reduced to 8 meters (down from 11) Draconite Bolt (Tier 3 Feat) Draconite Bolt now heals for 15 (down from 20) AoE range of Draconite Bolt's healing effect reduced to 8 meters (down from 11) Draconite Bolt damage reduced to 20 (down from 30) Cast time of Draconite Bolt increased to 600ms (up from 400ms) ",1619461640,

The previous values no longer fell in line with the damage output from Heroes. We know that Pikemen were a source of frustration for many and with their new health values, most Heroes with a Light-Heavy combo will be able to dispatch them quicker with less stamina consumption. USER INTERFACE Improved the Dominion scoring widget: The 1000 points mark is now visible on the gauge to make the Breaking threshold easier to see at a glance A lock will appear on a team’s gauge when they reached over 1000 hard points as Breaking cannot be reverted anymore Dev Comments: While the previous scoring widget was functional, we wanted to make it easier for players to quickly grasp how close teams are to Breaking, and whether or not a rally is possible by taking a capture zone. Even if these are fairly known rules to most players, we hope it will make the widget more comfortable to use, as well as clarify how the scoring works for newer players. CUSTOMIZATION Weapon Set for Wu Lin heroes presented during the Y5S1 Warrior’s Den stream have been added as loot drops (FH-1445) BUG FIXES GENERAL Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Crosshair to never disappear from screen during matches (FH-1450) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused Revenge to stack with other damage buffs (FH-1417) FIGHTERS Lawbringer Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Lawbringer's weapon to be misplaced and appear to be hovering when performing a light attack as part of the Swift Justice Combo (FH-1048) Tiandi Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Tiandi's Dragon and Tiger dodge animations to be mixed after performing them many times (FH-1262) Shaolin Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Shaolin's Sun Kick Smash animation to stutter after changing Guard direction (FH-1066) Black Prior Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Black Prior to be missing Unblockable effect on the shield during their Hawk's Charge (FH-1458) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Black Prior to have Superior Block effect on their sword FEATS Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Shaolin's Blink feat to be allowed to block an attack as the feat is being activated (FH-1107) UNDER INTERFACE Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the selection box in Gear parts to become duplicated when scrolling through items (FH-802) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Win Loss ratio value to be different when comparing the old profile with the new one AUDIO Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused most of Year 1 DLC and Legacy heroes to not have any ""Grunts"" noise when dodging (FH-891) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused some Voice lines and grunts from attacks to be cut off early when connecting with opponent (FH-425) CUSTOMIZATION Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Gryphon’s “Rabid Wolf” elite outfit patterns and symbols to not be displayed (FH-1426) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Berserker's Asmundar helmet to have physics effect on the front metal part (FH-1382) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Zhanhu's Yushi Dafu armor chest to have physics effect on the shin parts (FH-1366) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Asgard's Favor mythic outfit Electric Storm idle effect audio to loop instead of playing normally (FH-1355) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Viking Elbow execution camera to not follow character properly (FH-1330) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Gryphon symbols and paint patterns to be misaligned with the cape (FH-1328) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Gryphon to be missing Legacy Crusader 1 and Legacy Crusader 2 color swatches (FH-1325) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Warden’s Gabrielle's Zenith set to have stretched texture on the right hand (FH-1294) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Jiang Jun's Lu Junyi Chest cape's trims and upper torso cloth to not be affected by the material or colour (FH-1149) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Gryphon's Night Bloom Elite Outfit to be missing from the Customization Menu (FH-1156) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the Female Kensei's Shigehide helm to not apply materials (FH-1045) Bug Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the female variant of the Steinunn to not apply the color on the chest piece (FH-1074) ",1619134669,

We’ll be opening it up from April 1st to April 8th. This time around we’re testing changes to seven heroes. They are: Shugoki Aramusha Berserker Jiang Jun Hitokiri Zhanhu Gladiator Shugoki’s changes revolve around making him less frustrating to play against, while giving him ganking tools and better 1v1 pressure. For Aramusha, we’re looking to improve the viability of Blade Blockade, as well as giving the hero an opener and ways to deal with bashes. Berserker gets mostly quality of life changes; Dodge Attacks in general are made more effective. Jiang Jun has changes to his Stamina consumption as well as his Guardbreak punishes and his Heavy Finishers to make him stronger in 1v1. Hitokiri has changes to improve flowing into chains and ways to deal with bashes. Zhanhu’s changes revolve around having better neutral pressure, getting more chances to Dodge Cancel recoveries as well as improving the Side Dodge attacks. Finally, Gladiator gains improved chaining ability and improvements to his Dodge Attacks. We’ll be going through an overview of the changes per hero. For a more in-depth view of these changes, we’re encouraging you once again to watch the Warrior’s Den. Shugoki Demon’s Embrace Now performed from neutral with a Back + Guardbreak input Total attack duration reduced to 900ms Now heals for 20 damage and deals 10 damage Now fully restores Stamina to Shugoki’s opponent No longer has Armor Developer’s comment: These changes are aimed at making Demon’s Embrace the ganking move it should be; its position in chains as a soft feint prevents it from being a thorough ganking move. Charge of the Oni Now accessible from hitting the Sprint button while Sprinting only While Charge of the Oni is active, Shugoki gains increased movement speed and his stamina is slowly depleted. Removed Armored and Unblockable properties from the move Developer’s comment: Shugoki has a difficult time performing his rotations – going from the lane to a side point or from side point to side point; with this, Shugoki gains an ability similar to what Shinobi possesses and is able to move around the battlefield more swiftly. Dodge Attacks New Option: Side Dodge Headbutt New Option: Front Dodge Headbutt New Option: Forward Dodge Heavy Developer’s comment: These new dodge attacks should provide Shugoki with enough options to properly counter opponent bashes as well as opponents who tend to roll away too much. It also gives Shugoki a neutral opener, which should help him flow better into his offense. Headbutt Now deals 10 damage No longer stuns, deals Stamina damage and pause stamina regeneration 500ms from Front Dodge and in chains, 533ms on Side Dodges Developer’s comment: Shugoki’s Headbutt is now used in many more situations, and as such it needs to be more of a threat than previously. Light Attacks No longer Armored Developer’s comment: This helps prevent frustration while fighting against Shugoki, who could hit Light on reaction to anything his opponents threw. Aramusha Blade Blockade and followups Can now cancel the recovery of any attack to Blade Blockade on Hit, Miss and non-interrupted Block All Blade Blockade followups are now guaranteed Heavy Followup is now a side Unblockable attack with Zone Attack properties Light Followup is now a top Unblockable attack Push Back Kick Followup is unchanged Removed Ring the Bell from Blade Blockade followups Developer’s comment: These changes should improve Blade Blockade to where you use the appropriate followup depending on the situation and make Blade Blockade much easier to access. Dodge Attacks Rushing Wind attack can no longer select which side to attack (always top) o Armor now starts at 400ms (up from 100ms) New Option: Side Dodge Heavy o 600ms attack o Initiates chains Developer’s comment: Aramusha should now be able to deal with opponent bashes and initiate his offense better. Ring the Bell Soft Feints Heavy Openers now soft feint to Ring the Bell Dodge Forward Heavy now soft feints to Ring the Bell Developer’s comment: Aramusha now gains a tool to both open up opponents as well as set up ganks. Attack Chains Aramusha now chains to Finishers when a second attack is performed without switching stances. Developer’s comment: This removes the need for Aramusha to do Side -> Top -> Side to continue his infinite chain. This should alleviate some of the predictability and give new options in group fights. Berserker Top Light Opener Now 500ms (down from 600ms) and deals 12 damage (down from 13) After Feint version is now 400ms (down from 500ms) and deals 11 damage (down from 12) Developer’s comment: These changes normalize all of Berserker’s neutral light attacks, giving them all the same utility. Dodge Attacks Head Slider attack is now Enhanced and moves forward further Spin Chop attacks are now Enhanced Head Crusher now moves forward further Developer’s comment: ...",1617317278,
304390,FOR HONOR – YEAR 5 SEASON 1 ASUNDER OUT NOW,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/37afe0353c447abe6857905eb54c8ace96d30692.png For Honor: Asunder For Honor’s 5th year is finally here with Y5S1: Asunder! All celebrate their chosen covenants and continue their march to battle. Starting March 11th, experience how Heathmoor is now torn asunder between the Order of Horkos and the Chimera Alliance. Get access to new armor variations, weapons, events, battle pass and more! For more insight into Y5S1, you can hear what the dev team has to say by checking our Y5S1 Season Reveal Livestream on Warrior’s Den. The Story Thus Far… After the Battle of the Eclipse, the Chimera Alliance and Order of Horkos fought relentlessly for years. As Heathmoor's population declined, people everywhere began to make 'Covenants', secret pacts to share intel and resources, with either Horkos or Chimera warriors. Covenants could be used to gain allies outside their faction, while rooting out the evil among their own. Sealing a Covenant was also a symbolic way to make a statement about the future. Would someone embrace the warmongering views of the Horkos, following strict codes and rituals to keep the strongest in their rightful place? Or would they rather fight for Chimera's ideals of solidarity and peace? Horkos Masquerade {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/3d0b7272d1aabc672caf52a0d3e8b750dbf7644e.jpg Those determined to honor Apollyon's legacy, and to create a new order ruled by the most deserving warriors of Heathmoor, often pledged their alliance to Horkos. Among the various initiation rites that would allow someone to join the Order, the Masquerade would pit a promising challenger against other warriors in a deadly battle. Only the survivors would be accepted in the Order. It was a way to keep the strongest in their rightful place, while bringing new recruits in the Horkos. From season launch to April 1st, you are invited to the Horkos Masquerade. Will you be strong enough to survive and stay? Participate in a special Horkos themed game mode, Carousel of Horkos, and earn exclusive Weapons. Carousel of Horkos is a 4v4 PVP game mode. Two teams compete until all the members of the same team are defeated at the same time. It's a Single Pick match with no Revive, no Feats and no Gear Perks. To add to the chaos, there is a buffed up Neutral Bot known as “The Horkos Challenger”, that will attempt to defeat you. Quick tip, if you succeed in killing the NPC, you steal its modifier. During the event, all warriors will have access to the free Event Pass which allows them to earn a multitude of rewards such as a new Battle Outfit, a Mood Effect, as well as an Ornament. You can also expect 28 new event specific weapons to loot from now until April. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/0d2fa6c8a4fde3a9d399efd1bb098796a3b80cce.png In Y5S1 Paired Emotes are coming to For Honor! Celebrate gruesome executions, epic ledges, savage ganks, or simply express yourself along with your warrior friends. For Honor's first Paired Emote, Chest Bump, will be available through Y5S1's Battle Pass. Warden Updated {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/67f43c7b77373a3cee7c40011a3cf48147e61c64.jpg Based on your feedback from our previous Testing Grounds, updates to Warden's gameplay take effect at season start. For more information regarding Warden’s Changes, and future testing grounds, check out our Fight Update article. New Seasonal Customization {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/1c5ae09fea84f1c4b4fdb0a2d47115feec993864.png While some makers chose to serve the Horkos, others followed Ilma's lead and joined the Chimera. These skilled artisans benefitted from the newest technological advances and shared resources to improve the warriors' gear. In Y5S1, For Honor continues to bring new seasonal customization. Throughout the season, look out for new armor variations, weapons, and more! Battle Pass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/6709c93447298251fb23306fe88518c1e5c2cc78.jpg With more resources at their disposal, the makers of Horkos were able to craft some of the most refined weapons and draperies one could find in Heathmoor. A scribe who attended one of the Masquerades described the style of the Horkos warriors as 'sophisticated yet violent, gorgeous yet terrifying'. If one took a closer look at the bright colors and smiling masks of Horkos, they would discern a disturbing truth beneath the lavish surface. This season, play through the Battle Pass, and add some Horkos flair to your character's look through the 100 Tiers of rewards available for all heroes! Remember, exclusively included in this season’s Battle Pass is For Honor’s first ever paired emote Chest Bump.

We are working on a fix and will release it as soon as possible. Known Issue: Warden's zone attack is undodgeable, but lacks the blue undodgeable effect, We are working on a fix and will release it as soon as possible BATTLE PASS FEST Battle Fest is a weekend when players will grind double BP points compare as normal day (same as XP fest but for BP points) FACTION WAR Starting in Y5S1, changes are coming to the rewards warriors will receive at the conclusion of seasonal faction wars. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/0780ef0a8c9677514c32197c1d296ec1d727ddab.jpg We made the faction-colored territories on the World Map more transparent to make the seasonal and event realization elements more visible. IMPROVEMENTS FIGHTERS General Whenever a Hero is in the startup of a Guard Break, if that Hero is struck by a Guard Break it will now automatically perform a Guard Break Counter. Developer's comment: This is to prevent situations where two players would attempt to Guard Break each other at a very specific timing and the first player to get Guard Broken would need to re-press the Guard Break button to tech it. Warden The changes from the Y4|S4 Testing Grounds are now live, with bug fixes and other improvements. Shoulder Bash Shoulder Bash is no longer accessible from Back Dodge Shoulder Bash now slightly moves forward when feinted Fully Charged Shoulder Bash no longer has additional forward movement when feinted Any Non-Shoulder Bash Attack can now chain to Shoulder Bash. Developer’s comment: These changes should help Shoulder Bash both feel fairer and flow better. Warden now has to be on the offensive to use Shoulder Bash and rewards using every part of the kit instead of relying on only part of the kit. Heavy Attacks Side Heavy Openers now have flatter and larger trajectories Top Heavy Finisher is now a 900ms attack (down from 1000ms) Side Heavy Finishers are now 900ms attacks (up from 800ms) Side Heavy Finishers are now Unblockable Side Heavy Finishers now deal 30 damage (down from 35 during the Testing Grounds) Top Heavy Finisher now deals 32 damage (down from 34 in the Testing Grounds) Side Heavy Finisher trajectories are now flatter Warden now moves forward more when performing Side Heavy Finishers Light Attacks now chain to Heavy Finishers at 100ms during their recoveries (down from 200ms) Developer’s comment: Warden should now be able to use Heavy attacks more effectively; the increased speed on the Top Heavy Finisher makes it harder to interrupt and Side Heavy Attacks (both Openers and Finishers) are stronger both in group fights as well as the minion lane. Zone Attack Zone Attack recovery is now 500ms (down from 1000ms) Warden now moves forward more when performing Zone Attack Developer’s comment: Warden’s Zone Attack no longer needs to commit to an additional attack to be useful; the extra forward movement also helps in group fights to catch opponents that might be further away. Additional fixes based on Y4|S4’s Testing Grounds player feedback: Fixed an issue where Side Heavy Finishers were undodgeable after a Top Heavy Opener (FH-1089) Fixed an issue where Side Heavy Finishers were undodgeable after a Top Heavy Opener (FH-1022) FEATS Replaced “Thick Blood” on Warden and Nuxia with “Thrilling Comeback” Thrilling Comeback is a passive Feat that recovers a small amount of health upon entering Revenge Developer’s comment: Player feedback from the Y4|S4 Testing Grounds correctly noted that Thick Blood Warden negatively affected the viability of Testing Grounds Peacekeeper and Nobushi – as it nullifies their bleed entirely. Here, by changing the effect of Thick Blood entirely, we remove the unhealthy aspect of being able to shut down bleed heroes’ kits for free, as well as the bad feeling of taking Thick Blood but not queuing into any bleed heroes. In this new Thrilling Comeback, it retains the passive feature of making you live a bit longer, and now is globally useful with a much more healthy design. MAP Forge Created new stair access points to Capture Zone A Created an access point from Mid-lane into the central workshop building Reworked Ashfeld lighting environment and is now daylight BREACH Added a warning to the defending team when their Commander takes damage USER INTERFACE We tweaked the size and opacity of revive/executed icons to make them less intrusive BUG FIXES GENERAL Fixed an issue that allowed the Special follow-ups after Superior Blocking/Deflecting attacks to trigger on ally or minion hits Fixed an issue that caused the Centurion or Jormungandr to perform “Eagle's Talons” or “Hamarr Slam” on an opponent that will not be Unbalanced (FH-1136) Fixed an issue that caused the dodge shadows VFX to remain stuck on players FIGHTERS Lawbringer Fixed an issue that caused Lawbringe...",1615495595,
304390,FOR HONOR - TERMINOLOGY GUIDE,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/b10fc5118954410d78ed138189c41f1c4a97ba35.jpg Welcome new and returning Warriors! The For Honor community uses a lot of complex terminology when discussing this game. This can be frustrating to newer or more relaxed players who are just trying to understand their own hero. We created this guide for players who don’t understand their losses, or feel that they may be missing crucial knowledge. Practice always helps, but game knowledge can go a long way when asking “How do I stop light spammers?” or “how do I deal with bashes?” Whether you’re new or just someone who wants to brush up on their terminology, we hope you find this useful. For Honor Terms and Concepts: Bashes Bashes are moves that cannot be blocked or parried. They are often used to open up opponents. Bashes typically use part of the body or armor rather than a weapon. Warden’s Shoulder Bash is a well-known example of this type of move. Counter-play: Dodging is the main defense against bashes. Heroes that have a dodge attack can deal with bashes quite well. Another counter is reading when a player is likely to use a bash – catch them early enough, and you can use an attack to interrupt the bash before it even gets started. Uninterruptible Stance / Hyper Armor https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/forhonor/fh-game/terminology-hyper_364432.gif Uninterruptible Stance (often called hyper armor) is an attack that, at some point in the animation, cannot be stopped. Landing an attack on a hero who is attacking with an Uninterruptible move will not interrupt the animation, and heroes like Hitokiri and Shugoki are able to strategically trade damage for damage. Counter-play: Attacks with uninterruptible stance can still be defended against with parries and dodges, though sometimes these attacks have other special properties (such as the Unblockable property). They also may have variable timing, which can throw off your dodge and parry attempts. Be aware that deflects are not always a good option against Uninterruptible attacks. Typically, heroes with deflects have less health, so the damage trade-off may not be worth it. Enhanced Attacks Enhanced attacks are attacks that can be used in a combo after a prior attack has been blocked. Most attacks can’t go further into a combo after a block, as it puts the blocked hero into recovery. Warlord is a hero whose light attacks are enhanced. Counter-play: Enhanced attacks should be kept in mind so you’re not caught unawares after a successful block. Unblockable Attacks Unblockable attacks are marked by a red trail on the weapon, in addition to a specific symbol that will appear. As you may suspect, Unblockable attacks cannot be blocked. Dodging and parrying are still options. Counter-play: Unblockable attacks force you to take some sort of action. Either dodge, parry, or interrupt the attack before it even begins. Use the Training Mode to practice defending against specific moves using pre-set AI attacks. Undodgeable Attacks Undodgeable attacks are marked by a blue trail. Counter-play: Undodgeable attacks are an effective way of catching dodge attack-focused heroes. If you’re playing Tiandi or Zhanhu, be more careful in your use of that part of your moveset. Feints There are two types of feint: hard feints and soft feints. Hard feints are used to cancel heavy attacks. “Soft” feints are moves that don’t require the use of the “Feint” input to be changed. Kensei, for example, has a few different soft feints from their top heavy finisher. By pressing the light attack button and a direction, they can adjust to a side light attack. Punishes Punishes are the optimal attack to use in certain situations. It’s important to note that every hero has different punishes, but as a general rule you can use more damaging attacks if you manage to parry a light attack. Heavy attacks may only be punished by a light or a Zone. Some heroes have dedicated punishes. If Nuxia parries an attack, she can use her dedicated parry punish move. If she parries a light attack, she can use her heavy attack to punish her opponent for more damage. But she technically does have a dedicated parry punish that she can choose to use. Game Score Game Score is how you push the enemy team into “Breaking.” When a team reaches 1000 points, their opponent is pushed into Breaking. When a team is breaking, it can’t respawn. One crucial part of Game Score is the distinction between hard points and soft points. Some actions give your team points that never go away (i.e. killing heroes and minions). But when you capture a Zone, your team receives 100 soft points, which contribute to your team’s Game Score until the other team capture the Zone back. This is important to know when in Breaking, because it means that capturing an enemy-controlled Zone may both release your team from Breaking, and possibly put the other team into Breaking.

304390,YEAR 5 SEASON 1: FIGHT TEAM UPDATE,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/45707de2f63d742a39b9eeffa5839a642237f2b7.jpg Hello Warriors! JC here again from the Fight Team, with an update to our plans for Year 5! First, we’ll be releasing the Warden improvements we tested in Year 4 Season 4’s Testing Grounds. Feedback was positive, and we made minor improvements and bug fixes, but generally Warden is unchanged, kit-wise, from the previous Testing Grounds. For a full list of changes to the Warden, please refer to our patch notes coming on Thursday, March 11th. We also have exciting news to share about Testing Grounds in Year 5! Warden Improvements Based on your feedback, we felt Warden was almost ready for release. We took extra time to look over the feedback we received, as well as parsed through our data, and ultimately felt that Warden could release almost as-is from the version that was present in the Testing Grounds. Aside from bug fixes, the one change that stuck out the most was damage on Warden’s Side Heavy Finishers being too high, especially compared to the damage dealt by the Top Heavy Finisher, and so we adjusted it downwards to be more in-line with other attacks. In addition to this, we’re also changing Thick Blood, which is present on Warden and Nuxia – it is a frequent subject of feedback from players as it invalidates the kit of certain heroes almost completely. To address this, Thick Blood no longer makes the hero immune to Bleed and Fire Damage, but instead heals the hero when they activate Revenge. This ensures that the feat is no longer a hard counter to certain heroes while keeping some utility in group fights. Year 5 Testing Grounds We are proud to announce that we aim to have the Testing Grounds open more frequently in Year 5 to test upcoming balance changes! We are looking to bring up heroes that might be lower in viability – similarly to what we did in Year 4 Season 4 with Nobushi and Peacekeeper, the global aim is to improve on heroes considered weak to make them more in-line with the rest of the cast. We would love to see more diversity in hero picks, and this is a big step towards this goal. Additionally, the feedback we received for Shugoki during the last Testing Grounds indicated players had issues with Demons’ Embrace and as such we’re giving it another go with a new round of changes, going in a similar direction as the last ones but with changes addressing feedback we received from you, our players. In the next Testing Grounds, you will be able to test not only new Shugoki changes but also multiple other heroes we’re looking to improve. Stay tuned for more details!",1615231333,

Some years have passed after the events of the Battle of the Eclipse and the battle still rages on between the Order of Horkos and the Chimera Alliance. Both covenants are at a stalemate with no signs of either side gaining the upper hand anytime soon. With their forces diminishing, there is an abundance of resources. Both sides use this to their advantage and throw celebrations to attract new recruits and further spread their influence, and ideals, among the warriors of the land. In the Year of the Covenants, we dive deeper into Horkos and Chimera’s values and ideals. We will see how they deal with hardship and disaster while war rages on between them. Their story will continue to unfold over the course of 4 new seasons each with new themes, a Battle Pass, and exciting events. Year 5 will also see 2 new heroes entering the roster with their own rich backgrounds and fighting styles. As the year unfolds, be sure to keep an eye out from us for official news on what is to come. Shovel Knight Warriors: we’d like to introduce you to a new, special kind of Knight.

Outfits Paint Patterns, Symbols and Embossings Ornaments, Materials and Color Palettes Armor and Weapon looks Executions, Emotes, Signatures and Effects Developer's comment: We really want players to be able to explore the fashion of their characters in For Honor, and we know that the number of items players can own can quickly be overwhelming. The bookmarking feature will allow you to sort out your favorite customization elements to easily find them back later down the road, or help you thematize your loadouts for instance! IMPROVEMENTS GUARDBREAK While locked onto an opponent, guard break attempts with a minion or pikeman in the way will now bump them out of the way, greatly reducing the odds of accidentally guard breaking them (FH-89) FIGHTERS Peacekeeper Zone Attack Is now Enhanced Now counts as a Heavy Attack when parried 1st hit now causes a Medium hit reaction (up from Light) 2nd hit now feints 100ms before Parry window 2nd hit can now soft feint to Dodge at feint timing 2nd hit can now soft feint to Guard Break at feint timing 2nd hit is now Unblockable if Peacekeeper is locked on to an opponent suffering from Bleed Zone Attack 2nd hit recovery is now 700ms (down from 1000ms) Developers comment: These changes ensure Peacekeeper’s Zone Attack remains an effective tool. In addition to the Testing Grounds changes, we have also adjusted the first hit granting a Medium hit reaction ensuring that Peacekeeper is safe when feinting the 2nd hit as well as lowering the recovery to ensure she is frame advantaged when landing the 2nd hit. Dagger Cancel Dagger Cancel now has 400ms of hit recovery (down from 700ms) Dagger Cancel can now cancel its recovery with a Dodge at 333ms Developers comment: This enables Peacekeeper to be frame advantaged after landing a Dagger Cancel and lets her continue her offense when it lands, while letting her also cancel the recovery with a dodge to ensure it can be used more safely in group fights. Heavy Attacks Each Heavy Attack now deals 2 more damage than before This includes Dodge Attacks Heavy Finishers gain Unblockable if Peacekeeper is locked on to an opponent suffering from Bleed Developers comment: The change to damage ensures that Peacekeeper is still slightly above the curve in damage without being overboard like it was in the Testing Grounds. The change to Heavy Finishers also gives her extra synergy with her Bleeds, which lets her loop back into Bleed if one of its options successfully lands. Deflect Deflect is now performed with the Heavy attack button instead of the Light attack button Developers comment: Many heroes share inputs with their Deflect follow-ups as well as their Dodge Attacks – this change was made to ensure that Peacekeeper can always perform the appropriate follow-up. Nobushi Heavy Finishers and Heavy attacks from Hidden Stance are now Undodgeable Developer's Comment: These changes ensure that Nobushi has a mix-up with her Undodgeable Heavies and Kick, letting her apply pressure to opponents in 1v1 scenarios. Advancing Thrust now chains to Heavy Finishers Developer's Comment: Nobushi should now be able to pressure with her mix-up from Advancing Thrust since it can now also chain to Heavy Finishers. Zone Attack 2nd hit can now be soft feinted into Kick, Heavy Finishers and Dodge Stamina costs have been adjusted to 20 for 1st strike, 20 for 2nd strike and 10 for feint (was 40 for 1st strike, 20 for 2nd strike, 0 for feint) Developer's Comment: Nobushi’s Zone Attack can now be used to initiate pressure with mix-ups in its second part, and the lowered stamina cost should help when using her in the lane where she can clear minions efficiently. Sidewinder Now branches to Heavy Finishers Chains to Kick and Retreating Viper at 400ms (down from 500ms) Cancels its recoveries into Dodge and Hidden stance at 400ms (down from 500ms) Developer's Comment: Much like Advancing Thrust, Sidewinder now enables her Kick/undodgeable mix-up, and the improved chaining speeds shou...",1611888270,

The one who is now known as 'Gryphon' has traveled far and wide, learned fighting techniques from warriors across all of Heathmoor and added his own deadly twist to them. Wielding the bardiche, this charismatic leader excels in all situations and keeps his allies alive to fight another day. Difficulty: Easy Support/Healer Good Melee Range Special Capabilities Strong Mix-Up in the Chain Finishers Many Maneuvers and Attacks shortcut to the Chain Finisher Mix-Up Many Team-Healing Support Feats REVENGE We have further improved the Revenge User Interface to display more information: The Revenge gauge around enemies’ emblems will now blink if your next attack will increase their Revenge We have removed the old Revenge Gauge in the bottom left screen as the information there was a duplicate of the gauge around players’ emblems Developer’s comment: The original intention behind the recent Revenge changes was to allow players to make better decisions during group fights. Showing the Revenge gauge was a first step, and we’re now displaying more granular information by indicating whether or not an attack will feed revenge to ensure players can adjust their course of actions accordingly. We have replaced the “Revenge Attack” Feat with “Executioner’s Respite”. “Executioner’s Respite” increases heals of executions by 50% of their base value Developer’s comment: Now that the Revenge status is visible by everyone, having a Feat that lets the owner alter their Revenge state by themselves made it look inconsistent and confusing. and it defeated the purpose of giving better information on players’ status. We've replaced the feat with a whole new effect for any Hero that uses it, which we hope will be useful to all of them. We have updated the “Righteous Deflection” Feat to ensure it no longer affects Revenge gains but the other effects of the Feat remain unchanged Developer’s comment: For the same reason we have changed the “Revenge Attack” Feat, we made sure players cannot affect their Revenge status by themselves anymore with “Righteous Deflection”. NEXT GEN SUPPORT Additionally to the graphical improvements that were available since the launch of the PS5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Serie S, we are happy to introduce a 60 Frame Rate per Second on those consoles, so to recap: Available since the consoles launch 4k Resolution on PS5 and Xbox Series X, 1080p on Xbox Series S Increased Level of Detail Increased Shadow Resolution Screen Space Reflection Available with 2.24.0 All the above 60 FPS on PS5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S 2-STEPS VERIFICATION REWARDS Activate the 2-Steps Verification to receive 7 Days of Champion Status and “Horns of Eminence” Ornament! If you already activated the 2-Steps Verification in the past, your reward will automatically be delivered on your next login. Please note this reward can only be redeemed once. Known Issue: The Ornament will not be highlighted as a “New” Item in your inventory For any issues with the 2-Steps Verification: Please consult this FAQ or contact Customer Support. IMPROVEMENTS FEATS Decreased Bounty Hunter heals to 20 (from 30). Developer's comment: Bounty Hunter is already considered a 1st pick for all Heroes that carry it for its very high payoff, passive status with no cooldown and easy conditions to fulfill. Coupled with the Devourer Perk and now Executioner's Respite, we decided to lower its healing values to something we feel is more in line with the power level of a Tier 1 Feat. MAP Beachhead Removed spikes from Capture Zone A Attackers now have a secondary entrance in to Capture Zone C via a new sloped path, that veers right and leads through a broken wall that then connects to the zone Added a new bridge connection between Capture Zone C and the ramparts on the opposite side, which were previously not part of the playing area. The bridge overlooks the Mid Lane Attackers can now access the left-hand side of the ramparts via a ladder Added stairs that connect Mid Lane to Capture Zone C, removing the one way drops onto Mid Lane throughout the area Reworked Ashfeld lighting environment to make it brighter Beachhead Duel Moved one of the duel arenas from the Ramparts (Capture Zone C) to the Defender Stronghold Beachhead Brawl Removed props and fires and centered Player spawn points at Mid Lane Developer's comment: Beachhead was in much need for some drastic changes for some time. Attackers had too few options when it came to navigating towards both Capture Zone areas. The newly added slopes, stairs and ladders will now allow Attackers (as well as Defenders) to easily get to wherever they need to go. Another issue in the map was that Mid-Lane was subjected to too many drop attack opportunities throughout its entire length due to the one-way drop...",1607721678,

304390,For Honor Year 4 Season 4 Mayhem is Here!,"For Honor® Year 4 Season 4 Mayhem is now available for all players! In a pivotal moment in Heathmoor’s history, rebels from all factions needed guidance to become a full-blown army, and the mercenary Gryphon answered their call to form the Chimera Alliance. Beginning today, the Knight Errant Gryphon invites players to join the resistance to defy the Order of Horkos and stop the Corruption in Year 4 Season 4 Mayhem. Players can now unlock Gryphon as a playable Hero. Previously known as Holden Cross, Gryphon was a great warrior in the Order of the Lawbringers who fought side-by-side with Apollyon. After her death, he was rejected by his fellow Lawbringers, prompting him to join a mercenary guild and journey across the world, making friendships in all factions and learning new fighting techniques with a Bardiche, a sturdy poleaxe. Starting today, players can purchase Gryphon for $7.99 as part of a package that includes the new Hero, one exclusive Ornament, one Elite Outfit, three crates, and seven days of Champion Status. Players can also unlock the Gryphon Hero for 15,000 Steel in-game beginning December 24. Starting today, players can also purchase the Year 4 Season 4 Battle Pass to gain access to 100 tiers of premium rewards including weapons, outfits, mood effect, and more. Players who want a head start unlocking this content can purchase the Year 4 Season 4 Battle Bundle, which instantly unlocks the first 25 tiers. From today until December 17, For Honor’s Testing Grounds are once again opening for a new testing phase. All players will be able to try new gameplay improvements for Warden, Peacekeeper, Shugoki, and Nobushi. In addition, Year 4 Season 4 Mayhem will also conclude the For Honor Dominion Series, the currently on-going competitive program Ubisoft announced in the beginning of Year 4. Players will have one more chance to compete in the Last Chance Qualifier Pools and Playoffs on Dec 19 and Jan 9 respectively to earn their spot in the Grand Finals, which will happen on Jan 23.

304390,TESTING GROUNDS: HERO IMPROVEMENTS OVERVIEW,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/4a5b4811a10f446688fdcc543ab653c725115465.png Hello Warriors! Once again, we’re opening the Testing Grounds from December 10th to December 17th so that you can all try out new hero improvements! Right here, we’ll be focusing on an overview of the changes and what we’re trying to fix with some of your favorite heroes. If you’re interested in a more in-depth exploration of the changes, we’re encouraging you to watch the Warrior’s Den segment where we go in depth on every change and discuss how it affects that hero’s gameplay. This Testing Grounds features improvement to four heroes: Warden Peacekeeper Shugoki Nobushi For Warden, we’re focusing on changes regarding fully charged Shoulder Bash feints and Back Dodge Shoulder Bash, as well as, making the hero more viable in 1v1 and 1vX situations. Peacekeeper’s changes revolve around giving her more mobility in group fights as well as adding a new synergy point for her Bleeds. We’re also improving her base damage to help her defeat her opponents more swiftly. Shugoki received changes aimed at some of his Armored moves. We’re also adding two new moves in his arsenal, giving him a way to catch up to rolling opponents as well to deal with bashes. Finally, with Nobushi, we’re looking to improve her flow so that she is effective in 1v1 as well as in the minion lane. Warden Shoulder Bash is no longer accessible via Back Dodging. Fully Charged Shoulder Bash no longer has extra movement when feinted. Dev Comment: With these changes, Shoulder Bash should feel less effective defensively. Each of Warden’s Attacks (except Shoulder Bash) can now chain to Shoulder Bash. Dev Comment: Warden now has easier access to Shoulder Bash and is no longer limited to using Lights to go on the offensive. These changes along with the changes stated above shifts Warden’s 1v1 playstyle from defensive to more offensive. Side Heavy Opener trajectories have been improved. All Heavy Finishers are now 900ms and Unblockable. Side Heavy Finisher trajectories have been improved. Zone Attack recovery is now 500ms (from 1000ms). Dev Comment: These are changes aimed at making Warden more effective in outnumbered scenarios. Peacekeeper All Heavy Attacks (including dodge attacks) now deal 5 extra baseline damage. Bleed damage has not changed. When locked on to a Bleeding opponent, Heavy Finishers and the 2nd hit of Zone Attack are now Unblockable. Dev Comment: Peacekeeper should now have stronger 1v1 pressure as well as be able to execute more often. Dagger Cancel can now cancel its recovery with Dodge. Dev Comment: Dagger Cancel should now be more useful in outnumbered situations. Zone Attack is now Enhanced and gives a Heavy Parry reaction when Parried. Zone Attack 2nd hit now soft feints to Guardbreak and Dodge. Dev Comment: Zone Attack has been normalized and with the Unblockable changes now functions as an easy to access mixup from neutral. Deflect is now performed with Heavy Attack instead of Light Attack Dev Comment: This should make it easier to land deflects and removes the necessity to always press Light after a Dodge in case a Deflect was performed. Shugoki Light Openers no longer have Armor. Demon’s Embrace no longer has Armor. Dev Comment: Removal of Armor on these two moves should make them less oppressive. NEW OPTION: Dodge Forward Heavy. Dev Comment: Shugoki can now catch back rollers effectively. NEW OPTION: Side Dodge Melee. Dev Comment: Shugoki now has a tool to deal with Melee attacks. Nobushi Hidden Stance now costs 12 stamina (Down from 24). Heavy Finishers and Heavy Attacks from Hidden Stance are now Undodgeable. Zone Attack 2nd hit now soft feints into Kick, Heavy Finisher and Dodge. Zone Attack 1st hit now costs 20 stamina (Down from 40). Cobra Strike now chains to Heavy Finisher. Sidewinder now chains to Heavy Finisher. Dev Comment: Nobushi’s flow has been improved – Heavy Finishers being Undodgeable gives her a mixup with her Kicks, Zone Attack now also has a built-in mixup and her dodge attacks now give her stronger presence in the minion lane. We hope you enjoy trying out these changes to Warden, Peacekeer, Shugoki, and Nobushi. We’ll be sending out a survey soon and we’ll be monitoring social media for feedback, so do not hesitate to voice your opinion on the changes. See you on the battlefield!",1607024287,

304390,TEAM IDENTIFICATION UPDATE,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/2525663bf2f25be63e92991c96549a24b52cf7ba.jpg Hello Warriors, Today we’ll be going in depth on a long-awaited improvement: an update to our Team Identification system. Overall, the goal of this update is to improve team-related user interface and grant character customization without any color restriction! Before the team Identification update Since For Honor has launched, you can either be on the Defender (blue) or the Attacker team (orange). While developing the game, we saw in many tests that players tended to quickly tell allies and enemies apart based on the colors they were wearing. Without color restrictions, confusing situations occurred in close quarter fights, with players wearing colors of the opposite teams on their armor (Defenders wearing orange; Attackers wearing blue) To avoid these issues, we decided to categorize the color palettes. This way, players would only be able to wear colors that would match their current role (Defender or Attacker) on their armor in team-based game modes. Of course, this choice came with drawbacks – as a player you were constrained to color palettes respecting blue and orange tones depending on which team you were on. With this update, that is no longer the case. The changes made will shift team identification to a function of user interface elements, allowing for an unrestricted use of colors in customization. Here are the details of what we will develop in this post: The removal of the color palette categorization The new team color paradigm The changes in the user interface What will change on patch release date The update in details Color palettes’ categorization removed The priority of this update was to remove the Attacker/Neutral/Defender color palettes separation and allow for more customization options in the future. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/d2881a732ef526178f5ad144d173fa1d4f243582.png As you can see, you now only have one tab for your customization freeing you to use any colors no matter the team you are on (attacking or defending). All existing palettes are now in this one tab. You can also expect more varied materials as seasons progress and content is added given that the update removes color constraints. Consequently, with this update, we’ve made some significant changes to the way we feedback allies and enemies visually through the User Interface to ensure proper team identification remains intact. Changing the team color paradigm The first and most visible change: You’ll always be in team blue from now on. No more switching from blue to orange team regardless if you are attacking or defending! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/655d205d766d062de4fa4915fe6f29980d571c20.jpg This change was intended to simplify the players’ visual cues: Blue elements are always your team’s; orange elements are always the enemies’. This makes Team Identification easier and more consistent across the board. This change also laid the ground for the second part of our update: Highlighting your allies We’ve taken several steps to increase the differences between allies and enemies by focusing more visual information on your allies as opposed to your enemies. Doing so shifts the paradigm of visual identification: While it used to rely mostly on team color before, the amount of information you get on a player is now an additional tool to help with identification. These changes also give more information to help you better coordinate with your teammates during a game. Allies outlines We’ve added a blue outline to all your teammates. This helps mitigate “cross-color” customization and acts a strong differentiation element: No outline = enemies. This change also lets you see your allies from any point on the map. This allows you to better know what situation you and your teammates are in and adapt more efficiently. This outline can be disabled in the option menu, for players who feel comfortable relying on other elements for Team Identification. Modifying Allies’ and Enemies’ UI Allies’ name will now be displayed all the time, which should also help you spot groupmates. You will see enemies’ emblem the same way as before, but their detailed information (name, health, stamina) will now only be displayed when engaged in fight with them. We’ve also colored health bars to emphasize teams: Allies’ health bars are now colored in blue, enemies’ are now orange. Adapting current feedback to the new system As all these changes are pretty significant, we had to adapt several elements of the game to be compliant with the new system: Offerings, War Banners, and reveal feedback As we’re now using outlines to highlight allies, we had to update the way we feedback several elements in the game. Players revealed by Feats (such as Scout) or by the Oracle Offering in Tribute will have both an outline and a fill based on their team color. Players bearing Offerings in Tribute or the War Banner in Breach will now be shown as a pulsing fill based on their team color. Custom mat...",1600392417,
304390,PATCH NOTES 2.22.0,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/f772323730cc6ea64dc618423960bceb8660bdcb.png PATCH NOTES 2.22.0 – FOR HONOR You may notice that we skipped 2.21.0. This is due to technical difficulties that we encountered in preparation of this season’s release. This in no way impacts the content, features and bug fixes planned for the release of Year 4 Season 3. Patch Size: PS4: 1.75Gb Xbox One: 2.05Gb PC: 2.05Gb NEW MAP: THE BELVEDERE After entering a Wu Lin pavilion, one may discover a Belvedere with a scenic view. Time to duel in this brand-new map! This new map is available in Duel, Brawl and Ranked Due TEAM IDENTIFICATION Developer’s Comment: Time to bring your hero's customization to the next level! No more distinctions between Attacker, Defender or Neutral colors: you can now wear any color palette you want, no matter which team you are in! To support this update, we’ve made major changes to the User Interface. You will always be in the blue team following this patch. This smoothens identification: blue elements are always your team’s; orange elements are always the enemies’. We've also added an outline to your teammates so you can spot them in the blink of an eye on the battlefield and plan your next moves. Please visit our blog post for more details on this update! Removed the Neutral/Attacker/Defender color palettes tabs. All color palettes are available in the same page and can be used in any game mode, no matter which team you are in. The neutral customization of each loadout will be kept once the patch is released You will now be in the blue team from now on, even if you are playing Attackers Added an outline to your teammates, visible at all times. This outline can be turned off in the User Interface option Teammates’ names are always displayed on-screen Health bars are now team colored Enemies detailed information (Name, Health, Stamina) is only displayed when engaged in a fight with them Players revealed by Feats or the Oracle Offering in Tribute will be shown as team colored outline and fill Players bearing Offerings in Tribute or the War Banner in Breach will now be shown with a team colored flashing fill Changed the default color for non-customized character to “Radioactive Decay”. The “Exotic” palette will still be unlocked by default IMPROVEMENTS GENERAL Replaced all dodges effects with a new ""dodge shadow effect"" for all Heroes All the Heroes now have their own base avatar when they dodge MAP Sentinel Capture Zone A The back staircases leading up to the zone have been doubled in width along with the extension of the capture zone area itself, which removes the path that ran along behind A brasero has been added in the middle of the Capture Zone area, which will protect Players from the Ballista Capture Zone C The entire 2nd floor is no longer part of Capture Zone C anymore. Instead, the 1st floor now is, and has been enlarged considerably The outdoor balcony area has been reduced in size The interior staircases leading to the outdoor balcony area (from spawn) have been widened by 0.5m Ziplines have been added at each tower, to the left and right of the 2nd floor Ballista, connecting to the Lower Ruins Ballista sightlines have been tweaked Duel The duel arena located in the Defender Courtyard has been moved to the 1st floor of the Tower Interior The trap door located on the Exterior Roof of the tower has been removed Brawl The brawl arena has been moved from the Tower to the Defender Courtyardr Developer’s Comment: Sentinel is the map that introduced Ballistas into PvP gameplay in For Honor. Its original design intent was to maximise the use of the Ballistas on the battlefield. Although it provided a very unique experience compared to other maps, it over-relied on camping strategies and navigation between objectives became secondary. With this update we wanted to bring speed and ease of navigation between objectives back to the forefront. It wasn’t our intention to simply remove the Ballistas but make them less attractive as a main strategy. Capture Zone A was not only one of the smallest Capture Zones in the game but also one of the most dangerous ones, with a prominent ledge and in direct line-of-sight from a Ballista. The back area of the zone was also very underutilized. The new open space allows Players to further distance themselves from the ledge and now provides added cover from the opposing Ballista. The other important change is that the run-distances between the Mid-Lane and Capture Zone C have been shortened considerably by moving the capture area to the entire first floor. Which in turn, no longer allows Players to interact with the ballista on the 2nd floor while still holding the zone. Our aim is to have the Ballista be a choice to consider and not a default action. Up until now, those who were using the ballista but no longer had any targets in sight, felt trapped on the 2nd floor with no easy means to move on to another area. This is where the newly added ziplines come in handy. Enjoy! Temp...",1600365818,
304390,PATCH NOTES 2.20.0 TO 2.20.2,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/b19c64613c8e8a74b9c02d4b5e0457ef6586b4e1.png In 2.20.0 Patch Notes, we incorrectly communicated that Vengeful Barrier Perk duration has been reduced to 10 seconds, the correct value for this Perk duration is 15 seconds. WARMONGER FEATS Corruption (Affects both Nuxia and Warmonger’s feats) Corruption is no longer triggered by having Soldiers from your team in the Area of Effect Corruption Blade Decreased active time before going to cooldown (without hitting a target) to 15 seconds (from 20) Increased Cooldown to 75 seconds (from 60) Corruption Blast Increased Cooldown to 180 (from 150) CORE COMBAT UPDATE ADJUSTMENTS STAMINA ADJUSTMENTS Attacks performed with Light Attack input now cost 9 stamina (from 12) with the following exceptions: Combo Lights now cost 6 stamina (from 12) Developer’s Comment: Combo Lights refers to Light attacks that are guaranteed after other Light or Heavy attacks (excludes Bashes) For example, this includes Warden's Side Light -> Light combo, Shaolin's Light -> Light -> Light combos, Shinobi’s Light -> Light combo, etc. Berserker's Light attack after Heavy Feints now cost 6 stamina (from 12) Developer’s Comment: Berserker’s Light attack after Heavy Feints are considered to be Combo lights, and as such should have cost 6 stamina. DAMAGE ADJUSTMENTS Developer’s Comment: We have adjusted the damage for multiple attacks. On average, Heavy Attacks deal less damage, and light attacks remain mostly the same, but there are some exceptions. The new damage values are closer to, but not identical, to Testing Grounds Week 2. We looked at community feedback and our own internal feedback and examined every attack in regard to its utility and properties and re-balanced their damage accordingly. This was done to ensure that fights last a bit longer, punishes are less damaging and players have more time to anticipate what their opponents do. We have also raised Zone Attack damage for the heroes that rely on them as their sole Guard Break punish. Aramusha Sprint Attack First Hit now deals 22 damage (from 24) Opener Side Heavies now deals 27 damage (from 26) Chain Top Heavy now deals 27 damage (from 28) Chain Side Heavies now deals 30 damage (from 31) Finisher Top Heavy now deals 31 damage (from 38) Finisher Side Heavies now deals 31 damage (from 38) Zone Attack Second Hit now deals 30 damage (from 22) Fury Unleashed now deals 24 damage (from 15) Twin Vipers now deals 32 damage (from 26) Ring the Bell now deals 15 damage (from 13) Berserker Boar Rush now deals 24 damage (from 26) Opener Top Heavy now deals 29 damage (from 32) Opener Top Heavy (after Feint) now deals 29 damage (from 32) Opener Right Heavy now deals 24 damage (from 29) Opener Left Heavy now deals 24 damage (from 29) Slashing Rush 1st Strike now deals 5 damage (from 4) Chain Top Light now deals 9 damage (from 12) Chain Left Light now deals 9 damage (from 12) Chain Right Light now deals 9 damage (from 12) Chain Left Heavy (Infinite) now deals 26 damage (from 28) Chain Left Heavy (Bear Mauler) now deals 26 damage (from 28) Chain Right Heavy (Infinite) now deals 26 damage (from 28) Chain Right Heavy (Bear Mauler) now deals 26 damage (from 28) Slashing Rush 2nd Strike now deals 5 damage (from 4) Finisher Top Heavy now deals 31 damage (from 38) Finisher Left Heavy now deals 34 damage (from 35) Finisher Right Heavy now deals 34 damage (from 35) Slashing Rush 3rd Strike now deals 6 damage (from 4) Head Slicer now deals 15 damage (from 13) Spin Chop now deals 15 damage (from 11) Zone Attack 1st Strike now deals 4 damage (from 3) Zone Attack 2nd Strike now deals 4 damage (from 3) Zone Attack 3rd Strike now deals 4 damage (from 3) Zone Attack 4th Strike now deals 4 damage (from 3) Black Prior Sprint Attack now deals 26 damage (from 30) Opener Top Heavy now deals 27 damage (from 32) Opener Left Heavy now deals 24 damage (from 29) Finisher Top Heavy now deals 28 damage (from 35) Finisher Left Heavy now deals 28 damage (from 35) Finisher Right Heavy now deals 28 damage (from 35) Bulwark Slash now deals 27 damage (from 35) Tenebris Thrust now deals 20 damage (from 24) Top Light Superior Block now deals 17 damage (from 19) Left Light Superior Block now deals 17 damage (from 19) Right Light Superior Block now deals 17 damage (from 19) Centurion Opener Top Heavy Partial Charge now deals 23 damage (from 26) Opener Top Heavy Full Charge now deals 27 damage (from 30) Opener Left Heavy Partial Charge now deals 23 damage (from 26) Opener Left Heavy Full Charge now deals 27 damage (from 30) Opener Right Heavy Partial Charge now deals 23 damage (from 26) Opener Right Heavy Full Charge now deals 27 damage (from 30) Finisher Top Heavy Partial Charge now deals 25 damage (from 28) Finisher Top Heavy Full Charge now deals 29 damage (from 30) Finisher Left Heavy Partial Charge now deals 25 damage (from 28) Finisher Left Heavy Full Charge now deals 29 damage (from 30) Finisher Right Heavy Partial Charge now deals 25 damage (from 28) Finisher...",1598553818,
