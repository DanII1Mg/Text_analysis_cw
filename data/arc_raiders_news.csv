1808500,COLD SNAP - December Update 1.7.0 Patch Notes,"Raiders, Frigid winds carve through the valleys of Blue Gate. Blizzards sweep across the abandoned spaceport while the Red Lakes freeze and crack. Raiders topside battle on as they shiver and stumble and swear.What’s New? Cold Snap Map ConditionFlickering Flames Event Expedition Departure Window New Free Raider Deck “Goalie”  - coming on December 26 New Quests and ItemsPatch HighlightsAdded Skill Tree Reset functionality.Added an option to toggle Aim Down Sights.Wallet now shows your Cred soft cap.Various festive items to get you into the holiday spirit.Moved the Aphelion blueprint drop from the Matriarch to Stella Montis.Added Raider Tool customization.Fixed various collision issues on maps.Improved Stella Montis spawn distance checks to address the issue of players spawning too close to each other. Balance ChangesWeapons:BettinaDev note: These changes aim to make the Bettina a bit less reliant on bringing a secondary weapon. The weapon should now be a bit more competent in PVP, without tipping the scales too much. Data shows that this weapon is still the highest performing PVE weapon at its rarity (Not counting the Hullcracker). The durability should also feel more in line with our other assault rifles.Durability Burn Rate has been reduced from ~0.43% to ~0.17% per shotIn practice, it used to take about 12 full magazines to fully deplete durability, but now it takes 26 (also accounting for the increased magazine size).Base Magazine Size has been increased from 20 to 22Base Reload Time has been reduced from 5 to 4.5 RattlerDev note: Even though the Rattler isn't intended to compete with the Stitcher or Kettle at close ranges, it is receiving a minor buff to bring its PVP TTK at lower levels a bit closer to the Stitcher and Kettle. The weapon should remain in its intended role as a more deliberate weapon where players are expected to dip in and out of cover, fire in controlled bursts, and manage their reloads.Base Magazine Size has been increased from 10 to 12 ARC:ShredderReduced the amount of knockback applied by weapons. Increased movement speed and turning responsiveness.Increased health of the Shredder's head to prevent cases where its head could be shot off, leading to unintended behavior.Improved Shredder navigation to reduce getting stuck on corners, narrow spaces, and short obstacles.Increased the speed at which the Shredder enters combat when taking damage and when in close proximity to players.Increased the number of parts on the Shredder that can be individually destroyed. Content and Bug Fixes AchievementsAchievements are now enabled in the Epic store.Animation Fixed an issue where picking up a Field Crate with a Trigger ’Nade attached could cause the character to slide or move without input.Fixed an issue where combining Snap Hook with ziplines or ladders could store momentum and propel the player long distances.Fixed an issue where the running animation could appear incorrect after a small drop when over-encumbered.Fixed interaction animations: interactions now end correctly when performing a dodge roll; interacting while holding items or deployables no longer causes arm twisting; updated crouch repair to use the correct animation.Added physical based secondary movement to character skins and equipment.ARCFixed an issue where deployables attached to enemies could cause them to launch or clip out of bounds when shot.Missiles no longer reverse course after passing a target and can correctly track targets at different elevations.SentinelFixed a bug where the Sentinel laser did not reach the targeted player over greater distances.SurveyorDisabled vaulting onto ARC Surveyors to prevent unintended launches when they are moving.Fixed an issue where Bombardier projectiles could shoot through the Matriarch shield from the outside.Audio Fixed an issue where Gas, Stun, and Impulse Mines did not play their trigger sound or switch their light to yellow when triggered by being shot.Increased the number of simultaneous footstep sounds and increased their priority.Fixed an issue where footsteps in metal stairs became very quiet when walking slowly.Improved directional sound for ARC enemies.Added sounds for sending and receiving text chat messages in the main menu.Removed the unsettling ""mom?"" from Speranza cantina ambient sound.Tweaked the loudness of announcements in various Main Menu screens.Number of small audio bugfixes and polish.Maps Fixed an issue with spawning logic which could cause players who were reconnecting at the start of a session to spawn next to other players who had just joined.Various collision, geometry, VFX and texture fixes that address gaps in terrain which made players fall through the map or walk inside geometry, stuck spots, camera clipping through walls, see-through geometry, floating objects, texture overlaps, etc.Fixed an issue with the slope of the Raider Hatch that was too steep for downed raiders to crawl on top of it.Security Lockers are now dynamically spawned across all map...",1765877642,['vo_marketing_message']

The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.Increased Weight from 2 to 5.Explosive DamageDev note: We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.Content and Bug FixesARCFixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.ShredderShredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.Shredder movement and handling updated: slightly reduced turn speed, improved braking, stiffer suspension, and more consistent reactions to impacts for steadier behavior in combat.Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.Audio Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.Maps Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.The Dam BattlegroundsFixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.SpaceportAdded collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.Blue GateFixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets; shots now pass through as expected.Stella MontisFixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.MiscellaneousFixed a crash when using Raider Voice (proximity chat) on PCs without AVX2 support.Fixed a crash that could occur when surrendering after reconnecting to a session.Fixed an issue where scavenging parts from the Shredder could leave behind invisible collisions.Fixed an issue where the Trials weekly rollover could display an outdated rank; the celebration now reflects the correct current rank and the UI remains accurate during the cooldown period.Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.Your Raider Den has been ducked out.Movement Improved enemy ground detection to better handle steep surfaces, reducing erratic movement when traversing angled terrain.Weapons AphelionFixed an issue where Aphelion tracers could become excessively bright at distance, reducing visibility for the player being shot at.Increased Aphelion blueprint drop rates.StitcherCorrected player facing stats for the Stitcher, showing incorrect scaling of reload time across upgrade levels.See you Topside,//Ossen And the ARC Raiders Team",1763632069,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1415716708_1763633777_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

It lends the looter shooter a gambolling giddiness you might not expect from its heavily laden packmule characters.

So on behalf of all of us, thank you!Speaking of tech tests, a big shoutout to all of you who showed up and played last month! Tech Test 2 was the best rehearsal we could get ahead of release this fall. You gave us thoughtful, sharp feedback, and the test helped us hone in on plenty of things we’re addressing in the last stretch of development: there are bugs to squash, as well as general polish and performance improvements to be done. We're fine-tuning game balance and the player economy, and will work on an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre. At release, the game will also be expanded, with more locations to explore, more ARC enemies to fight, a larger selection of weapons and gear to find and craft, more adventures to embark on, and more for players to strive towards and discover. As we get closer to October, expect more details on what ARC Raiders will bring on launch day, and how we plan to grow, evolve, and support ARC Raiders after release. So mark your calendars, gear up, and rally your crew. Pre-orders will open later this summer.

Last week, CGMagazine was invited to go hands-on with an early build of <em>ARC Raiders</em> and explore Embark’s vision of a lethal, post-post-apocalyptic Earth. After an excruciatingly tense nine-hour tour through three robot-infested hellscapes, I can report that <em>ARC Raiders</em> is shaping up to be a top-tier third-person sci-fi adventure — and one of the most distinctive extraction shooters to date. <em>ARC Raiders</em> is set in the distant future, long after Earth was devastated by a mysterious mechanical force called ARC. To escape their ruthless oppressors, humanity’s survivors retreated deep underground into bastion cities such as our home, Speranza. To keep Speranza alive, its bravest citizens — and a rooster named Scrappy — must return to the surface to scavenge the ruins, fill their backpacks with recyclable loot and race home before ARC forces... <a href=""https://www.cgmagonline.com/articles/previews/arc-raiders-hands-on-preview/"">Read more</a> ",1745910000,

On Wednesday, April 30th, we’re kicking off the ARC Raiders Tech Test 2, where invited playtesters on Steam, Epic Games Store, and consoles will be able to experience the deadly exploits of the Rust Belt, for five full days. This will be our largest test of ARC Raiders to date, for the first time also including players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Epic Games Store. The purpose of the test is to see how the game performs in a live environment across all launch platforms and gather key insights and feedback from players like you. This time around, you’re free to share or stream gameplay capture and tell the world of your experience in ARC Raiders — in other words, the playtest is not confidential. Sign up now for your chance to play ARC Raiders. So, what can I expect? For those who may need a refresher: ARC Raiders is a multiplayer extraction adventure, set in a lethal future earth, where little remains of the world we know today. On the surface, threats are everywhere: ARC machines loom high in the skies and lurk in the shadowy corners of abandoned spaceports and run-down warehouses. You’ll encounter everything from roaming rollbots to multi-legged behemoths, and the choice will be yours — team up to defeat them, or risk combat with your fellow Raiders if you'd rather keep the spoils for yourself. While the line between friend and foe is razor thin on the surface, in Speranza, you’ll find refuge. The Traders there are ready to supply you with quests and gear. You can also craft equipment in your Raider Den, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets. With every level gained on the surface, you can invest your experience into a branching skill tree. How do I get a chance to play? To join the Tech Test 2, you must request access either on our sign up page on Embark ID (link) or on Steam. If you get access, you will be notified over e-mail. If you have previously played an ARC Raiders playtest on Steam, you will gain immediate access to this test too (but you won’t be notified). You must be at least 16 years of age to participate in Tech Test 2. The full Tech Test Terms of Service are available here. Access is given randomly, and we will distribute invites gradually throughout the test — so if you don’t get an invite on day one, you may get one later! Can I stream or share gameplay online? Yes you can! Unlike previous playtests, this test is not confidential, and we encourage you to share your experience, record it, share with friends, or post on your favorite forum or social media site. Keep in mind though, that ARC Raiders remains in development and will see many tweaks, changes, and additions before launch. Anything else I should know? Here’s a link to a document we put together with some key details about ARC Raiders, the Tech Test 2, the experience of playing the game, an overview of some of the progression features, and more.

In theory. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/arc-raiders-everything-we-know"">I've written extensively about the game in the pas</a>t, and everything I loved about it back then still looks cool now - and it's even had a bit of a graphics upgrade. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/arc-raiders-2025-release-date-onl"">Read more</a> ",1724179438,
1808500,ARC Raiders is Coming in 2025 — PC Playtesting Starts This Fall,"Raiders! I’m Aleksander Gröndal, the executive producer on ARC Raiders! In case you missed it, we just announced some news about ARC Raiders at the Gamescom Opening Night Live show in Cologne (where I’m at right now). Let’s get into it. First things first, ARC Raiders will launch in 2025 here on Steam, as well as on the Epic Game Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and on cloud streaming via Nvidia GeForce Now. There will be opportunities for you to experience the game earlier than that. In around two months from now, between October 24 and October 27, we’re planning a first public Tech Test here on Steam. For an opportunity to play, make sure to sign up for Playtesting on our Steam store page. For this test, we will select participants randomly from our pool of playtesters. We’re also making an important change to our business model. You may recall that ARC Raiders was announced as a free-to-play game. Today, we announced that ARC Raiders will be released as a $40 premium title. There are many reasons for this change, and they all boil down to our conviction that a premium business model is a better fit for the type of game we’re building. A premium model allows us to create a more focused, balanced, and engaging action-survival experience. We also released a teaser, that you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8NN00Wtj5c I know it’s been some time since we talked about ARC Raiders, so here’s a refresher: In ARC Raiders you enter a vast and lethal world. People have fled to the underground colony of Speranza, seeking supplies to survive, and shelter from ARC machines on the surface. Demand for resources is at an all-time high, but venturing the surface to get them is a risky job. You’re a newly enlisted as a Raider, fighting for your own survival and that of your neighborhood in the underground colony — scavenging and hunting for resources that must be extracted back safely from the surface. Standing in your way are ARC machines — a mysterious, deadly foe — as well as other players — Raiders — who are also competing for loot and their own survival. To grow as a Raider, you must make it back down to the colony alive. There, you get to meet the traders of Speranza to trade your loot and valuables, embark on quests, upgrade and improve and expand your chambers, and grow your character to suit your playstyle — to become the Raider that you want to be. Whether teaming up or going solo, it’s a game that rewards thinking ahead and carefully observing the world around you, rather than running into action guns blazing. The gameplay is tactile, visceral, and grounded, with a rich and playful sandbox of gadgets and tools, beyond just guns and ammo. While ARC Raiders has changed and evolved over the course of development, the world we have built has always been our anchor. To cite Stefan Strandberg, our creative director, we’re drawing inspiration from current-day themes taken to their extreme — like the prospect of colonizing space, at a time when the relationship between man and machine is becoming increasingly fraught. It’s a game that takes place in a post-post apocalypse — a distant future where humanity has moved on to build anew. Surely, this world can be a dangerous and treacherous place — but at the same time, it’s inherently hopeful, vibrant, and charming. With the first Tech Test coming up in October, you should stay tuned for the latest updates and information on ARC Raiders here on Steam, via Embark’s Discord, arcraiders.com, Twitter / X, and YouTube. With that, I hope to see you in the Rust Belt. ",1724178914,
1808500,What’s next for ARC Raiders,"I am Aleks and I am the executive Producer for ARC Raiders here at Embark Studios. If you venture over to the Steam page for ARC Raiders, you might notice some changes in the way we describe the game. These changes are fundamental enough that we think it’s important to provide some context and describe in some more detail what kind of game ARC Raiders is. Last spring, we made the decision to move the release of ARC Raiders in order to focus on releasing THE FINALS, our team-based first-person shooter, as our first game. At that time, we also said we were giving the ARC Raiders team time to add PvP to the existing foundation of the game. Since then, over the course of development, ARC Raiders has taken the shape of what we believe to be a truly promising PvPvE survival extraction shooter — a game that stays true to the ARC Raiders universe and we’re having a blast testing internally. ARC Raiders drops players into a lethal but stunningly beautiful future earth, with hair-raising moments of survival and suspense. Human versus machine, human versus human, together or alone, and you versus the sometimes conflicting nature of your own humanity, all in the spectacular backdrop of a landscape littered with the haunting remains of the past. Here is an excerpt to help paint a picture of what you can expect at this time in our development of the game: ---- People have fled to the underground colony of Speranza, seeking supplies to survive, and shelter from the machines. Demand for resources is at an all-time high. But getting those resources is a risky job, and it isn’t for everyone. But it is a job for you. That’s why you’ve enlisted as a Raider, scavenging for vital supplies that are scattered across the 5landscape. Everything from leftovers from yesterday’s run-in with ARC to the unlikely remains of a pinball machine. Out there, the stakes are high, and you will have to fight for your loot. Lethal ARC machines roam the surface. And there are no rules in Calabretta, so beware of other Raiders. With the traders in Speranza, trust is hard-earned and easily lost. You need to earn your keep. So don't come back from a quest empty-handed. When you see another Raider chased by a swarm of ARC drones, do you go in for the kill? Do you lend a helping hand? Or do you hold back and feast on the valuable remains? ---- The next step for us is a Closed Alpha test to and get feedback on the game’s core systems and loops. This will be the first road test of ARC Raiders and an important step for the game, which so far has never been in the hands of external players. This test will be closed and under NDA, because work remains on the game and we’re not quite ready to reveal everything about it. We have some big theories to prove before it’s time to put them on the world’s stage. If you would like to give it a try and help us illuminate the path, we’d love for you to head on over and sign up for the opportunity to playtest this summer.

1808500,ARC Raiders | Reveal Trailer,"Raiders, ARC is on screen. Calling for volunteers. Enlist. Resist. A patchwork early warning system has alerted you and your squad of Raiders, a rogue group of resistance fighters, that enemies are dropping from orbit. It is time to defend our home. The ruthless, mechanized threat descending from space is known as ARC, and while the odds are stacked against you, unpredictability and diversity are the Raiders’ strengths. Do the unexpected using physics, your surroundings, and your wits in combat that demands more than simply matching ammo to a weapon. Lone wolves never make it very far when ARC is around, so you will need to fight, flee, and fine-tune, shoulder to shoulder with your squad. As a Raider, your approach is scrappy, but it's never half-hearted, and while you should come prepared, remember that sometimes you just have to wing it. Add to your wishlist now: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/ For us at Embark Studios, ARC Raiders will be our first release, coming 2022. We founded Embark Studios (Stockholm, Sweden) with the aim of doing more than merely noticing innovation when it comes to making games. We welcome and apply technologies that remove obstacles and help us to tap into our true creativity, and we invite you to join us on that journey. Warmly, Embark Studios ",1639158215,
