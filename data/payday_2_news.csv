218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 240.3 Changelog,"PAYDAY 2: Update 240.3 Changelog Update Size: 29.8MB General: All types of Bulldozers now count for the OVERGRILL achievement. Fixed an issue that caused pager outlines to not blink. Fixed an issue that would cause the tap to interact cancel prompt to revert to default prompt, for host player. Fixed an issue where a equipped mask that was tagged with a locked DLC remained equipped but locked in inventory. Heist Changes & Optimizations: The Biker Heist - Fixed an issue that would display an incorrect string when another player picks up the blowtorch from the mechanic. Bulucs Mansion - Fixed an visual issue with a clue book disappearing from view. White House - Fixed a possible crash for clients after starting the hack in PEOC. Optimized portals on Breakfast in Tijuana heist. Optimized portals on Dragon heist. Portals is a tool to create volumes within the level to decide what objects should be visible from within it; these volumes are local to the player and may have the results of improving performances with FPS. Network: Updated network syncing of player position and camera rotation to be more efficient. Gameplay: Reworked and optimized damage over time mechanics and how their effects are handled: All damage over time applications are now synced. If multiple players apply dot on an enemy, the last attacker is the one that deals damage and gets credited for the kill, but achievements that require a certain amount of enemies to be doted, can trigger for multiple people as long as they applied the dot. The grace period on dot application only applies once for a variant of dot, and never applies again unless it expires, meaning that continuing to attack will only benefit the player. Previously, fire encouraged applying dot and to not refresh it. Fire dot effects will no longer get removed for all affected enemies whenever any fire dot expires. Burning sounds from fire dot will now follow the enemy they're applied to instead of being static on the spot. The Moneythrower will now properly apply fire damage over time with the unique money effects. Both burning sounds and fire effects will get removed if the enemy is despawned, instead of continuing to play and float around, respectively. Enemies that die while doing animations, like climbing and similar, will no longer snap into place when dying to fire damage, and will instead ragdoll like with any other damage sources. Projectiles that detonate are now hidden properly for both clients and host when needed (after detonation). They also no longer use a timer that requires the projectile to update, saving some performance. Fixed some issues of some dots, from incendiary explosions, not applying properly. Tweaked the duration of some fire death effects and burning sounds to not end too abruptly. Cloakers hiding behind doors should no longer get stuck behind them when attempting to leave. Weapons: Added a weapon firing input buffer to alleviate issues with single shot weapons not firing as expected, when trying to rapid-fire them. Animations: Fixed an issue where getting tased, while using a weapon in ""volley"" fire mode, would cause some animation issues. It should now only affect the weapon, not the player arms. Added a potential fix for enemies popping in for a frame during spawn animations. Fixed it so animation freezing works properly. Some animations will now properly freeze at certain points when not in the highest level of animation detail to save performance. If any sort of animation needs to be played, animations are unfrozen again until it's possible to freeze again. Fixed root blending on NPCs always being disabled. This should make most animations overall look smoother. Recoil animations can now play while moving. Recoil animations no longer break crouching and standing, where it was causing units to not crouch or stand when wanting to, which could lead to desync. Reload and recoil animations now transition between standing and crouching properly. Bulldozer recoil animations should now be much smoother. Recoil animations on the Minigun Dozer are also more ""punchy"". Bulldozers and Shields can now flinch against damage (purely cosmetic). Fixed an issue causing Shields to play the wrong hurt animations when staggered by skills, resulting in them clipping with their own shield. Fixed some issues causing dodge animations to blend too aggressively and end too early, resulting in the unit not moving much. Fixed enemies playing panic animations sometimes not exiting them properly and remain crouching in place doing nothing. Fixed some issues with bullpup animations snapping. Achievements: We have updated the requirements for the completion of certain Achievements. Read up more on it from here. The affected Achievements and their updated requirements are listed below: Say Hello to My Big Friend - On the Scarface Mansion job, kill the boss on the OVERKILL difficulty and above. Nothing Personal - Kill 30 snipers with any Sniper Rifle on the OVERKILL difficulty or a...",1701271216,['patchnotes']

218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 240.2 Changelog,"Hello Heisters As you noticed Update 240 was separated into multiple releases. We've had some time to add some QOL and fixes that are hard to fit into a normal production schedule. We are very happy to be able to get these final improvements into the game. For example, in update 240.0 we made the anniversary events automatically return each year the piggy, and the event weapons will come back for those who can get enough of that adorable porker. Also, some holiday cheer will come back around the winter holidays to brighten up our cold heister hearts. In this release, however, we are adding a new feature to the game that is inspired by popular mods in the community. Interaction Styles This feature lets you change how the game handles interactions. The system will lock interaction to let you release the button and avoid holding it down for the duration of the interaction timers. To cancel out of a locked interaction you simply need to press the button again. It is quite a complex system so it needs some explaining, Let's dive into the fun QOL feature. By looking under ""controls"" under the options menu you will find all the settings you need. The system has two key components the ""Interaction Style"" where you choose how the interactions should be handled and the ""Toggle Timer"" that drives the system. There are four interaction styles to choose from. There is also a cancel message check box more on that later. Hold This is the normal default behavior that you are used to. Holding the button to interact, and letting go will cancel the interaction. The Toggle Timer has no effect in this mode. Toggle This is the simplest way to lock an interaction. A quick click of the button and the interaction is locked. The toggle timer will be used to determine how long you need to hold the button to cancel the interaction. this is to easily cancel out accidental interactions or when you want to be able to quickly abort an interaction. Setting the Toggle Timer to 0 will make the system function similar to the default hold mode. For example: if you have a Toggle Timer of 2 seconds the interaction will lock as soon as you press the button but if you hold the button for longer than those 2 seconds the system will revert to the hold mode and you can release their interaction at will. Recommendation: Have a low Toggle Timmer so you can quickly engage the system but also won't need to wait long for it to deactivate if you choose to hold the interaction instead. Timed Toggle This function can be viewed as the reverse of the Toggle. You need to hold the button for a certain amount of time determined by the Toggle Timer before the interaction locks in and keeping the button held will not abort it. Setting the Toggle Timer to 0 will make the system function similar to the Toggle mode, without the ability to automatically abort the interaction by keeping the button held down. For example: if you have a Toggle Timer of 2 seconds the interaction will function as a normal hold interaction until you've held it for at least 2 seconds then you can release the button and the interaction is locked. Recommendation: Have a medium Toggle Timmer so short interactions will be effectively held interaction but the system helps you with most interactions of average length and longer like setting up a drill. Adaptive Toggle This is a merge between the Toggle and a Hold depending on how long the interaction is as determined by the Toggle Timer. If the interaction is longer than what is set in the Toggle Timer the interaction will instantly look in if it is shorter then it will function like a Hold. Setting the Toggle Timer to 0 will make the system function similar to the Toggle mode, without the ability to automatically abort the interaction by keeping the button held down. For example: if you have a Toggle Timer of 2 seconds the interaction will function as a normal hold interaction for any interaction that is shorter than 2 seconds and if the interaction is longer it will lock in instantly when you press the button and keep the button held will not abort it. Recommendation: Have a higher Toggle Timmer so short interactions will be effectively held interaction but the system takes over for long interactions like picklocks. You know that the interaction has been locked in by the message on the screen, it will change to ""Press F to cancel"", assuming you have F as your interaction key. If you want you can also get these messages while holding to interact. By selecting the ""Cancel messages during hold"" you will get messages like ""release F to cancel"" during the hold interactions.

218620,PAYDAY 2 - 10th Anniversary Event Complete!,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/e647d37990f982ac91dc665fd71042731fb20327.png Well heisters, that wraps up the 10 year celebration of PAYDAY 2, we hope you’ve enjoyed taking this journey with us. If you missed any of the days, you’ll still be able to access the event website and view the days separately. We started celebrating with a very special 10-hour stream. The first 7 hours were hosted by Almir, he was joined by guests from the development team and told lovely stories about his memories from years past. The remaining 3 hours were hosted by our friends and former OVERKILL founders now at 10 chambers. They likewise told stories about their time developing PAYDAY 2. We followed up with a memory wall, letting you heisters share your memories from PAYDAY 2 with the rest of the community. Friendships found, good times had and a lot of stolen goods later, 10 years passed. We’ve loved seeing your stories heisters, we hope to hear them from you for years to come. Of course, it wouldn't be much of a celebration if there were no in-game items, right? So we added a whole bunch of items and tied them to a community challenge. What brings heisters together more than working together for profit? The event revolves around feeding a giant golden piggy with the fruits of excessive violence. Check out the details and what items have been unlocked on the event page. We got the soundtracks updated! The Original Soundtrack Vol.2 by Simon Viklund and later the Chinatown Music Pack by Gustavo Coutinho were both added to spotify after what can only be described as a truckload of legal tape. We hope you enjoy them both! Next, the lost tapes! What were they, what story did they convey? Who’s after the Payday Gang and why did the Gang come back from retirement in PAYDAY 3? We added a helpful link to one of our partners who made a handy video. To the bottom of this day’s event page. Next up was the Live Action teaser! We’ve seen a lot of heisters doubting that we’d return to making live action, fortunately for everyone, we did! Check out the teaser here. You can also now see the full version here. Where would PAYDAY be without modding? Hard to say, but we feel grateful to our modding community regardless. We made a donation to mod workshop and encouraged our heisters to check out modding if they haven’t before. The Thank You video, a heartfelt thank you from the PAYDAY 2 team to you, without whom this would all have been for nothing. Our appreciation is hard to impart in just one video, but we hope you know that we do appreciate your support. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/b4ff12019dac94b8c7dd477536b2734494448d3e.png Dead Game suit! Now you can match in-game and out. It might feel a bit dark, but remember that this isn’t an end, but the start of something new - and hopefully great. See you on crime.net heisters. The cross-promotional event where you can use your PAYDAY 2 achievements to unlock items in PAYDAY 3 will continue to run even after the event. So get those achievements done so you can show your legacy heister credentials when PAYDAY 3 launches! Keep those helmets flying OVERKILL_Tobias",1692956190,

218620,PAYDAY 2: Coming price changes for certain regions,"What’s happening? Some of you have noticed not being able to participate in the ongoing PAYDAY 2 sale, or might have heard from friends that they are having issues. The most common issue is that items on sale are available and visible, but the buy-button is grayed out. This is due to a recent change in Steam’s pricing policy that changed the minimum acceptable price of any piece of content on the Steam Store to $0.99 as standard, or $0.49 on sale.. This limit is the same, in USD, regardless of what currency you make your actual purchase in. These problems are particularly noticeable in heavily discounted bundles, something we use often to discount PAYDAY 2. When one of the DLCs in a bundle costs less than the minimum limit of $0.49 on sale, the whole bundle will become unavailable for purchase. If you’d like to know more about how this works, start with the blog post linked above! What’s changing? Due to this, we’ll need to raise the prices of our DLCs in certain regions to ensure that the bundles are purchasable and that we can set the discounts at the levels we want going forward. We wanted to let you know ahead of time, to give you a chance to purchase the DLCs you want at their current price if possible. If not, they should be available for their regular, non-discounted price for a short period of time before the base price is increased. Will this affect my region? There’s no one answer since it’s very likely many regions will see some minor change. Smaller changes may occur even in regions where the issues aren’t as readily apparent. We also expect a few DLCs to get lower prices as part of this change, but assume you guys are cool with that. Going forward, we'll mostly rely on the standard pricing matrix provided by Valve. Doing so will “normalize” the price of PAYDAY 2 when compared to other titles on the platform. More information here. The countries we know for a fact will see an increase are Turkey and Argentina who have been having issues related to this for an extended period. Infamous Collection If the issues mentioned above have been relevant anywhere, it’s been the Infamous Collection. In this brand new bundle, we collected all available PAYDAY 2 DLC at a permanent 52% discount. This setup caused some of the DLCs to fall below the $1 limit for a number of regions, prompting us to expedite these pricing changes. We apologize for the inconvenience, our goal is to change as little as possible while making the game available for more people.

218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 239.2 Changelog,"PAYDAY 2: Update 239.2 Changelog Update Size: 5.5 MB After fixing the previous issue with the side-job which was not triggering correctly, we noticed that for a lot of players, the side-job still did not unlock as expected. This new issue happened to players who had completed the personal part of the side job before the hotfix went live. We can finally say that this issue has now been addressed and we hope you will enjoy the musket for the rest of the event.

218620,PAYDAY 2: 10th Anniversary in-game Event Starting!,"Hello Heisters! Can you believe PAYDAY 2 has been around for a whole 10 years? Indeed heisters, thanks to you, we’ve managed to keep delivering new PAYDAY content since 2013. We’ve been celebrating since this Sunday when we hosted a massive 10-hour stream, we had guests, gameplay, and reminisced about the years past together with our viewers. In case you missed it, you can watch both parts of the 10-hour stream here. Tuesday, we announced the Infamous Collection. Which is practically every PAYDAY 2 DLC currently still available in one package, for the ultimate collector! Yesterday also marked the start of a grand anniversary sale! Check it out on our store page. https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/ The Event Rejoice heisters! Today marks the return of the most popular porcine payday pal, the golden piggy! Whatever heister is having this fever dream must’ve eaten something horrid. You might recognize elements of previous community events for this one, though Mr. Piggy has gone through some… improvements. Bigger, stronger, piggier! TL;DR - defeat enemies to feed the pig, once the pig grows big enough for you, smash it, and make off with the rewards! To explain it a bit more thoroughly… Defeating enemies will cause them to drop piggy bucks, remember to check the side-jobs to see what you can unlock and what you need to do. How you defeat enemies will affect how efficiently you gain piggy bucks, you’ll get 1 piggy buck for every: 5 headshots kills 10 body shot kills 5 cash blaster kills 1 kill with either of the two available event weapons The piggy will then feast on the fruits of your labor! To put it simply, throw the piggy bucks into the pig to make it grow, the bigger it gets the more you’re rewarded. The piggy will grow in up to 5 stages, each stage will grant you a random buff such as faster run speed while carrying bags, increased drill speed, or less damage taken. You can choose to get out before the piggy is full if you smash it early, your reward will depend on what stage the piggy was in, so the more you risk the more you stand to gain. For every 3 million piggy bucks the PAYDAY 2 community collects, we’re upping the ante and providing rewards! Check out the event page to see what the community can earn! Do note that we use telemetry in order to track the progression of this event, so if your telemetry is turned off, your contributions will not count. Check here for how to turn it on or off. The event starts today August 16th and will run until August 22th Play PAYDAY 2 to unlock items in PAYDAY 3 You ask, we deliver! We’ve been getting the question for a while now, “is there any way to show my accomplishments in PAYDAY 2 when playing PAYDAY 3”. Well, now you can! We’ve created a list of challenges from PAYDAY 2 which will lead to rewards in PAYDAY 3. The challenges are varied but all tied to achievements. The wise heister might use the in-game achievement tracking UI located from the main menu to keep an eye on their progress. This campaign will continue for at least a while after the launch of PAYDAY 3, so if you don’t have time to finish everything now, you may do so in the future. There are more details of how the technical aspects will work on the event website. Lost Tapes 4 Another lost tape is located, grab it to hear what the enemies of the Payday Gang are up to.

Fixed an issue that allowed players to stand on top of some invisible collision, on the stairs leading up to the oil puzzle. Fixed an issue that allowed bloodstains to visually appear on props that were not present in the security room. Fixed a collision issue, near the docking area, that allowed the player's head to clip through a pipe. Fixed an issue that allowed bags to become stuck on a ladder connected to the big yellow crane, just outside the locker room. Heists Fixed a crash that occurred on the Black Cat and Golden Grin Casino heists when the player attempted to pick up their gear. Along with other similar heists where it randomly could crash. Matchmaking Updated CRIME.NET to display friends' lobbies first, as a priority, before public lobbies. Fixed an issue where inviting favorite heisters sometimes did nothing on the social hub through steam Fixed some issues with matchmaking that allowed Crime Spree and Holdout lobbies to be displayed under the Heists filter. Consequently, the issue related to this where the player became soft-locked if they used game mode filters, which needed a game restart, was also fixed. Fixed an issue that blocked modded players' lobbies from being displayed on CRIME.NET.

218620,PAYDAY 2 Matchmaking & Crude Awakening Heist Delay,"Hello Heisters We’re writing this to address your feedback and the state of the game following update 237. Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to report bugs and leave feedback, it might sound strange given the nature of the feedback in this case, but we really do rely on and appreciate it. We are very sorry for all the issues you’ve had to endure. We did everything we could think of to make the process as unnoticeable as possible, but didn’t reach all the way. We tested everything we could think of and really did put in hours trying to figure out how to best implement the update without any negative side effects. Needless to say, we missed the mark in a few key areas. Below, we’ll go through the big-ticket items. What we intend to fix as well as share information on what we didn’t explain properly the first time. We want to do right by our players, you deserve as much. Matchmaking Matchmaking is facing a combination of problems that we are trying to fix. It is difficult to tackle them all at once. We’re going to need to iterate to get this right, meaning there will be a series of smaller updates taking care of the matchmaking issues one step at a time. During this time, we’ll rely on your feedback to make sure we’re moving in the right direction. We are committed to fixing the matchmaking issues for all players. The complexity of the issue we need to ensure it’s working properly however, so we’re not ready to commit to any date for when the fix will be in place. Data sharing We know a lot of you are rightly concerned about your data and who gets it, we hope we can reassure you that nothing nefarious is happening. To make sure we’re accurate, we confirmed the following with our programmers. In summary, the only data that gets sent to the matchmaking service is your public Steam ID. No other company not specifically mentioned in our terms of service gets access to your data in any way if you play via Steam, there’s no data beyond your public Steam ID being sent outside of the Steam environment. In fact, one of the reasons matchmaking isn’t functioning as you’re used to is that we don’t even share basic location information. Going forward we will be including what country you are matchmaking from in order to ensure a better matchmaking ping for everyone. Linux Linux is a complicated beast. To get the game working on both native Linux and at the same time updating the older version of the diesel engine that PAYDAY 2 for Linux was using proved unfeasible. This was one of the things we spent the most time trying to solve, yet didn’t reach our goals in the end. Linux players can still access the game using Proton, we’ll keep testing new updates with Proton to make sure it keeps working for the upcoming patches and releases. Crude Awakening Heist Delay Lastly, to give us more time to focus on the above-mentioned solutions, we’re delaying the upcoming heist release by a week, from June 20th until June 27th. This will give us more time to implement a few of the matchmaking fixes before the heist is out and you need to start finding games for it. OVERKILL_Tobias ",1686752734,

The individual DLC will be available, but the bundle will not due to the fact we are not certain whether or not it will function properly for Linux. https://store.steampowered.com/sub/845566/ McShay Weapon Pack 4 In this latest shipment from Gemma McShay she provides 3 powerful and unique weapons. The Deimos is a versatile shotgun able to swap between high fire rate and high power depending on whatever the situation needs. The Amaroq 900 sniper is a powerhouse and an excellent choice for anyone either at long range or peeking corners nearby. The Campbell 74 is a brutal LMG able to spit rounds down-range at incredible speeds, when the enemy is too close for comfort, merely swap to the underbarrel flamethrower and burn them toast. The Deimos shotgun comes with 9 unique weapon mods, and an Exclusive Set. The Amaroq 900 comes with 12 unique mods, 1 mod compatible with other sniper rifles and 2 Exclusive Sets, one of which is modeled after the infamous Dragon Lore from CS:GO. The PAYDAY 2 version might be the closest many of us get to owning this absolute treasure! A massive thanks goes out to Valve for letting us use the Dragon Lore skin! The Campbell 74 comes with 7 unique mods and an Exclusive Set. https://store.steampowered.com/app/2353510/PAYDAY_2_McShay_Weapon_Pack_4/ Weekly Stream For those of you that haven’t yet tuned in, we’re live on Twitch and YouTube (almost) every Tuesday and Thursday.

218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 236 Changelog,"Update 236 Changelog Update size: 502.1MB Heist Fixes Hostile Takeover - Fixed a graphical issue with a prop inside one of the offices. Hostile Takeover - Body bags are now able to be thrown into the water, surrounding the ramp, closest to the guard booth. Hostile Takeover - Fixed a small collision issue, on a doorframe in the lab area, that could impede player movement. Hostile Takeover - Fixed some graphical issues that appeared on the lab staff when in certain animation states. Midland Ranch - Fixed an exploit with the golf cart that allowed the duplication of loot bags. Midland Ranch - Fixed a collision issue that would allow players to leave the playing space. Weapon & Mods Fixes Increased dot damage for Flamethrower Mk.1 from 30 > 55 Increased dot damage for MA-17 Flamethrower from 30 > 42 Fixed an issue that caused a broken weapon model to appear on Crew AI, when equipping them with a Rattlesnake Sniper Rifle. Fixed a graphical issue on the Z5 Owl Glass Universal Scope that made it appear white on AMD GPUs and black on Nvidia GPUs, when Use HQ Weapons was set to OFF. Fixed a graphical issue with the 45 Degree Ironsights that caused it to lose textures, from a third person perspective, when Use HQ Weapons is set to OFF. Fixed a graphical issue that occurred when the North Star Sniper Rifle was equipped with both a stock and the exclusive skin. Fixed an issue that caused underbarrel ammo type mods to apply some of their stats to the main weapon, and vice versa. Fixed underbarrel ammo type mods not applying their stats properly, like ammo pickup multipliers. Fixed isses with Cassian Sharp & Elite Sight mod when used on certain weapons. Shotgun fixes and improvements Updated and optimized shotgun pellet raycast code to be in line with standard weapon raycast code (this also received a few optimizations). Fixed an issue where shotguns that have penetration capabilities and fire multiple pellets would result in unexpected visual behavior, where they only seem to fire one pellet (even though this wasn't the case). Shotgun pellets can now penetrate glass and some surfaces like other weapons do, and will go through obstacles that previously blocked them (like team AI, converted cops, corpses, popped helmets, etc). Except for HE Rounds, those will still detonate on the first thing they hit regardless. Shotgun pellets will now check for priority over different bodies when multiple land on the same target on different bodies, causing the impact on the one with highest priority, instead of the first one that got hit. This also works in reverse where, if hitting something like an invulnerable body on a turret, or body armor on a heavy swat unit, when no important bodies were hit, non-important bodies will be prioritized. Shields are now only damaged once when hit by multiple pellets, similarly to characters, but full damage is dealt instead of being divided by the amount of pellets. The Close By Ace skill now properly increases the rate of fire of any shotgun as long as it's firing in single shot and from the hip, as the skill description states. Shotgun pellets won't cause noise at the end of their raycast when nothing is hit, to be in line with other weapons. Fixed an issue where the Buckshot 000 and AP Slug ammo mods for the Locomotive 12G and Street Sweeper 12G shotguns had an incorrect description string assigned, stating that the ammo type is harder to find. General tweaks & fixes VR - Fixed a VR issue that caused the prompt to leave a golf cart, to appear behind the player, in the back of the vehicle. Tweaked the calculations for the player screen concussion effect to not stack as much and last for so long. The Marshal Shield's shotgun concussion rounds don't last as long. Players now comment on getting blinded by flashbangs or the Marshal Shield's flash Updated the Head Games card, of the Copycat deck, with more information. Fixed a Leech rounding error that could make players die when the Leech effect ended, even if they had health remaining/restored Updated the Copy Cat deck's Armor card text and functionality to give more bonus Armor and increased Armor Recovery rate. Fixed an issue for drop-ins where shields dropped by Marshal Shields didn't enable physics and could obstruct movement of players Fixed an issue where auto aim didn't move where the bullet tracer visuals are supposed to go, when the player would've missed a shot but auto aim kicked in and redirected it Fixed a graphical issue with Gas Grenades that made them appear white on AMD GPUs and black on NVIDIA GPUs. Updates may be incompatible with the mods you may have installed. Even seemingly unrelated mods may cause unexpected issues. If you are experiencing any issues with the game; try removing any mods you may have installed and try again. If you are having issues with an unmodded game you can try to verify the integrity of the game files. In the steam library; right click on PAYDAY 2. Select """"Properties"""" from the menu.

Thank you for all your feedback from the Hostile Takeover campaign, we love seeing your video’s, comments and reviews. We read as many as we are able and appreciate it all. Meanwhile, the PAYDAY team has been hard at work creating more PAYDAY for the consumption of its ever-hungry audience. To start showing off, we’re launching the Crude Awakening Bundle and the Lawless Tailor Pack. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/5290a5ff170345b976950314798821410138d52c.png We’ve been in Texas for 4 whole Tailor Packs and not a single cowboy outfit?

As with the previous bundles, we bundle up 4 DLCs at a lowered price, giving you - our most hardened heisters - a discount for picking up the bundle early. The bundle will contain 4 DLCs including the Tailor Pack released today. The other three DLCs will be released over the course of the next few months and will contain a Weapon Pack, a Music Pack and a Heist. Linux & VR The Crude Awakening Bundle, specifically the heist, will not be sold on Linux. This is due to technical issues born from the fact that the Linux and VR versions of PAYDAY are on a separate, and older, branch of PAYDAY 2. Until we've had the chance to investigate the issues we're facing around the older branches, we've set the Crude Awakening Bundle as unavailable for Linux and we're setting the Heist as not compatible with VR. As a consequence of the separate branches, there is a risk going forward that Linux and VR players will be unable to matchmake with Windows players until we've found a solution. We'll update as we get more information on how we'll proceed. Weekly Stream For those of you that haven’t yet tuned in, we’re live on Twitch and YouTube (almost) every Tuesday and Thursday.

218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 235 Changelog,"Update 235 Changelog Update size: 109.1MB General Fixed clients executing multiple elements for damage zones or fall damage disabling, causing them sometimes to take damage permanently (or not block fall damage) after entering them sometimes or when they get disabled while the player is inside. Made so the code makes them run locally and to not depend on latency has been further reworked and now it accounts for zones that might not work on clients, letting them run by the server first as usual. Changed how ammo pickup multipliers from weapon mods apply in the pickup calculation. They now affect the base pickup. This makes them work more as you'd expect and prevent issues when pickup bonuses are involved. Fixed an oversight from last update causing weapons with no ammo pickup to still grab ammo pickups, despite granting nothing. Added missing levels to the One More Down, No More To Go Achievement. Fixed an issue of where Tag Team Perk deck was using wrong values in its description Heist Fixes Hostile Takeover - Fixed an issue that could hinder player movement in the area outside the Document Storage room. Hostile Takeover - Adjusted Locke's VO priority when the player uses the PA system to lure scientists out of the laboratory. Hostile Takeover - Fixed an issue that would not count any loot secured past 20 bags. Tweaked XP values on various heists rewarding no XP for additional bags. Breakfast In Tijuana: Changed bag exp values from 0 to 1000 per bag Bank Heists (All 4 variations): Changed bag exp values from 0 to 500 per bag Firestarter day 3: Changed bag exp values from 0 to 500 per bag Election Day, day 2: Changed bag exp values from 0 to 500 per bag Election Day, day 3: Changed bag exp values from 0 to 1000 per bag Golden Grin Casino: Changed bag exp values from 0 to 500 per bag (including mandatory loot from 250 to 500 as well) UI Updated the Payday Kart 64 Achievement Icon to accurately reflect the time needed. Weapons Fixed an issue on the Kang Arms X1 Sniper Rifle that caused the character to grab the weapon as if there was a grip attached, after using the Inspire skill. Fixed an issue of where the magnifier second sight remained zoomed in after throwing a grenade or using melee Speedpull magazines now also apply the following penalties: 1 concealment 8 stability 4 accuracy The total ammo and ammo pickup on the RUS-12 Angry Tiger revolver and the Breaker 12G shotgun have been adjusted: ! RUS-12 Total ammo: from 15 to 40 Ammo pickup: from 0.25-0.75 to 0.2-0.6 It should now feel more similar to how the 5/7 feels to a Deagle, but with other revolvers. ! Breaker 12G Total ammo: from 21 to 28 Ammo pickup: 0.21-0.735 to 0.28-0.98 Adjusted ammo pickup multipliers from weapon mods accordingly. Added pickup multipliers to grenade launcher ammo types, in the same way. Details for what the pickups would result into without any bonuses (min-max): ! DMR kits CAR-4 Rifle: 1.125-2.475 AK Rifle: 1.125-2.475 AMR-16 Rifle: 1.08-2.43 AK.762 Rifle: 1.08-2.43 KS12 Urban: 1.08-2.43 Gewehr 3 Rifle: 1.19988-2.69973 ! Assault kits and similar (more ammo, less damage): Gewehr 3, Assault Kit: 4.49955-8.09919 Akron HC, Aureate Exclusive Set: 5.6-11.4 ! Other Broomstick, Precision Barrel: 0.495-1.7325 Grenade launcher ammo pickups have been adjusted. Thanks to the recent ammo pickup changes, values lower than 0.5 can result in ammo due to stacking, allowing more flexibility with design. As such, we're making these weapons that have extreme ease of use and no skill investment, require a bit more decision making on the player for when to use them, as they can be spammed too much due to their current pickups. Most of them will require around 4-5 pickups (accounting for the Walk-In Closet perk deck bonus), but underbarrels require double the amount. Here are the changes in detail to the base pickups: Basilisk 3V: 0.25-0.3 Piglet: 0.25-0.3 GL40: 0.15-0.2 China Puff: 0.15-0.2 Arbiter: 0.15-0.2 Compact 40mm: 0.15-0.2 Little Friend Underbarrel: 0.075-0.1 KETCHNOV Byk-1 Underbarrel: 0.075-0.1 Lastly, based on the ammo pickup changes for grenade launchers overall, their ammo types receive multipliers for their base pickups mentioned above. Mentioning each specific change would make this list significantly longer so only the multipliers are mentioned. Default is 1x for reference: Sting: 1.2x X1-a Tactical ZAPper: 0.8x Incendiary: 0.6x Viper: 0.4x"" Marshal tweaks Fixed an issue with the U.S Marshal Shield where the range of the concussion stun AOE, from hitting a light as it's charging up, was using the range of the flash instead. Buffed the stun range to compensate, now matching a player concussion grenade. Fixed an issue that would allow clients to kill the U.S Marshal Shield unit instantly, after breaking their shield, and an issue that would also cause no outline to appear, for the client, to indicate invulnerability. The U.S Marshal Sharpshooter will now be called out when killed, like a Sniper. They do not count as such units though A...",1679493147,['patchnotes']

218620,PAYDAY 2: Hostile Takeover Heist,"Hello Heisters! We started off this journey last year with the Street Smart Tailor Pack in November, followed by the McShay Mod Pack in December. Lastly, lightening up the otherwise cold and dark February, we got not only the McShay Mod Pack but are now also getting the Hostile Takeover Heist. This newest heist focuses on putting choice in the hands of the heister. Each objective can be started independently and done in whatever order you find most efficient, the order you chose might even affect events elsewhere in the heist. So after getting familiar with the heist and getting to know the objectives, try to experiment and see what you can make happen! If you’re confident in the abilities of your team and you are enviably unafraid of Cloakers, you can even do several objectives at once. These unique new mechanics makes the Hostile Takeover heist stand out among its peers, as if that wasn’t enough, this heist has one of what could be the most epic entry method in PAYDAY history. We look forward to seeing you on CrimeNet! Texas Heat Recap Gun runner Gemma McShay invited us to Texas and directed the Gang to the Midland Ranch in order to find intel to use against her biggest rival, and get away with some powerful new weaponry. While Gemma combed through the intel, we raided a train yard in order to liberate some valuable printing plates on their way to a mint facility. Completing the Lost in Transit finally gained us the trust of the man behind our Texas misadventures. Hostile Takeover Heist We’re introduced to Gemma's employer, Blaine Keegan. Now armed with the knowledge we gained from the Midland Ranch, Keegan sends us to strike a blow at his main opposition, CEO of SERA Inc, Alice Rainey. Keegan sends us to her company's main office and tasks us to find dirt on her shady dealings. In addition, we’re tasked with stealing a green energy prototype, the loss of which will strike a critical blow to SERA Inc. The choices are in your hands on how to tackle this heist. Completing different objectives in different order will create various effects around the heist, such as electrifying areas, causing walls to be blown up and much more. Play the heist and discover what you can make happen! US Marshal Shields join the fight The US Marshals Shields have decided to go on the hunt after our recent actions in Texas. From now on, you’ll be seeing Marshal Shield units outside of the Texas heists. If you’re unfamiliar with the units, they carry a lighter version of the ballistic shield you’re already experienced with. Unlike the regular shields, the Marshal shields are equipped with high-intensity flashlights, capable of blinding anyone standing in front of them. In exchange for that advantage, these shields are breakable if you put enough shots in them. Just because their shields get broken don’t mean that these guys just give up though! Marshals will swap to their secondary weapon, able to fire concussive rounds at anyone standing against them. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/e13e4cd3ae9fabb1407e2ee948b7b253680163b5.jpg Twitch Drops For all those of you that like freebies, we got you!

218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 234 Changelog,"Update 234 Changelog Update size: 767.8MB We're releasing with a possible crash on Hotline Miami Heist - Day 1 following the destruction of the gas station. There's already a fix being worked on and we hope to get it out as soon as possible. General Reworked damage zones (like fire and tear gas from some levels) to not depend on latency for client players, as well as to further reduce cases of the effects persisting forever until going into custody. Similar to the above, clients should now be able to safely jump onto the blankets in Lab Rats from great heights and consistently not die from fall damage, like the host does. Fixed Graze not passing weapon data when dealing damage. This allows it to count for sniper kills (such as for challenges, sidejobs or achievements). Multikills requirements still require the main bullet to count as such, as usual. Fixed an issue that caused the Rodion 3B Rifle's volley fire mode to count towards the Field Test achievement. Fixed some issues with the concussion accuracy penalty multiplier. It should work more consistently and as expected. It will also sync to drop-ins. Fixed an issue with modified enemy health syncing to drop-ins. Temporary invulnerability will now also sync to drop-ins. Optimized area trigger filtering code, fixed some specific bugs with it, and made a few more filters allow clients to sync status to the host to make things more responsive. Ammo pickups that normally result in no ammo are now stored and accumulate with more pickups to gain ammo. Weapon fixes Fixed an issue that caused the new suppressors to have zero threat decrease. Fixed an issue that caused bullets in the Aran G2 Sniper Rifle to appear as if they had not been properly ejected, or reloaded, when a weapon colour had been applied. Fixed a graphical issue that occurred on low FOV while using the Aran G2 Sniper Rifle & Perfect Blue Exclusive Set. Fixed a specific crash with Body Expertise if a unit has no headshot multiplier set. Fixed an issue with an animation on the Rodion 3B Rifle that stopped the player from interacting with anything until the animation was complete. Fixed a graphical issue that would occur on a Military Red Dot Sight on the Aran G2 Sniper Rifle, with the exclusive set, when another player viewed it with ""Use HQ Weapons"" set to OFF. Suit fixes Fixed a graphical issue that appeared when pairing the Haunted outfit with various gloves. UI Fixes Fixed an issue that caused the new suppressors to have incorrect weapon menu icons. Updated the icon for the ordnance bag in the HUD. Map fixes Hell's Island - Fixed an issue that caused several doors to have hold interactions rather than instant interactions when opening them. Safe House - Fixed an issue where the safe house door to scarface room was impossible to open. Skills DMR kits and similar weapon mods that change ammo pickups no longer result in the weapon not benefiting from in Walk-In Closet, Fully Loaded ace and the team AI Sharpeyed bonus. Fully Loaded ace throwable gain chance now increases properly Updated the Infiltrator perk deck description to match its intended functionality Audio Fixed a sound issue that occurred whenever the Aran G2 Sniper Rifle was fired. Fixed an issue where Bain and Locke would comment on any civilian being killed with the same type of voiceline, instead of skipping a few and using other unique lines. Fixed getting tased or going from bleedout into fatal (fully incapacitated) causing Bain/Locke to think your team went down more than you actually did, when commenting at the end of an assault wave.

This lets you decide how to use the deck yourself, allowing you to select what fits best for your playstyle or skillset or sure up any weakness.

218620,PAYDAY 2: Street Smart & Hostile Takeover Bundle,"Hello Heisters! Coming out of a content packed October, the end of the year is drawing near at frightening speed, yet we’ve worked hard to make sure you get at least one more piece of PAYDAY before the new year! So today, we embark on another adventure in Texas with the Street Smart Tailor Pack as we work our way up to another heist, and a new Bundle is introduced. Make sure you check out the new content if you feel like you’re staring into that wardrobe not knowing what to put on. Check out the bundle if you want to save a buck and get the next couple of DLCs in your pocket. Story Recap Gun runner Gemma McShay invited us to Texas to pull a heist on her biggest rival, and to find info on who's pulling his strings. While she combed our intel, we launched a train robbery for the ages to liberate some valuable printing plates on their way to a mint facility. Now, our journey takes an unexpected turn to an oil company's headquarters in Dallas. We've discovered who was bankrolling Midland Ranch, and a new ally wants to take her down. Time for a little corporate espionage! Street Smart Tailor Pack The term Street Smart refers not only to having the knowledge and resourcefulness to survive in an urban environment, but now also looking absolutely smashing in PAYDAY 2! This Tailor Pack contains 3 unique outfits each coming with 4 varieties in addition to 3 masks, each with 2 varieties. The Street Smart Tailor Pack is available now for $2.99 or as part of the Hostile Takeover Bundle. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/b9b5ef33dfc1b9e060f9bd12b7fbbee469c15114.png Hostile Takeover Bundle This Bundle works just like the recently finished Lost in Transit bundle did. We’ve bundled the upcoming content pieces and set them at a hefty discount up-front. First up in the bundle is the Street Smart Tailor Pack, containing 3 outfits with a total of 12 variations as well as 3 amazing masks each in two varieties. Next up is the McShay Mod Pack followed by the McShay Weapon Pack 3 after which the bundle is completed by the release of the Hostile Takeover Heist. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/b7abf1ec521c1ed196721983b294d2e6d2fd82ef.png New Accessibility Options In our last update, we included the option to change the color of flashbangs from bright white, to a more gentle black for those of you heisters who prefer a darker environment. We’ve expanded on this option a bit and you can now choose white, light gray, dark gray or black. You can even choose to remove the damage flash color effect entirely should you prefer that. We also split the option into 3, screen flash color, damage flash color and blur zone flash color. Screen flash color is flashbangs or similar effects. Damage flash color is the color at the edges of your screen when you take damage. Blur Zone flash color is the screen color effect whenever you’re in an area of worsened vision, such as near smoke or explosions. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/26a76ddb53b78efc5656fb3b8225a3596075c7ed.png Keep those helmets flying!

218620,Halloween Twitch Drop Issue,"Hello heisters. Earlier this week we were excited to share our Halloween celebration this year with all of you, via a Halloween themed stream on several platforms. One of the main features of this stream was that we offered Drops on Twitch, for ingame outfits matching the outfits of our stream stars for the evening. We’re incredibly honored to see the excitement you all showed us for our evening look. However, shortly after the festivities died down we noticed a problem; A lot of you reported that you were unable to find the Haunted outfit ingame after claiming the Drop. When we started the investigation, we quickly found an issue with the way this particular outfit was named on the Twitch campaign side, so it didn’t award correctly for most of you despite filling the conditions. We’re not able to fix this without restarting the Twitch campaign. Instead of this, we have decided to award the outfit to all players with a Starbreeze account. All you need to do to receive the outfit is to launch the game, with your account connected, before the end of the Twitch Drop campaign. We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this. We hope you now will still enjoy dressing up as our banshee, and keep watching PAYDAY 2 on Twitch to earn the remaining Twitch Drops. Keep those helmets flying!

You’ve just been good this year and we wanted to give you something special yet again. We’re releasing three new outfits that you can use to show enemies and innocent bystanders alike the true meaning of fear! … I mean, I guess gunfire and excessive violence would do that just fine… In any case, you are getting brand new outfits, a whole 3 outfits including suits, masks and gloves. And a pair of ""non-descript"" glasses. To claim these items, all you need to do is to watch a stream! Ideally ours, starting (live now!). You’ll also need a Starbreeze Account connected to Twitch and Steam. If you can't make it to our Horrifying Halloween stream, just watch any participating PAYDAY 2 streamer in the week that follows.

218620,PAYDAY 2: Lost in Transit Bundle - The Lost in Transit heist ,"Hello Heisters! Good orange month to you heisters! And a happy spring to the southern-hemisphere crooks out there. Despite getting closer to the end of the year, we’re not done yet. Coming right out of celebrating 11 years since the release of PAYDAY: The Heist, we move on from old to new with the release of the Lost in Transit heist! The Lost in Transit heist The crew has been tasked by their new Texas accomplices with getting their hands on a shipment of printing plates being transported by high-security trains. While our heisters are no strangers to train robbery while in movement, this time we’ll try to stop the trains while they’re still at the station. We hope to see you in crime.net playing the new heist! Marshal Shield While we've certainly enjoyed our time in Texas, they have not liked having us. We tread on their pride once too many and now they're bringing forth new forces against us. The Marshal Shield units have, not entirely surprisingly, shields. These high-tech shields are equipped with flashers able to blind any foe brave or foolish enough to face them. This does not come entirely without downsides though as a diligent heister can destroy the shields, revealing the soft highly shootable Marshal beneath. Even if you manage to de-shield this new threat however, don't feel safe yet - as that's when they bring out the big guns, literally. Twitch Drops Not only are you getting a new heist and new enemies, we've upped the ante with some new Twitch drops. A classic outfit to make you fit in at the train yard you're about to absolutely destroy. The drops are available to anyone that has a Starbreeze Account linked to Steam and Twitch, check it out here Accessibility Options Lastly, we’ve added options for those of you who’d like to protect your hearing in Disable Tinnitus Ringing Effect under accessibility options. Additionally now that we added more flashes to the game, you can turn those flashes dark instead of bright white also under accessibility > Screen Flash Color. This’ll help you not hit your toes on everything after a session of late-night heisting. This release continues the Texas Heat campaign and rounds off the Lost in Transit story. If you haven’t already the Lost in Transit bundle contains 4 DLC at a huge up-front discount. https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074250/PAYDAY_2_Lost_in_Transit_Bundle/ If, on the other hand, you prefer your DLCs on their own, you can pick up the Lost in Transit heist as a single. https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074240/PAYDAY_2_Lost_in_Transit_Heist/ Update size 289.2 MB Keep those helmets flying!

218620,PAYDAY 2: 11th Anniversary,"Happy 11th PAYDAY anniversary heisters! If PAYDAY was a person, it’d be able to vote, have a beer or drive… ok, maybe not any of those, but certainly old enough to take part in armed robbery! We’re thrilled to yet again have you with us as we celebrate another year of PAYDAY. While 11 years isn’t the most well celebrated anniversary, we still feel you’ve been good at being bad this year and deserve a little something. When preparing for this celebration, we asked ourselves, what or who aside from PAYDAY personifies crime? Our minds were brought back to the gangster era of 1920’s USA and all the great stories that were born there. To that end, we put together a very special outfit, two masks and a stinger reminiscent of one of the world’s most known and (beloved?) criminal masterminds, for you, our favorite crooks. To claim the items you need to have a Starbreeze Account linked to your Steam account, if you don’t already have a Starbreeze Account you can sign up here. In addition to the freebies we also got an absolutely massive changelog of various fixes and changes, you can check those out here. Lastly, we stream on most Thursdays from 17:00 CEST(GMT+1). This week we're hosting special anniversary stream playing PAYDAY: The Heist, feel free to stop by our Twitch Channel.! Keep those helmets flying! OVERKILL_Tobias",1666098016,
218620,PAYDAY 2: Update 229 Changelog,"Update 229 Changelog Update size: 593.1MB General Players in the lobby are now notified when someone picks an entry or escape plan. Changed Graze skill so that it no longer hits civilians. Fixed an issue for clients where AI were able to start shoot actions and open fire while performing certain actions like climbing, jumping, vaulting etc. Added checks for periodic fire damage to prevent crashes. Also changed it so that applying burning on an enemy that was already affected by burning, refreshes the damage per tick and duration. Fixed an issue that allowed a player, with the Berserker Aced skill, to still receive healing from third parties when the player was equipped with the Tag Team Perk Deck. Fixed several issues related to the Pocket ECM The feedback interval has been corrected to match the in-game description (1 second) If an effect is synced, but one is already running locally, the synced one will be queued, preventing latency from blocking them. Only the user that starts an effect will sync it to other players, instead of all players being able to inconsistently do so. Feedback stunning still runs stuns through the host, but clients no longer have to wait for a response, nor are they able to waste charges by using the ability twice in quick succession. Stopping of effects is not synced anymore, to prevent effects from ending earlier than intended for other players. Feedback will now work with the intended interval and do multiple stun ticks instead of only once. Feedback now uses the camera position (or synced camera position from other players), instead of the root position of the unit (around the feet). Improvements for drop-ins while the effects are on-going. Berserker states now block feedback heal-on-kill provided from other players. Frenzy healing reduction now applies to feedback heal-on-kill. Level Black Cat - Fixed a graphical issue that could be seen when looking out of certain windows. Black Cat - Fixed an invisible collision around the casino machines that would cause objects to look like they were floating. Black Cat - Fixed a graphical issue that would allow the player to see out of bounds. Fixed a random crash that could occur on every heist. Weapon Added the VD-12 stock mod as an available mod for more weapons. Fixed an issue that allowed the heatsinked suppressed barrel and the R4 Medved suppressor to be equipped on the Patchett SMG, and its Akimbo version, at the same time. Fixed an issue that allowed the player to see through the Hailstorm, when reloading, with the conversion kit applied. Fixed some text on the Hailstorm to display properly on the weapon. Characters now comment when a viper grenade is thrown. Changed so that the Tombstone slug no longer gives extended range and falloff reduces tick ratio. Increased the damage on the Basilisk 3V Grenade Launcher. VR Fixed Chromatic Aberration not working outside of VR. Fixed a VR issue where a white box would appear over the health icon, when using an active throwable from a perk deck. Updates may be incompatible with the mods you may have installed. Even seemingly unrelated mods may cause unexpected issues. If you are experiencing any issues with the game; try removing any mods you may have installed and try again. If you are having issues with an unmodded game you can try to verify the integrity of the game files. In the steam library; right click on PAYDAY 2. Select """"Properties"""" from the menu. Under the tab """"LOCAL FILES"""" select """"VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES..."""". The process may take some time to finish. Keep those helmets flying!

218620,PAYDAY 2: Lost in Transit heist delay,"Hello Heisters, We hope the autumn season is treating you well and that the skeletons in your closet have yet to find their trumpets, keeping you awake with their incessant dooting. Today’s announcement isn’t about skeletons or pumpkins though, it’s about the Lost in Transit heist being delayed. Though first planned for October 19th, we’ve made a promise to ourselves that if we feel the content needs to be delayed for the sake of quality, we’ll delay it. The level is looking good already, but we have more bugs than we’d like still roaming around the heist than we’d feel comfortable releasing with. The new release date for the Lost in Transit Heist will be the 25th of October. We hope you’ll have patience as we politely ask those pesky bugs to get lost... In transit.
