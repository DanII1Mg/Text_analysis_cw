2923300,QoL Update,"Hello Bananas! QoL Changes Today we have some changes regarding QoL (Quality Of Life) changes. That makes it easier to spot different types of bananas inside the game, search and filter them out as well. (The filter does not save between game sessions) Oh and we've updated the game to reduce the storage usage! (Unninstalling & installing is recommended!) Normal Bananas - The Huge Quantity So, we've been seeing, for a while, that the normal banana quantity is still increasing, really fast. So, we're gonna give it another purpose within the game to make it useful and clean some inventories. (BTW! There's a delete button if you think you have too many of any banana, you can delete them from your inventory!) We're changing the usage of the exchanging system to add the requirement of an X amount of normal bananas per rarity of which it's exchanging to, to simplify here's how it goes: Exchange System Update: 10 x Normal > Common - No Change 10 x Common + 2 Normal > Uncommon 10 x Uncommon + 4 Normal > Rare 10 x Rare + 8 Normal > Epic 10 x Epic + 16 Normal > Ultra Rare 10 x Ultra Rare + 32 Normal > Legendary Color Explanation: (Light Green = New) Change Notes: Added a new background (what might this mean?) Added a line to differentiate the rarities between bananas Added an icon to differentiate between the ""O""riginal, ""E""xchanged and ""S""tore/Item Store bananas Added Search Bar, to find the bananas inside your inventory Added filters, to filter out whatever you wanna filter out Added ""Total Items"" label, to tell you how many bananas in total you have Added ""Selected"" label, when you click ""Select for Stack"", to tell you how many bananas in total you have selected Added a ""Show In Market"" button on the info panel Added ""Total Items"" label, to tell you how many bananas in total you have that are eligible to exchange Updated the ""Exchange"" button, to tell you how many Normal Bananas it requires for the specific exchange Added a popup error message when a user does not have enough normal bananas to exchange - The Banana Team",1732115368,

2923300,Banana Drop Pool Update & Answering a Stacking Question,"Hello Bananas! Before we release more Autumn 2024 Collection bananas we're updating the drop chance for the bananas. Why? A: From our calculations, if we kept the same drop chances, it would increase the higher rarity bananas' number, which would decrease their actual value. The more there are the less value they have, and that's the opposite of what we want. Why only now? A: Only now we have an idea of the number of bananas that can be created and we have more statistics on what can happen. And with the exchange system, it will go down more smoothly in terms of bananas not circulating (being exchange into higher rarities). So here are the new drop chances! (Old > New) Normal - 54% > 70% Common - 30% > 25% Uncommon - 10% > 4.89% Rare - 4% > 0.1% Epic - 2% > 0.01% Ultra Rare - 1 in 4 000 000 > 1 in 400 000 Legendary - 1 in 28 000 000 > 1 in 10 000 000 What stacking question? We noticed there's been some confusion with the exchange system and exchanged bananas, so we'll try to clear it up as much as possible - sorry if it’s caused any confusion! Any banana you get from the exchange system will have the ""Origin Exchanged"" tag. Whether you use exchanged or dropped bananas, the result will always be an ""Exchanged"" banana. Pretty straightforward, right? Now, a few of you pointed out that exchanged bananas aren’t stacking with dropped bananas. We’re working on a way to visually show the difference between dropped and exchanged bananas. Here’s why that matters: Some people have spent serious cash on their dropped bananas, and now the same ones can pop up from exchanges We want to make sure that if you own a dropped banana, you can still flex your original, earned version. (There's gonna be a visual difference that will not impact how the banana itself looks, more so as a colored symbol/text in the tags section when you hover over the banana in the market that kind of ""jumps"" in your sight so you really can't miss it and also in-game and inventory there will be this slight visual indicator) - The Banana Team",1729174320,

2923300,Banana Exchange System,"Hello bananas! After hard work and some ideas thrown back and forth we've come up with the Exchange System! We have a bunch of more update to tell you about, so keep on reading! Collections We've added 4 Collections: Legacy 1 (From the start of the game until around mid may) Legacy 2 (From around mid may until mid june or july) Summer 2024 (From mid june/july until September 21st 2024) Autumn 2024 (From September 21st 2024 to ) (Autumn 2024 Collection isn't included here yet because it's not yet complete!) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44970814/84ea7930415bc722d5254cf3ad32d965a2554476.png 1 Collection lasts/is built during 3 months*. *The common bananas will be used to exchange into the current collections (right now Summer & Autumn) afterwards, only the bananas within the same collection can be used (e.g. Common into Uncommon, and Uncommon into Rares, and so on). We're looking into making the exchange system dynamic, E.g. 5 bananas from Legacy 1 + 5 bananas from Legacy 2 = 50% legacy 1 and 50% legacy 2 result. Legacy 1 & 2 were made from the first 2-3 months of bananas between them. We've tried to make them the same amount of rarities. Sounds We've added some sounds to the game, so it doesn't sound like it's just dead when you're using it: Clicking sounds Entering Menus (Inventory & Settings) Exchange System Sound (Animation) Exchange System! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44970814/8c724317cfb0287bf2abe5a8d61d276e5fd168e8.gif We've added the asked exchange system/trade up system, to be able to use lower tier bananas into higher tier bananas. Right now you'll need 10 of the lower tiered bananas to upgrade into 1 of the higher tier banana. BUT to prevent people (mainly ""oilers"") from spamming and gaining a lot of higher tiered bananas we've found a way to prevent that spam, with TOKENS! Tokens {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44970814/4aec3b5511658238dc296048d277334ef97900b2.png For every exchange ABOVE normal, so common > uncommon, uncommon > rare (and so on), you'll require 1 token per exchange. So, requirements will be 1 token + 10 bananas (common, uncommon, rare, epic, ultra rare or legendary) Everyone will get 300 tokens for free at the start!! Afterwards you'll keep getting around 8 per week OR you can buy them in the item shop! Why Tokens? We do this for two reasons: This makes it more fair for the people who recently started buying and people who will be buying new bananas to exchange as the trade & market-lock, from purchasing those, also goes over into the stacked or exchanged bananas anyway. This way EVERYONE is tied to 8 tradeups in a week and 7 days trade & market-lock after exchange, the only thing you can ""bypass"" if you so need to/want to is by buying more exchange tokens from our item store, you can look at them as some form of tiny keys. Examples: 1 token + 10 Normal bananas = 1 Common Summer 2024 or Autumn 2024 Collection Banana 1 token + 10 Uncommon bananas = 1 Rare Summer 2024 or Autumn 2024 Collection Banana 1 token + 10 Rare Bananas Legacy 1 = 1 Epic Legacy 1 Collection Banana Change Notes: Overhauls the integration system with steamworks Updates stack & unstacking system to make them more responsive & work better Adds new sounds (clicking, opening and closing menu, exchange animation) Adds new volume option to the settings Menu, also saves between gameplay sessions Removes triggering item drop on clicking, which causes some players to recieve rate limits Adds new stacking system & loading screen Adds new unstacking system & loading screen Adds number of selected bananas when selecting for stacking Adds button to refresh inventory, limited once per minute Adds token input, to show how many you have * The exchange token numbers are subject to change. - The Banana Team",1729031178,['workshop']

So, the NEWLY UPDATED DROP POOL with PERCENTAGES WOO! Removed 18 hour drop pool Updated 3 hour drop pool to the following*: 58% Normal 34% Common 8% or to be exact 7.999999714285% ~ Rare 1/4 000 000 Ultra Rare 1/28 000 000 Legendary Good luck! :wink: * Subject to change",1721130280,

Current Bugs To keep everyone up with what we're doing, we're still tweaking the memory issue at the moment, we've found a solution already, but it's still not 100% how we wanted so, you gotta wait a bit longer.

We're also moving forward with CRAFTING!/Tradeups/""Peeling the banana"" (we still haven't figured out 100% how we're gonna call it). The numbers are not set in stone 100% but we'll be updating you guys whenever it gets released. Drop Pool Changes Changing the drop pool system, nowadays we have 2 drop pools active, 1 that drops commons every 3 hours and 1 that drops rares and more than rares every 18 hours, and we want to change that and add everything to one drop pool! Adding.. cases..? But also, change the item that is dropped into a case, where you can either keep the case, open it, or just sell it! There's no necessity purchasing anything, since you'll be able to craft your own as well with the common bananas, so that the amount of bananas that are circulating can also be decreased, giving a purpose to the common bananas! We'll have a bunch of new images and sketches to explain how this system properly works rather than just text. For now that's all we have for you! Best Regards, - Sky",1720524502,

If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game"">Read more</a> ",1718836003,
