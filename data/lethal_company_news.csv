1966720,V70 - The Incubating Update,"Long time no see. The Company has a new update for all you hard workers. Patch Notes - Overhauled the radar Added a face cam which allows you to see your fellow employees on the terminal. Reworked the radar's appearance, now using 2D sprites to display rooms. Added a compass to the HUD and to the terminal; pinging your scanner makes it more visible at the bottom of the screen. Added a line on the radar which shows the path from the currently viewed player to the exit. Added contour lines to represent terrain outdoors This should bring the radar up to the visual standard of the rest of the game and make it easier to make a difference as the computer guy. - Added new furniture Fridge Sofa chair Dog house Microwave Fancy painting Electric Chair Some of these you can sit on or store scrap inside! - Added a new outdoor daytime creature, the Giant Sapsucker (which is common to Vow) - Reworked the mansion interior Added about 8 new rooms/hallways with lots of interactable objects for scrap to hide inside. Added cabinets which can spawn in the hallways. Shrunk the vertical size of many rooms/hallways in the mansion to a more accurate scale. Overhauled the logic used to generate the mansion layouts. Now the mansion should be more interesting to explore, and has more opportunities to loop back in on itself and create non-linear layouts. - Added a new log from Sigurd: ""Team Synergy"" I am planning to rework the way Sigurd's logs are found so that they will appear like rare scrap in the interiors. For now, this one is in Artifice. - Updated the Company Cruiser Reinforced materials. It can now withstand knocking into many, many trees and rocks. The Company Cruiser now passively tries to set itself upright. There is now a tiny boost when pressing down the pedal after changing gears. - Various minor bug fixes This is the first of a series of several updates in which I'll be reworking or adding rooms to each interior, as well as adding new creatures, leading up to the update that takes the game out of Early Access. I hope you enjoy the changes here! One more thing... My friend, who made music for the disco ball and boombox, has worked with Makeship and cooked up a plush of the one and only Zed Dog! As you may or may not know, it's the rarest scrap item in Lethal Company. But I increased its spawn chance just a little bit for this special occasion.

1966720,The Bag Patch - Version 64,"Hello, I'm back with another smaller update. While working on this, I started losing steam, even though I was happy with the direction things are going. So I decided to switch to another project for a while (Welcome To The Dark Place) with the hopes of finishing it soon. Rather than holding onto this update I'm releasing it now as V64 since it has a couple nice features: - The tactical belt bag can now be bought from the terminal. It holds 15 non-scrap items and can be accessed by other players while it's around your waist. Use ""INFO"" to learn more about it. - A new, rare 0.6% chance weather event can now occur on any day at a random time. - A few bug fixes",1725508777,
1966720,V62 Patch,"Here is a list of fixes and changes. boo Mineshaft - Fixed an error with inverse teleporters when the mineshaft was present - Fixed an issue where a room could overlap with the mineshaft entrance room. - Fixed an issue where a specific corner could be walked through in the caves - Fixed an issue where the Maneater would freeze if it was crushed by a spike trap as a baby. - Fixed table props not being able to spawn in the mineshaft, which could dramatically reduce its scrap count. - Fixed an incorrect placement of a navigation blocker in the caves which prevented creatures from pathing through it. - Fixed an issue where players could drop the child down the elevator shaft. You monsters - Fixed a breaker box being able to spawn floating in the air - Scaled up the railing around the elevator to make it reasonably difficult to get ontop of the elevator from below. - The main entrance doorway can now spawn in a few different locations in the manor and mineshaft. Coilheads - Slightly decreased the time coilheads need to spend moving before recharging and decreased the time they spend to recharge - Coilheads recharge timer counts down 80% slower when they are pushing on a doorway (or otherwise stuck) than when they are actually moving, even if they are not being looked at. - Coilheads eventually enter recharge mode if they are inside the elevator. Misc - Soccer balls should now collide with objects in the ship - When turrets begin shooting they are now audible to enemies that can hear - Fixed an issue where pocketing walkie talkies and spray paint in your inventory could cause other items such as jetpacks or flashlights to begin draining battery or activate when being placed. - Tried a fix for a visual bug for non-host players, where the Maneater would transform and then briefly teleport. - The Maneater can eat scrap which belongs to hoarding bugs; this would cause hoarding bugs to become enraged forever.

Fixed inconsistent damage numbers when hitting other players with weapons. Also increased the damage when hitting other players from its originally intended 10% to 20% to keep things similar to before. Fixed incorrect positioning of a breaker box in the factory and vent spawn in the manor Fixed the logic for weight so that it's not possible to have your speed increased Fixed an issue where two players could get on the terminal at the same time, which would softlock one of them.

1966720,Version 50 - The Hopping Update,"Hi, it's been a long time, but at long last I have another lethal update to bring you! I hope you'll forgive me for suggesting in a previous post here that lethal updates would be somewhat regular and predictable--that was a bit naïve of me. Sorry, I'm just not working like I have a quota, because that would be ironic. New additions include: - A new forest moon, Adamance - Reworked Dine's exterior - Two new entities outdoors, one new entity indoors - Added Easter eggs which can be thrown. - Two new suits in the rotating shop + a disco ball - You can now run down slopes faster. - A new hazard/trap indoors Changes: - The bell now makes chimes when dropped (which will alert enemies within a large radius.) - Baboon hawks now spawn in groups of two, have 4 HP instead of 6, and do less damage when stabbing the player. - Various small changes to the scrap output and spawn rates in moons, with the goal of making more moons rewarding to go to. - It's possible to bounce off walls when hitting them at a steep angle. - Slightly increased the weight of the shovel, to make each player less of a self-sufficient killing machine. - Fixed crouch-sprinting; previously, pressing the crouch button while sprinting would cause you to crouch and then uncrouch at the same time; when spamming the key, this made it possible to sprint without making noise. - Falling out of bounds no longer teleports you to the main entrance of the facility * I know this kind of change might seem antagonistic to speed-runners, etc. But these made it possible to bypass Lethal Company's design and mechanics without requiring any more skill or strategy; I guess it would also make speed runs of Lethal Company less accessible to people who don't want to (or can't) spam a button very fast on the regular. * As a side side note, I had targeted the jetpack's crazy efficiency for this same reason (safely bypassing part of the game), but I've realized it has an irreplaceable purpose as the most wacky gimmick item, so I will respect that. - Since the manor layouts are generally more spread out than the facility layouts, manors will now always generate smaller when loaded. This was mostly an issue on Titan, which had a significant chance to generate absurdly large manors. * To compensate, the size multiplier of indoor levels in Rend and Dine have been increased, which should result in them feeling the same as before. Dine now has the same size as Rend. In the next update I want to add more creatures outside and inside, and I will probably focus a little less on end-game content for a while. I also still want to add more variety to interiors.",1713035914,

1966720,Lethal Company VR mod will make gaming's worst job too immersive for comfort,"There's a <strong>Lethal Company</strong> VR mod on the way, and to the surprise of no one, it looks like a bit of a nightmare. Lethal Company is a very funny game - it's ripe with opportunities for good bits, goofs, and gafs. It is also quite a scary game, as each of the cryptids that lie in wait across the game's numerous moons somehow manage to stay surprising no matter how many times you see them. And now, thanks to modder DaXcess, you'll be able to experience all of that in VR, meaning you can experience what is probably one of the worst fictional jobs in gaming at the moment as if you're actually there. You can check out the trailer for the mod below, which yeah, certainly looks like Lethal Company in VR! It's all done in a tongue-in-cheek kind of style that fits within the overall narrative of Lethal Company. While it looks like you'll probably walk around via your headset's controller's analogue sticks, there are a few changes made to the game that make a lot of sense for a VR take. For one, a virtual keyboard has been added into the game, considering it would be a bit difficult to use your actual keyboard while your headset is on. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/lethal-company-vr-mod?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1705336970,
1966720,Steam's best 2023 sellers include a couple of surprise indie hits,"It's no secret that 2023 was a big year for games, but the top sellers on Steam for the year include a couple of surprise indie hits that managed to go toe to toe with the big boys. What do you think the best selling game on Steam was in 2023? You'll only need one guess, but I'm not even going to give you the opportunity to do so, because it's Baldur's Gate 3. Who could have seen that coming! Literally everyone. This comes from industry analyst site <a href=""https://vginsights.com/assets/reports/VGI_Global_PC_Games_Market_Report_2024.pdf"">Video Game Insights</a>, who recently shared a report on the best selling and top earning games of 2023 on Steam - and yeah, Baldur's Gate 3 was the top earner too, you also won't be surprised to hear. According to Video Game Insights, Baldur's Gate 3 earned $657 million in revenue last year, almost twice as much as the second place game Hogwarts Legacy, which apparently took in $341 million. As the report notes, though, third place went to Starfield at $235 million, ""despite being heavily cannibalised by a day one Xbox Game Pass release and underwhelming launch reception."" Other titles featured on the list won't surprise you that much, like Resident Evil 4 and EA Sports FC 24, but in ninth place is one of last year's later entries, and surprise indie hit, Lethal Company, which apparently made $52 million in revenue. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/steam-best-2023-sellers-surprise-indie-hits?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1705312675,

1966720,The Challenge Moons Patch - Version 47,"Hello employees, I hope you had a good Christmas. Now get back to work!!! I've been taking a break, catching up on movies and writing and drawing, so this update isn't too crazy but has lots of little things. In Version 50 I hope to add lots of new creatures and map variation. (However since there are big changes in my life, I might not be able to work on it as quickly as I worked on Version 45.) Edit: Sorry, I'm not as active on Steam so I forgot to mention here: Lethal Company won the Better With Friends award! Thank you, that is so cool. Version 47 Notes: - Added replayable challenge moons * These are weekly moons that use the same random seed for everyone, based off the current week using the UTC time zone. The profit you make at the end of the challenge day will be uploaded to a leaderboard so you can compare your efficiency to your friends. * The challenge moons also have randomly generated names, increased amounts of scrap, random starting credits, and other randomly tweaked properties. * The point of this is less for competition and more to give us all a shared experience. It will also give even the most seasoned employees a challenge; I have no idea what moons will be generated for the months to come, but some of them will surely be crazier than others. * If you're using a modded client, turn off all mods to guarantee you get the same moon as everyone else. - Position of random lightning strikes, the destination of the inverse teleporter, contents of gift boxes, and the precise positions of scrap items are now deterministic and based off the random seed. - Added the server tag feature for the public lobbies list. Type in a tag exactly to filter by servers that were created with that tag. - Added a new type of hallway to the factory map type. * For now I'll continue to add more rooms and variety to the current indoor map types, rather than adding new map types. Changes to existing enemies: - The thumper's movement has been reworked so its animations and acceleration should be more consistent. * The thumper speeds up slightly faster after being hit, but its turn speed drops off more reliably when it reaches high speed. - The bunker spider now becomes slightly faster when it is almost dead. - The bunker spider's webs have a slightly larger collision radius. - The forest giant is more likely to leave the ship alone after chasing a player near it. - Slightly increased the audible range of the coilhead's footsteps. - Made nutcrackers able to move slightly while aiming * They only do this if they've fired at the same person several times - Made the jester take longer to begin cranking - Added a new journal entry - Modified the bunker spider file to patch some confusing continuinity - You can now take a small amount of damage when falling from a slightly lesser height. * The height damage increases are intended to make verticality feel more important; for example I felt Titan's return trips were too simple for its level of reward. Fixes : - Fixed an issue introduced in the previous version where landmines instantly exploded when touching them, rather than waiting for players to step off. - Made shovel collisions more consistent; you can now hit enemies around corners and nearby objects without it blocking the shovel. - Fixed an issue which occurred when the masked enemy was interrupted while converting a player, which could result in the player becoming stuck or unable to move their mouse and sync position to other players * Prevented a case where the masked enemy could create dozens of duplicates of the same player if that player was somehow not allowed to die, resulting in chaos - Fixed an issue where items were incorrectly considered as being off the ship by the host if a player walked on the ship with them and didn't drop them (and vice-versa). * Spray paint should now always disappear from the moon when you enter orbit * Items from gift boxes should always stay on the ship when it moves - Prevented a case where players could take the same item out of a gift box infinite times if it somehow was not able to be despawned - Decreased the chance of gift boxes to spawn and removed Christmas decor from the item ship. The old item ship music is back. - Fixed an issue where placing the extension ladder in the cupboard and then moving it would cause the ladder's colliders to become enabled even when holding them, which resulted in erratic movement.

As you scamper around in darkened sci-fi facilities looking to meet your salvage quotas, you quickly discover why these bases were abandoned, and as always the answer is: horrifying monsters. Calamity and hilarity ensues as you watch your teammates die horribly just to bring back a coffee mug, two pickle jars, and a soda can. Another great thing about Lethal Company is that it&apos;s proving to be an extremely flexible game when it comes to modding. Despite only being out for a few months, the co-op horror adventure has lots of mods that make it possible to wear new accessories, change the rules, and add even more horrific monsters to the already terrifying game.

Of course, there are plenty of people out there with arachnophobia that simply can't play games with spiders in them, a completely understandable issue. With accessibility becoming more and more prevalent in games, it's also become broader, with some games now adding in arachnophobia modes to help those manage their fear. And Lethal Company's newly added arachnophobia mode might take the cake for the best one I've seen - at the very least it's the best one in 2023 (no I don't know if any other games released this year had one, go away). Quite simply, it just replaces the 3D model of a spider with just the word spider. No floating, very roughly spider-shaped sphere, or anything like that. It's just the word spider. Honestly, in a game that already offers plenty of funny moments, you would think it couldn't get any better, but dang did this mode get a chuckle out of me. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/lethal-company-patch-45-arachnophiba-mode"">Read more</a> ",1702228122,

Rail cheese has been nearly destroyed, but the forest giant is easier to avoid. Added to radar boosters the ""flash"" command, and the ship's new ""signal translator"" will be in great demand. Keybind settings are in, and I gave the item delivery ship a jolly spin. Gravity is more dangerous, but improved Mansion map generations will be good for us.

1966720,The Autumnal Update - Version 40,"Hello, welcome to the first update to Lethal Company. I've gotten countless good laughs watching everyone explore the game for the first time. There are a staggering amount of you, but I hope everyone can still be pleasant and make this place as cozy as it is chaotic. This update is here to fix some important bugs as well as add a little bit of new stuff. Changes: - Added Radar Boosters. Each one has a unique name and rich personality. Please take care of them. - Changes to the radar screen: * You can use the keyword ""SWITCH"" along with a player's name to view them on the terminal. This can also be used to view activated radar boosters by typing their names. - Added Baboon hawks. - Added the Inverse Teleporter. It is not recommended for a single player, as your mileage will vary drastically. - Improvements to lobbies: Added the player list in-game, including voice volume sliders, links to Steam profiles, and kick buttons for the host. Fixed an issue where if clients were unable to connect, they would just see an endless loading screen; host would then experience problems until they restarted the server. - Added giant pumpkins outdoors for the autumn season. - Added a jack-o-lantern to the ship's random shop; he is a bit late. Small changes to the zap gun: The zap gun should no longer lock onto targets behind you. The zap gun now has a slightly larger range at which it can begin locking on. - The jetpack now properly syncs the user's rotation with other players. - Hives hopefully should no longer disappear when entering orbit. - Various fixes and improvements to AI, including: Forest giants will drop a player if they are stunned while attempting to eat them. Manticoils can now be killed. Eyeless dogs can now be killed. Previously, one hit would sometimes register as two hits on Flowerman. ...And more I've forgotten! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42630547/e111a39262ae2f1d8cf8515606e6587479828671.png ",1699725596,

1966720,Lethal Company released! What now?,"Hello and welcome! It has been a long time but the game is finally out in early access. The journey here The journey here was long and winding, with the most intense and prolonged prototyping phase of any game I have worked on. To give you an idea of this, here is an example: Lethal Company started out as a completely indoor game with an elevator instead of a space ship. The development of the game was actually logged every two weeks from the very beginning, over on my Patreon. Many times throughout development I was unsure if what I was making would turn out to be a confusing, broken mess of wasted months of effort, and I even wondered if recording the whole process would somehow ruin it (as it often does). But this has been one of the most fulfilling projects I've ever worked on, requiring friends and faith and humor. I am happy you are now here to see the unfinished product! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42630547/3ed1365f4c772b23ef0049d8ef248e05528ca20a.png What now While fixing bugs here and there, I am going to focus on mainly adding new content, cycling between new creatures, items/upgrades, and decorations. I am unsure if updates to Lethal Company should happen weekly or every other week. I think it won't have a rigid schedule but a usual pace you'll come to know. I don't want the game to grow too stale from a tiny, constant drip feed of updates; I want to release updates that have a nice handful of new things to discover each time, so you can come back and be surprised. A place where you can discuss the game and find friends to play with is our Dark Place Travelers discord.",1698148528,
