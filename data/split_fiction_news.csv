The Prince - Jonatan Järpehag Split Fiction Composer Q&A To celebrate the release of the original soundtrack, we sat down with one of the game's composers, Gustaf Grefberg (AKA Lizardking), to ask some exclusive behind-the-scenes questions about how the score was produced. How did you find working on and creating music for a game like Split Fiction, which jumps between sci-fi and fantasy genres? As fun as it gets. It helps to be more than one composer, of course. We can tag in and out when things get challenging. But the truth is that during several years of production, it almost never got boring. Even within the genres, we had so much room for variation, and aiming for something unique in each chapter was so much fun. You will find that the chapters within a genre sound different too. It’s certainly harder sometimes to churn out new ideas on an almost daily basis, but it’s certainly fun too. When creating music for a particular level, what was your process for creating a track that fit the mood and tone of the level? We sat down and played through with what we had, which often meant something very much work-in-progress. We discussed the overall feeling before we spent some time (usually one to two weeks, depending on available time) to just try out ideas and moods. We then sat down with Josef and listened together and came to a final direction. Sometimes we got them down right away, other times we went through a few iterations to get the feeling and mood that we all aligned with and Josef enjoyed. When creating the OST for Split Fiction, what inspirations did you take from other games/media, if any? Since every chapter in Split Fiction is so different, we wanted to do things similarly to the visuals and the gameplay and throw the player into a new world of music. Someti...",1744376524,

In ""A Way Out"" it was “Trust” and in ""It Takes Two"" it was “Collaboration”. With Split Fiction, it’s all about “Friendship”. That is also the heart of the experience we hope you will have as you play the game. Whether it is strengthening your bond with a partner or immersing yourself in the journey with an old friend. We created Split Fiction by putting passion, creativity and a big love of video games first. This is a game that was built collaboratively by everyone at Hazelight and we haven’t shied away from putting not only our best but also wildest ideas into it. We hope you will enjoy playing our game as much as we did making it. We are so eager to let you and other players around the world finally dive into our latest co-op adventure. To say that we’re proud of it is an understatement! We also hope you will make those lasting memories in Split Fiction that only come from sharing an experience with someone else - that’s what it’s all about in the end. Enjoy, Hazelight Studios Welcome to Split Fiction Grab your co-op buddy and get ready to go on an out-of-this-world sci-fi and fantasy adventure in Hazelight Studios’ latest game, Split Fiction – available now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Verified on Steam Deck. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/6cd78d501c58ab08ec771ec54fefb68ed53eb4e0.png Experience mind-blowing moments as you’re pulled into the many worlds of Split Fiction, a boundary-pushing, action-packed cooperative journey from the studio behind 2021 Game of the Year winner, It Takes Two. One minute you’re raising adorable dragons and the next you’re fleeing the law on futuristic motorcycles, outrunning terrifying trolls, or evading hover cars thrown by a robotic parking attendant. It’s weird, it’s wild, and it’s designed to be shared. Mio and Zoe are contrasting writers – the former writes sci-fi while the latter writes fantasy – who become trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. They’ll have to rely on each other to break free, working together to master a variety of abilities and overcome diverse co-op challenges while jumping between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in this tale of unexpected friendship. The Power of Friendship Split Fiction is a unique split-screen or online experience specifically designed for two-player cooperative play. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/9f82de86cdeb333d1fff43876643e8e19b026f07.png You and a friend will be able to easily team up as Mio and Zoe with just one copy of the game by utilizing Hazelight’s signature feature: the Friend’s Pass*, which now can be used with cross play. This lets your co-op buddy play for free regardless of what platform they’re playing on.

2001120,Split Fiction (PS5) Review,"Hazelight Studios has made quite the name for themselves, particularly when it comes to storytelling adventures and cooperative play. When <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222700/A_Way_Out/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hazelight’s <em>A Way Out</em> released in 2018</a>, it really put a focus on sharing an adventure together with friends. The team made sure it was not only split-screen, but if you wanted to play with someone and they didn’t own the game, they could have a Friend’s Pass to play along with you without needing to purchase the game. It was unheard of, and still is really, that a game company wouldn’t make each player buy a copy. Beyond that, the game itself was great, and since its release, the studio has only doubled and tripled down on their cooperative, fun-first experimental focus, and it has more than proven itself as a powerhouse of a studio.

2001120,What is the Friend's Pass?,"The Friend's Pass The Friend's Pass*, a staple feature from Hazelight Studios, returns once again in Split Fiction! As Split Fiction is a true co-op adventure you experience alongside a partner, Hazelight wants to make the process of finding someone to be the Mio to your Zoe as simple as possible. The Friend's Pass allows anyone who owns the game to invite a friend to join the fun online for free, even if they don't own a copy! Better still, the Friend's Pass lets you connect and play with friends across different platforms with crossplay for the very first time in a Hazelight game. And you can do this as many times as you like, even if you invite a new friend to play through the sci-fi and fantasy adventure each time! How Friend's Pass Works Getting someone to play with you can be done with these four simple steps: Step 1. I own Split Fiction Step 2. Friend installs Friend's Pass on their chosen platform Step 3. I send an invite to my friend, who then accepts the in-game invite Step 4. Play The Entire Game Together {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/146aed56bf5e850c7110fca7a0407e0168403ae7.png Friends Pass Trial Even if neither you and your co-op partner own a copy of Split Fiction, you can both experience a Trial of the game for free using the Friend's Pass! Once you both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, you will be able to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together, and then continue your progress if one of you purchases a full copy of Split Fiction! Cross-Play No matter what platform you and your friends are playing on, you will be able to team up and experience Zoe and Mio's story through Split Fiction. Connect between PC and PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S all combinations are possible! Playing Split Fiction via cross-play will require a free EA Account, so be sure to sign up. If no one on your friends list is available to play Split Fiction with you, you can also use the ""Looking for Player"" channels on the Hazelight Discord server to arrange game sessions with other players in the community, letting you both journey through the incredible sci-fi and fantasy worlds Mio and Zoe have to escape from! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/d01ccf371bca9d155e91ae92cd1cb7e2369cb160.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/d1d7577c73ae0135760c794a8fdca24d3d22ba41.gif If all that has got you excited to learn more about Split Fiction, make sure to follow Hazelight on both X and Instagram to see more aspects of the game showcased ahead of launch.

2001120,Who are Mio and Zoe?,"If you've played a Hazelight Studios game before, you know that the characters they create for you and your co-op partner come with unique personalities, backgrounds, and motivations that produce unforgettable moments as their stories unfold. In A Way Out, you take control of Leo Caruso and Vincent Moretti, an unlikely duo who team up to escape from prison. Meanwhile in It Takes Two, you play as married couple May and Cody Goodwin, trying to save them from a seemingly inevitable divorce. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/f437ca5a30cb1a67a6c30c31e45f4954a489ae32.jpg Hazelight Studios are keeping that trend up as they introduce two brand new player characters in Split Fiction. You will take control of two unpublished authors, Mio and Zoe, who you will quickly find are worlds apart! When you first meet Mio and Zoe, they have been lured into Rader Publishing Headquarters with the promise of a potential publishing deal which goes horribly wrong, trapping them inside a simulation of their stories which you have to help them escape. In this blog, we're going to dive deeper into their characters so that you can confidently pick your favourite when you get your hands on the game! Mio Hudson - Science Fiction Author Reserved. Decisive. Realist. Introvert. Raised in the city with her father, Mio has barely scraped by for the last couple of years. She isn't looking for fame or recognition as an author, she's just in it for the money. Her love for all things sci-fi is reflected in her literary works, taking place in neon lit cyberpunk cities, harsh futuristic weapon plants and even in the coldness of outer space. Expect to see her love for sci-fi shine through in the abilities she gains inside the simulations, where she may become a gravity defying ninja equipped with a lethally sharp energy sword, wear an advanced exosuit that grants remote control of drones, or dual-wield laser blasters in futuristic combat armour. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/7e304a39ac4d4175ad846918660fee89f183630f.jpg Zoe Foster - Fantasy Author Charismatic. Empathetic. Optimist. Extrovert. A cheerful country girl with a deep need to prove to her family that she's not a complete failure. Zoe hopes that a publishing deal will solve all of her problems. Fantasy is her favoured genre, with her portfolio containing works of fiction about escaping towns overrun by trolls, battling through forests against an impending ice age, and protecting the last dragons from extinction. Given her love for the fantastical, you can look forward to seeing Zoe as a magical shapeshifter flying across the lands as a fairy, wield a mythical sword whilst riding a dragon into a battle of the ages, or soar between floating islands with a magical kite. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/20983f245e5dd712d6dcd036d2a613798cfe3e47.jpg As our characters are clearly such polar opposite personalities, they will have to come to terms with their differences, uncover hidden secrets about themselves, and realise that in order to escape the simulations they find themselves trapped in, they will have to work together and overcome the odds through the power of friendship. During the game announcement at The Game Awards in December, Josef Fares revealed that the characters' names mean a great deal to him, as Mio and Zoe are in fact named after his daughters! Now for the tricky question for you and your co-op partner: who is going to play as Mio and who will play as Zoeâ€¦? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/65fd8f7b5bf11e869d2a5dda2585c235ab59b400.jpg The Friends Pass Like A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios' staple feature, The Friend's Pass*, returns again, allowing one player that owns the game to invite a friend to play online for FREE!

2001120,Split Fiction - An Introduction to Side Stories,"The Story So Far You and your co-op partner play together as Mio & Zoe, two writers stuck in a simulation of their own stories while visiting the shady new Rader Publishing headquarters in pursuit of a lucrative publishing deal. An accident puts Mio and Zoe inside the same shared simulation, throwing them back and forth between their own sci-fi and fantasy fiction while the nefarious publishing company tries to steal all of their ideas. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/a47c9d760b73dd3fe25bd82bf52ee32272b04c6e.jpg What Are Side Stories? If you’ve played A Way Out or It Takes Two before, you’ll know that Hazelight Studios are masters of co-op gameplay variety. In addition to all of the incredible sci-fi and fantasy variety featured in the Split Fiction main story, you will encounter mysterious, out of place portals that you can enter to explore all new and vastly different worlds and locations that are completely optional. These are Side Stories! Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/bd11b9c831da0216566c26176deddafa91e38df1.jpg Without wanting to spoil them all, you can look forward to experiencing Side Stories featuring a daring mountain climb filled with Giants, riding Sandfish across a desert and snowboarding while performing killer tricks down a mountain - under heavy fire. Other Side Stories will have you become pigs and finding out exactly how sausages are made, chasing enemies while water-skiing and exploring the depths of space on a spacewalk gone wrong – these are just a few examples of Mio and Zoe’s imagined Side Story scenarios, which they now have to live out (and escape from) all the while adding even more crazy and chaotic gameplay variety on your adventure through Split Fiction. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45343552/7c21ed9994b70749d349f61e47c88bf7d33c5a12.jpg As these stories have been deeply influenced by our authors' pasts, they will experience long since forgotten ideas and secrets about themselves. Once a Side Story has been completed, our characters return back through the portal to the main level where they first entered the encounter, filled with even greater determination to escape from Rader’s machine with their memories and stories intact… so, going back to our original question, are you up to the challenge? Fun Fact - Hazelight Studios host internal Game Jams in their studio alongside regular game development where they all work together to come up with all kinds of crazy new gameplay mechanics and unexpected story moments. Hazelight then takes the best ideas and creations and adds them into their games ready to give you never before seen co-op experiences and mind blowing moments. This is how Side Stories are brought to life for you to experience at launch!
