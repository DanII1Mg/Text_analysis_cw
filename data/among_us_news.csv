WE SURVIVED THE IMPOSTORS FOR ANOTHER YEAR!!!Thank you for a ✨stellar 2025✨ full of fun updates, multiple vent cleaning claims, and you-definitely-not-asking-us-about-the-TV-show-and-where-it-is. (It is NOT cancelled??? Why do I keep seeing people claim this please lmao.)I wanted to do a silly recap of what we’ve accomplished together this year, but FIRST let’s get through some housekeeping.New Years Eve 2026 DropOur yearly tradition is coming! Get a special, limited time NYE 2026 Hat for FREE when you log in starting December 26, 07:00 UTC. Ring in 2026 with your Crewmates and ensure you can be the person in future lobbies going “Oh this hat? It was limited edition. You just had to be there.” Ahhh, FOMO. This giveaway ends on January 31, 2026 so don’t forget about it!Until then, the Snowflake, Snowbean, and Gift Cosmicubes are BACK!

During that time expect less posts on social media (unless I get bored waiting in line for something and start replying to stuff on my phone lol) and no updates during this time. (Victoria not using parentheses while writing a devlog challenge: IMPOSSIBLE.)If you encounter any bugs or issues with the game during this time, our player support team will still be helping out! You can email them here or check out the helpdesk.2025 RecapNow let’s take a walk down memory lane and see all the horrors tasks we’ve completed this year. Fun fact: this year, everyone on the Innersloth team are confirmed Crewmates. We think. We’re still not really sure about Gary.First, let’s reflect on the 2025 Roadmap we released:Improved MatchmakingUpdate v16.0.0 back in March brought an important change to Among Us – a new way to create and find lobbies! We got solid feedback from you on what you needed to find your perfect match (thanks to everyone who filled out the Player Feedback form near the beginning of the year), so we added filters, the ability to view settings before you join a game, and more.I am still obsessed with the way Crewmates fill up the maps on the Create Game screen by the way. The details of what they’re doing… *chef’s kiss*New RolesIn September, we released two new roles in v17.0.0: Detective and Viper!The Detective was our first Crewmate role that needed much more involvement and big brain IQ to properly strategize with. (Confession: I am terrible at this role. My brain is too small.)Meanwhile, the Viper got a cool custom kill animation and got to wreak havoc in lobbies. Shout out to this one comment I saw that said “I got puked on by Viper, the animation is grosssss 😂”. Please consider it an honor to be puked on by Viper.CollabsThe most recent (and ongoing) collab was with the ConcernedApe himself for a Stardew Valley Cosmicube! This all started when we bullied him into going to the aquarium with us in Seattle back in 2023. (I’m joking.) (But we did go to the aquarium!) Don’t forget to pick it up for a mere 3300 Beans before it ends in February 2026.Our big collab this year was with RGG Studios to bring the Kamurocho gang to the game in an official Cosmicube. Please tell me you saw the karaoke video we made for it. Please. And if you already saw it, watch it again.But that wasn’t all! To celebrate their Version Luna I launch, we’ve teamed up with Genshin Impact to bring a Paimon look to Among Us. The Impostors definitely used it as Emergency Food.And back by popular demand was the Pusheen Cosmicube! Who knew something so cute could be so evil. You all truly have yelled at us SO MUCH to bring it back, and I have definitely seen a significant increase in Pusheens running around these lobbies, knocking over juice boxes.If you had a keen eye (visor?) you also likely saw our Crewmates (Impostors?) popping up in quite a few other games too! Not only was the Among Us Backbling back in Fortnite, but you could see Crewmates invading What The Car?, Unrailed 2, Tavern Talk, Spirit City: Lo Fi Sessions, and Snake.io.CosmeticsWe released a whole Racing Cosmicube in June! BEAN FOR SPEED. The team was making Fast & Furious jokes the entire month. (It’s not a Fast & Furious collaboration at all but it was too funny making “family” jokes.)Security StuffWe had depreciated 2022 and 2023 versions of Among Us to ensure everyone was on similar versions and got all the improved features, bug updates, and improved security measures.Your safety is of utmost importance to us here! ❤ Trust that even if you don’t always hear it, we’re keeping an eye on trouble and doing our best to navigate legal matters, technical requirements, crossplatform measures, and implement safety features to make your time on Among Us as smooth as possible.

945360,Behind the Beans: Tracker & Noisemaker,"Hello, Crewmates!Once again, it’s time to go BEHIND THE BEANS! We hope you’ve enjoyed the last blogs we did for our newest roles: the Detective and Viper.As a treat Dave has turned back the clock to take us through the process for some of our other roles – the Tracker and Noisemaker!Take it away, Dave!After releasing The Fungle in 2023, the next goal was to release a batch of new roles. Players had been asking for new roles for a while, so it was exciting to start prototyping different ones. Roles are a great way to create new mechanics, make the gameplay feel fresh, and add new twists to the social deduction component in Among Us.This exploration resulted in 3 new roles being released in 2024: Tracker, Noisemaker, and Phantom. I felt that the Tracker and the Noisemaker were interesting because despite both being Crewmate roles, they’re design opposites. This allowed them to have stronger, unique identities while also serving two different playstyles.NoisemakerThe Noisemaker has a very straightforward ability: when they’re killed by the Impostor, they send out an alert to the other Crewmates, guiding them to their location. It’s a pretty simple role to play because it’s passive. It automatically triggers on death. It’s a great role for players who don’t want to have another thing to do during a match. Some people just want to focus on tasks and fixing sabotages — and that’s totally okay. Honestly, that’s me a lot of the time. Of course, there was concern about the Noisemaker being too simple. This was feedback the team got frequently: it could be a letdown to get assigned a role and not have an extra ability you can use at the press of a button. But, simplicity is the name of the Noisemaker’s game. It’s not to say there isn’t any nuance to the role. A clever Noisemaker can lure the suspected Impostor to kill them in a spot that gives them away. I’ve been tricked like this a few times myself while I’ve been Impostor.The simplicity of the role doesn’t mean it’s a weak role either. It’s actually quite powerful in that the alert is a game-wide effect. It can be the deciding factor that throws off an Impostor and gets the Crewmates the win! Releasing a low complexity role was the design intent behind the Noisemaker, so I decided to keep them straightforward and simple.After it was released, seeing the Noisemaker so positively received really warmed my heart. From casual players to streamers, everyone understood the role and valued how game-changing the Noisemaker’s ability can be. One my favorite comments to this day is still:TrackerLike I mentioned earlier, the Tracker is the mechanical opposite of the Noisemaker. The Tracker has the ability to place a tracking device on another Crewmate. By opening their map, they can then see where the other Crewmate is while they move around. They were designed for the super Crewmates who, on top of doing their tasks and fixing sabotages, are constantly figuring out who’s safe and who’s suspicious.Of course, this ability is powerful. For new players, the ability was designed to be straightforward to use and understand. But as players start to get better with the role, it gives gameplay depth and surprise.On a surface level, the ability allows the Tracker to confirm another Crewmate’s location. The ability becomes more valuable once you start combining it with other information people share in Emergency Meetings. Very clever Trackers even use the ability to catch a venting Impostor, a disguised Shapeshifter, or an invisible Phantom! It was really great to see the Tracker being highly praised and valued as well. There was a lot of depth added to the design of the Tracker and players were quick to find it and appreciate it. LearningsFrom these two roles, I was able to confirm a couple of important ideas:Players appreciate roles with low skill floors. The Noisemaker’s skill floor is very low and it was well received. Therefore, it wouldn’t be farfetched to release other roles around this skill level.Players also appreciate roles with high skill floors. I was concerned that the Tracker was overdesigned or overcomplicated, so it was nice to see that players were able to fully grasp the role and all its nuances.The release of roles in 2024 was so amazing. The outpour of excitement from the players was really motivating for the team, who worked so hard on it for so many months. We’re using this positivity to continue creating more and more great stuff. This means I’ll probably be back for some more blogs, so keep a lookout for the next Behind the Beans!Off to make more noise,Dave",1759510847,
945360,Behind the Beans: Viper,"Howdy, Impostors!It’s time for another session of Behind the Beans with our principal game designer, Dave. If you missed the last deep dive, you can read it here! This time, he’s here to talk about our newest Impostor role: the Viper. This venomous role has increased the levels of chaos and added lots of spitting (ewww) to lobbies.Remember to say it, not spray it.DorsViperThe Viper is a simple role to understand. This was important to keep in mind when designing and iterating on the role. But don’t be fooled – there’s actually a lot of depth! Where and how you choose to kill now requires more thought. “How can I give the body more time to dissolve?” and “What are the entry and exit points of the location?” are just two questions to consider. The more discrete the location, the higher the chances of the body fully dissolving without a trace.Exhibit A, the Viper’s Acid ability in all its gloryA good Viper also uses their sabotages to the fullest. Need to give a dissolving body more time to disappear? Lock it behind a Door Sabotage. Need everyone to move as far away from that kill you did in Navigation? Trigger the Reactor Meltdown. A clever Viper that uses their full toolset can get away with multiple kills without ever raising a hint of suspicion.  Prototyping PhaseDuring the initial prototyping phase, it was just the design and programming teams working on it. To create a placeholder dissolved body, I took the existing art asset and erased it using dynamic jittering to get the intended look.Exhibit B, the prototype version of a dissolving bodyThe Viper had an instant impact in our games! If a dissolved body was found, the discussions were a lot more engaging around the state of the body and who was around it. On the other hand, games were very scary when Crewmates were dropping like flies but bodies were never being found.The Viper checked off a lot of boxes for a good role:It promoted more discussion in meetingsIt allowed the Impostor to strategize their kills in new waysThere is push and pull between the Viper and CrewmatesThus, the Viper was good to move on to the next stage of development!The Post Prototype ProcessThe next steps were to work with the art team to figure out the theming of the role. Since the dissolving body was so core to the Viper, figuring out the theme revolved around that. Here are some of the concepts from our brainstorming session that the art team explored:Exhibit C, a body dissolving through interdimensional meansExhibit D, the Impostor spewing a horde of tiny ImpostorsExhibit E, commanding an army of ants to kill a CrewmateExhibit F, on the left: killing a Crewmate through dehydration and on the right: killing a Crewmate by creating a black hole where they standBeyond this, there were a ton of other interesting and wide-reaching ideas, but ultimately none of them stuck as much as the dissolving acid. The Viper is a great theme and the dissolving acid is a fun visual to work with.Testing a Color Matching OptionOne final idea we explored with the dissolving body is the color scheming. By having the acid match the color of the victim, it was a gruesome visual of a melting Crewmate.Exhibit G, testing a version of the Acid where it matches the color of the killed CrewmateAs fun as this was, we ultimately went back to having just one acid color. The Viper having a specific color for their acid made for a stronger identity with the role, and it gave us time to do more fun things like creating the Viper’s kill animation!FinaleThe Viper was a great role to work on. Since it was so fun right off the bat, it gave us more time to explore the art. I hope you enjoyed this sneak peek on some of the exploration we did with the acid! Seeing all the cursed ideas from the artists was hilarious, so I figured you’d all like to see this too.And behold, the final Acid:Another Q&ABefore you run back to spit on other Crewmates, take a look at the Q&A video we did to answer questions about the Viper, featuring Daniil!Avoiding Acid like always,Dave",1758646747,
945360,Behind the Beans: Detective,"Hello, Crewmates!Welcome to a special blog post I’m calling “Behind the Beans.” We wanted to give you a peek behind the scenes (or beans in this case), and talk about some of the design decisions that make Among Us what it is currently!Thankfully, we have our amazing principal game designer, Dave, to walk us through how the team took on some new challenges in developing our newest roles: the Detective and Viper!I hope you have your magnifying glasses polished and a fresh notebook: today, Dave will showcase what it took to bring the Detective role from a cool concept into a bean-ality.Take it away, Dave!DorsDetectiveWhen I think about a detective, I picture someone who gathers clues, puts evidence together, and solves crimes. This is exactly what the Detective Crewmate does! With the Notes and Interrogate abilities, they can write down important info, gather clues from other Crewmates, and put it all together to solve murders.The Detective is one of the most complex roles the team has ever worked on. A big part of its complexity comes from the Notes ability. It’s a core component for the Detective that holds a lot of important information and can be the deciding factor on whether the Crewmates win or lose.Considering all of this, it should be no surprise that the Notes ability underwent many, many iterations. So for this blog post, I want to take you through a few of the iterations and highlight why changes were made and some of the difficulties we encountered – one issue was so scary we almost delayed the role entirely!The Early DaysThe early version of a role is always very barebones: grey blocking, reusing assets, and doing the absolute minimum to get the point of the role across. For the role prototypes, the goal is to “find the fun” as fast as possible. This means hacking together the required parts of a role so that we can playtest it ASAP.Exhibit A, the Notes for the DetectiveOne of the first versions of the Detective had a Suspect List which was created if you found the body and used the Inspect ability on it. Of course, if someone else were to walk in at this moment, they will see you standing over the body and can only assume one thing…With the Suspect List, the Detective automatically got a list of other players, one of which is guaranteed to be the killer. Through playtesting, we found out pretty quickly that there were a couple of pain points with this version:First, the role completely relied on finding a dead body. It’s pretty common to go a whole game never finding a dead body. If a player was a Detective and never found one, they never got to use their ability. This was a huge bummer!The second issue was that the Suspect List was too powerful because the killer was guaranteed to be in it. Through discussion, the list would be quickly narrowed down and the Impostor outed. We tried a variation where the number of suspects in the list was dependent on the number of players left in the match but that got way too complicated way too quickly.With these two major issues, it was important to make some changes and try a new version of the role.More Player AgencyFor the next iteration of the Detective, I wanted to give the player more agency through information collecting. True to the fantasy of being a Detective, they should be able to gather clues around the map.To alleviate the dependence on a Detective finding a body, we created “crime scenes” that replaced a dead body after the next Emergency Meeting. So, if Lime is the Detective, but Pink found the body, Pink will say that it was in Electrical and Lime can go there after the meeting to see the crime scene. The Detective will be able to Inspect the crime scene to get the Suspect List for that murder.Exhibit B, we tested crime scenes for Detectives to investigate.Speaking of the Suspect List – that also got a big change this iteration. Instead of giving the Detective a list of actual Crewmates, they have to build their own list based on information brought up in meetings. The Detective could build their own Suspect List by investigating other Crewmates around the map to learn their location at the time of the murder.Exhibit C, the second iteration for the Suspect ListPlaytests for this version went a lot better! The Detective’s ability was actually being used and crimes were being solved. Matches were more evenly balanced now that Impostors weren’t guaranteed to be on a Suspect List. But with this iteration, a new (and big) issue emerged. The Inspect ability got overloaded with how much it could do. It made it difficult to teach and play the role. Running around to inspect crime scenes and inspect other Crewmates was far too much for one role.This wasn’t an issue that could be easily solved with a minor adjustment. A big change was needed that still maintained the fantasy of playing a detective but in a way that didn’t overcomplicate the role. On to the next iteration!Almost ThereThe first step towards simplifying the role was in the crime scenes....",1758042549,

945360,New roles are on the scene of 17.0.0 | Emergency Meeting #41,"It's new content time, Crewmates!! Can you believe it?! Our new roles are finally here, and they're sure to shake up your next Emergency Meeting! Update your game to 17.0.0 so you can enjoy these new flavors of chaos and all the fixes. New Crewmate Role: Detective Some of you are proper gumshoes, and now you can live up to the name by playing as the new Detective role! This is our first role with two separate abilities. Here's how to use them: Notes: Keep track of a dead Crewmate's location, your list of suspects, and what kind of Impostor you're looking for.Interrogate: Start questioning your fellow Crewmates, and find out where they were during the crime!You can only use the ability on one active case at a time! You'll need to switch the file if you're researching multiple murders.You can change how many Interrogations a Detective can do via the advanced role settings when you're in the Dropship.When we made this role, we really wanted to make Emergency Meeting discussions even more fun!  Be careful, though! As you start putting the pieces together, you might be the Impostor's next target. Make sure to grab a fresh notebook and your magnifying glass — you're gonna need 'em! New Impostor Role: Viper This new Impostor role is perfect for destroying, or in this case, dissolving their victims. Use a well-timed Sabotage to keep the rest of the crew busy while you use your Acid ability and watch the Crewmate's body slowly melt away. Here's how it works:After a kill, the Crewmate corpse will decay in 3 stages: slightly dissolved, very dissolved, and then just a bone before it's completely gone.You can adjust how quickly the corpse dissolves in the advanced role settings in the Dropship.  Before long, the body is gone, and all you have to worry about is your alibi. Time it right and you might achieve the ultimate Impostor dream: killing without leaving any trace of it behind. No one's going to call an Emergency Meeting when there's nothing, right? If you find yourself on the unfortunate end of the Viper's acidic spit, sadly... this is your end. But at least you'll be treated to a brand new kill animation before you watch your body start to sizzle. We had a great time testing these roles and are excited to see how y'all handle these new abilities — whether you become The Skeld's greatest detective or you just want to go around spitting at other Crewmates (a lil gross, ngl), it's sure to be a ton of fun.  Alongside the new roles, we have some quality of life updates! First up is our ""How to Play"" guide. The guide was getting a little cramped with our last additions. Now that we've got 9 roles, the guide has been updated so you can more easily select which one you'd like to learn to play.  The Role Settings have also been updated! We couldn't squeeze all the new roles into the same space, so we changed the selection into a scrollable list. The roles will be ordered left to right, starting with the older roles on the left and the newer roles to the right.  Practice mode got a little lift as well! Now, when you're looking to change your role during Practice, you can choose either the new blue Crewmate folder or the red Impostor folder to find and select the role you'd like to try.  Keep reading for a few fixes we have with this update too.Patch Notes \ \ \ - You now have to enter the whole code for the Enter ID Code task. No more easy codes.When another player has your preferred Crewmate color, you will see your currently assigned color when looking in your inventory.The ""Up All Night Raving"" hats are now sorted correctly in the wardrobe.You can no longer identify dead Crewmates by viewing them in the ""Crewmates"" window during a match. If you happen to spy any strange bugs or glitches in your pursuit of the Impostors, remember to send us a ticket at our helpdesk. I'm going to pass it over to Mike to cover some known bugs with this release! New roles? New buttons? MENUS?! You know what that means... Bugs. Here's a list of some we already know about: \ - Controller button prompts do not appear when opening the Detective Notes with mouse or touch controls then switching to controller\ \ - Location map markers do not scale when changing resolution\\\ - Users rarely receive a black screen when loading into Fungle on Practice\ \ - Detective Notes window can be opened behind the ejection screen if the Role Ability key bind is pressed rapidly during an Emergency Meeting\ - Upper and Lower Decontamination are causing a minor overlap in the Location Note field\ - Changing the Killer Note does not play the Pencil SFX\ - Memory Leak takes place when switching between the 'Killed Player' tabs\ \ - Changing resolution results in the Interrogate button disappearing\ \ - Several room names are not displayed when selecting a murder location on the Map\ - Missing visual indications for tabs navigation when using keyboard/mouse or Mobile input in the lobby under certain conditions\ \ - Clients on mobile platforms can report an already d...",1757437843,

945360,May Update: A Smol Treat,"Hiya, Crewmates! Make sure you're on version 16.0.5 so you're good to go! Let's take a look at what it covers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/d6c6faa405a581cc9377f15a10c9601c9a9e2ea9.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/1b6dc35a4ce6b31cb8cd623a414306954ad57892.png If everything goes according to plan (fingers crossed for no sabotages), you won't notice any big changes. This is because the update focused on changes to the backend, which helps us keep development moving forward. This includes improvements for how we tackle hacks, exploits, and bugs. Patch Notes Here are some of the changes you can see in this update: - Impostors and Shapeshifters can't kill through sabotaged doors anymore (you're safe for now, Crewmates!) Hack fixes - We deployed anti-hacks and are keeping our visors peeled for any new sabotages. Big thank you to everyone who reported the issues, and to the hard work of the programming team. Updates to the Kamurocho Cosmicube - We updated some Kamurocho cosmetic names along with a minor store image change (can you spot the difference?) If you come across any new issues, remember to send us a helpdesk ticket! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/ac6426ec0548252afae71ba15a0a3f10390b3db9.png Welcome to the part of the devlog where we talk about the bugs and glitches that have creepily crawled into the game. Here's what you may run into while you're prepping your alibi: Known Bugs Switching from windowed to fullscreen may break the UI. In rare cases, accepting a game invite will cause a disconnect with the Among Us servers. It is difficult to see currently highlighted buttons on the Find Game screen while using a controller. Exiting Practice Mode returns players to the Main Menu instead of the Online Menu. In rare instances, buttons can't be selected while in the Dropship. Players may remain on the Find Game screen when trying to join a lobby after a network disconnect. - Win stats are not updating as intended. The team is working hard to eject these bugs, so hang tight! If you encounter any bugs or glitches, send us a ticket via our helpdesk! Remember to be as descriptive as possible so we can hone in on a solution and get you back to your tasks. Before you enter the Dropship, let's take a moment to talk about one of the more recent bugs that's had an impact on Among Us. Disconnects and Temporary Bans {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/f54fbdae6a0209a36a6a347f2097722f2b66e8bd.png When we released 16.0.0, we saw more black screen errors reported by players when trying to start a round. This would crash the game and give out an incorrect temporary ban (like in the screenshot above), which made for an understandably frustrating experience. Let's break down how the temporary bans work: Temp bans exist to discourage players from disrupting the game flow. This can be for things like: repeatedly leaving games before they're over, or leaving right after role reveals because you didn't get the Impostor role. Leaving one game before it's over shouldn't result in an immediate temp ban. Leaving multiple games before they conclude will start to count against you and potentially get you a temp ban. Before the 16.0.0 update, you could completely close Among Us, and that would clear a temp ban. Now, this isn't possible. With the last hotfix (16.0.2), we tweaked how you could get a temp ban. Now, if you disconnect from the game before roles are revealed, that won't count against you. Now, you should see far fewer instances of getting a false temp ban (AKA super long timeout) because of a black screen or game crash. That was a lot of info! Hopefully, this helps clarify what's been happening. Before we go, let's dive into the Fun Zone! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/e5b8d6f1bc7b554860da0867fa83d9fe2f39d462.png One of my favorite parts about writing these blog posts is sharing the creations y'all come up with.

Your thoughts have had a big influence on the kind of chaos we bring in updates like this. Thanks for helping shape Among Us. Finding Games At the core of matchmaking, we want to make sure you have the right tools to find the lobby you want. With that in mind, our team put their heads together and cooked up this new interface: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/bd5215346ccf2e99409646c984f214fd9379f038.png Doesn't that look snazzy? The screen delivers key info at a glance like: the amount of lobbies currently online in your server region, the map, and how many Crewmates there are. We added the player speed and if roles are activated too. With all these visible right away, you can quickly choose a lobby if you're trying to jump into a round. We've heard your cries for improved filtering! Now you can fine tune your searches via the ""Filters"" button. When you do, you'll see this new screen: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/d83e5f054cbf50cdb6d613e1388c6a7d0ff9b28b.png In the ""Filters"" screen you can choose the settings you'd like to home in on for your preferred lobby. Choices include: Classic Hide n Seek Maps Number of Impostors Roles Player Speed Kill cooldown Voting time Visual tasks Anonymous votes Confirm ejects Tags (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) After you select your settings and close the tab, you'll see how many lobbies match your choices and be able to join. If you can't find any games with the settings you chose, either unselect some or choose the ""clear filters"" option to wipe all the filters at once and start over! This just means you've gotten too specific. When you find a lobby you're ready to join, you can either tap the listing to dive right in or click ""More"" and see the game details: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/0f9c44bca40d7c23e0daded0331b02bdbeacc4e0.png If the lobby settings look good to you, it's time to join and investigate some Impostors (or at least carry your fellow Crewmates). Lobby Creation For those Crewmates who like holding the reins and creating lobbies - your experience has been upgraded too.

If all looks in order, you can click ""Join Game"" and enter the lobby. And don't worry if your chat type or region don't match - the game will update this for you (as long as you have permissions to use Free Chat) so you can focus on the upcoming chaos! Wooooo - that was a lot of info. If you find it a bit confusing, check out our handy tutorial. We hope these changes make it WAY easier for you to find that perfect lobby and be the impressive Impostors you really are.

The third number in the series (yellow box) will increase if we deploy hotfixes or have platform specific changes.

We already celebrated Innersloth's 10th birthday and the return of the Lunar New Year Cosmicube, so now let's see what other plans we have for you in 2025. BUT FIRST - AN IMPORTANT NOTE. NOTE: Please update your games! In early March, any 2022 versions of Among Us will be depreciated (removed) - if your game starts with ""v2022"" at all, you will be affected. Prepare yourselves and update now for the most seamless transition. The latest version is v2024.11.26. As Among Us grows, we need to ensure everyone is on similar versions for security and feature development reasons. We'll post again with information when it officially happens - thanks for your understanding!

With more and more roles, we realized matchmaking needed a makeover so it'd be easier to find the specific settings you like to play with. Wish you knew what the player speed was going to be before joining? If Anonymous Votes are on or off? Us too, and that's something we're aiming to get you that within the next month. Also, when accepting room codes, you'll be able to check the settings on the lobby before you join. If everything looks right you'll join in without having to update your region or chat type - it'll change automatically (if you have the proper permissions)! Pretty snazzy, imo. Even More Roles! 2? 3?? 4??? We added the Noisemaker, Tracker, and Phantom last June bringing the total number of roles up to 7! Why stop there when we could introduce even more levels of deception and chaos? We're being ambitious and aiming to bring in... uh... 2? 3?? 4??? new roles this year. We're still testing them out for ultimate fun-ness. (Real word I made up.) The goal will be as many as we can, but don't yell at us if you only get 2. (Fun fact: We have about 12 different new role ideas cooking.) Our goal is to bring our own twist to roles while still balancing gameplay for all platforms, so it's always an interesting science experiment. Hope you enjoy them when they're out! SPOILER: Right now, the most promising roles we're testing involve poison and maybe some detective work... but we'll see. 🧐 And now you get to brag that you have insider knowledge because you read the roadmap. Proud of you. Cosmetics + Collabs It's not truly a plan for 2025 if we don't increase your aura with the finest of bean drip. We'll have some, killer, cute, and of course fabulous collabs with other studios in the works. You won't know what hit (or ejected) you. And it's not just collab cosmetics either! Our art team is dreaming up some fun Cosmicubes to drop throughout the year with new themes we haven't dressed these unsuspecting space beans in yet. Security Updates Am I being a hater for calling security updates boring? I guess they could keep Impostors away. Hmm. Anyway, we wanted you to know we're constantly working on keeping Among Us (and your tasks) running smoothly and compliant with current legal and safety laws. With more server optimizations and anti-cheats, you're gameplay experience should hopefully continue improving. Among Us TV I KNOW. I KNOW EVERYONE HAS BEEN ASKING ABOUT THIS. CBS FREE ME FROM MY CHAINS OF SECRECY I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMOREEEEEEE. Things are COOKING. There will be news SOON. It's a blast being the bean who gets to share these plans with you! There's so much on the horizon for Among Us and the team can't wait to make it a reality. We'll be talking about these items and more soon! Off to charge my headset, Dors {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/94d8655eeaae4a22739ed8719791e8b7a5e11d66.png P.S. We're not the only ones with Among Us plans to share.

945360,Innersloth Turns 10!,"HAPPY NEW YEAR AND WELCOME BACK, BEANS! We hope you had a peaceful holiday as we ejected 2024, and we’re excited to kick off yet another year of mischief and chaos with our first updates. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/fd503b2ce38e02a3266a2cc780842e5e6ab4c88d.png First things first, we’re excited to share that Innersloth just turned 10 years old! Technically, our 10th anniversary was on January 5th LOL but shhh…. We were still vacationing, so this is close enough. Now that we’re back though, we're excited to party with you and will be giving away an exclusive Sloth mask! The mask will drop on January 8 at 18:00 UTC and be available until April 8 at 17:00 UTC, so keep your visors peeled. A Message from Our Co-Founders Our Sloth Fathers, PuffballsUnited and ForteBass wanted to pass along a message to everyone reading. Hello everyone!  Marcus and Forest here, we just wanted to give our biggest thanks to everyone for supporting Innersloth for the last ten years!  Whether you were a fan from Dig2China or Among Us (maybe you even played Henry Stickmin on Newgrounds before Innersloth???), it's been so wonderful to see everyone enjoy and play our games. Here's a few shout outs maybe you were around for: Like the first 10 Discord members were all Moldovans, shout out to those folks. Shout outs to Buddy, wherever you are. Of course, shout outs to Newgrounds. Marcus and a few others at Innersloth wouldn't be where they are now without it. Shout outs to Adobe, please fix some bugs in Flash (aka Adobe Animate). Shout out to all the partner business that got us through the pandemic. Thank you for holding our hands during Mr. Bone's Wild Ride. Thanks to all of the moderators - past and present - for manning our Discord, Reddit, and In-Game. Finally, thanks to anyone who ever made or shared a Crewmate meme. We loved.... almost all of them. We've grown so much since Among Us blew up and are now able to share our dream with so many people thanks to your support. We have so many projects started now: Outersloth funding games The Among Us TV Show New Among Us updates and collabs Two whole new games in progress. We're so excited to share all of it with you in the coming years.  Anyways, idk what else to say so thank you again so much from Marcus, myself and everyone at Innersloth. Wiping my tears as I type ;-; For real though, thank you all for the support you’ve given us throughout the years! We look forward to many more birthdays and we’re happy we get to celebrate with all you cool beans. Speaking of celebrations… If you haven't turned up and claimed the 2025 NYE cosmetic yet, this is your last chance!

945360,Big Bug Update and New Fixes | v2024.10.29,"It's time for our BIGGGG bug update, Crewmates! Our programmers have been hard at work yeeting bugs that have been creepy crawling their way into the game. Some of them you wouldn't have seen but trust us - they're gone now. If you see any bugs disrupting your perfect Impostor plans send us a ticket! Make sure your game is updated to v2024.10.29 for the fixes. Patch Notes {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/8c69b28b52f95676501c5421e499e83468b2bbea.gif Don't worry about Yellow... they're fine. They just helped fix the following: Trying to start an Online lobby while permanently or temporarily banned will no longer put the game into an endless black screen. Remember to play nice. Updated the Tracker's ability to display as ""TRACK"" instead of ""TRACKER"". The ""Room Code Copied"" text will now disappear after you copy the room code. Fixed the misaligned cursors in the chat, 'Edit Name', and 'Add Friend' windows. Corrected visuals for viewing the Store and Wardrobe while playing at 3440x1440 resolution. - We lowered the volume of The Skeld song in the lobby. Sorry it was too loud! You can adjust the volume further with the volume slider in the settings. - The friends list icon no longer moves when accepting a game invite. - Chat bubbles shouldn't break through the chat window when scrolling. - The visor and hat on the host icon are now layered correctly. - Hats now layer correctly when stacking with other players on the Dropship. - Fixed layering issues for chat in multiple windows. - Fixed inconsistent fonts being displayed for special characters. - Game setting updates now display with the correct icons and colors when popping up on the left side of the screen. - The plus and minus buttons in the role settings will continue to work after you select a game preset. - The plus and minus buttons in the role settings no longer stay highlighted after selecting them. - Button click SFX no longer occur when you click the map icon during the start of a game. - The practice dummies will now respawn after calling an Emergency Meeting. - Visors are layered correctly during ladder animations. - We removed a controller button icon that appeared during the Inspect Samples task even if you weren't using a controller. - Crewmates don't get frozen in the climbing animation if a Mushroom Mixup is called while on the ladder. Okay - deep breath! Thanks for your patience as we got through all these fixes. We're always on the look out for glitches and bugs that are disruptive. If you see any, remember to submit a ticket! Hacking {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/05e4daf7bb079a53e55e9d33b6d21312acf67cea.png This update is a great time to let you know that the our backend team worked tirelessly to fix the slew of hacks in the last few months which have been impacting lobbies. Combating hacks is like resolving Sabotages - when you fix one another might appear later. Just like when you see a bug, you can report a hack to us by submitting a ticket. Any info you can send is helpful in making sure we can keep Among Us free of disruptive behavior that takes the fun away (outside of Impostors of course). Try to be descriptive, and if you can get pictures (or video), then that helps out even more! It's like an Emergency Meeting - anything you can add beyond ""I saw a thing"" gives the team a better shot at solving the mystery. Art Time We've talked bugs. We've talked hacks. How about we wind down with some community fan art? First up is a piece worthy of being evidence from Waffles! on X (Twitter)! The Miles Edgeworth drop brought a lot of excitement and seeing art like this made it even better. Literally no objections. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/557cd4163aa9737fd89df2281a6c613b5683152b.jpg Up next is Nyan from our official Discord channel!

Obviously the first port of call you'd expect for an Ace Attorney crossover of any kind is with everyone's best boy Phoenix Wright, but late last night <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/companies/innersloth"">Innersloth</a> announced that its next collaboration would feature Wright's own rival stroke boyfriend Miles Edgeworth. There's a pretty simple explanation for this one though, as in case you forgot, the latest Ace Attorney collection from Capcom, <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-announced-at-june-nintendo-direct"">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a>, is all about Miles, so that'll be why you'll be able to get him as a free cosmetic in Among Us that's dropping on September 9. It's unclear if this is a limited time only kind of deal, so if you're an avid Among Us and/ or Ace Attorney fan, you might want to hop on this one quickly. Ace Attorney Investigations Collection was announced back in June, during Nintendo's Not-E3 Direct, and was a pretty big deal for a lot of fans of the series. While the first game in the pair of titles included in the collection made it outside of Japan, its sequel, Prosecutor's Gambit, has so far only ever been available in Japanese. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/among-us-is-getting-an-ace-attorney-collaboration"">Read more</a> ",1725268402,

There's also a visual indicator of their death that appears on screen so your fellow Crewmates can run to catch the Impostor red handed (even if it's not Red). {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/0b931c3305ebb505a1ba6fe1089d3ba22a8c64a0.gif New Impostor Role - Phantom 👻 If you've ever wanted to just up and disappear when you're the Impostor, I have great news. Our new Impostor role, the Phantom, has the ability to turn invisible! Want to escape after the perfect kill? Active your ability and sneak right by those dum Crewmates. Just remember it's for a limited time to plan your escapes and appearances well! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/dcd38d1a86720c1264b66e55ad28a35be7ec5671.gif Lobby Settings When you spawn in the lobby you'll notice that there's a big empty space where the lobby settings used to be! Our user interface expert, Lucy, worked really hard with our programmers to make the settings look beautiful and only a button click away. The right side of the screen now has a menu to clearly display the room code, map, number of Crewmates, privacy, and game setting presets - more on that later. When you're a Crewmate waiting for the host, you'll be able to view the settings that are applied by selecting 'View' to pop out a handy overview menu so you can see what the host has set up. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/cde0f1633a7a9ad9774c6b5c0ea5983e1ebc44e6.png If you're the host, you'll have a slightly different menu to tweak and dial in the settings for the next round when you select the 'Edit' button. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/552bb5185f14c55bc62e6fb65db1b95b045bd540.gif In our handy dandy gif (pronounce it jif and you get ejected), you can find our Game Presets I mentioned earlier! Those allow you to quickly change the setup between two options: Core Settings - for those looking for a classic Among Us feel with no extra roles. Just you, your fellow Crewmates, and some Impostors. Roles Galore - for those looking to spice up their lobbies by adding in roles to the mix (mmmmm, rolls). You can set the chances of the Tracker, Engineer, Scientist, Guardian Angel, Shapeshifter, and Phantom to be in the game. We also have two presets available for Hide N Seek: Pitch Dark - for those courageous Crewmates who want to hide in the darkness without a flashlight. Flashlights - for those who like shining the light on things... like your Crewmates killed by the Seeker. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/919f7412d845111576f6725b011e8ff5c493d547.png Patch Notes That's a lot of newness happening, but it wasn't just new items the team was working on. We also have a lot of patches so be sure to update your game to v2024.6.18 for these fixes: The Fungle - Crewmates wont be stuck in the ladder climb animation if a Mushroom Mixup happens while climbing a ladder Shapeshifters who are climbing a ladder when a meeting is called will not longer get stuck in the climbing animation Airship and The Fungle as Shapeshifter - The Shapeshift duration timer now counts down correctly under all conditions Classic and Hide N Seek - Desolation of Skeld Pet will now appear during matches and not guard their hoard in the dropship Quick Chat - Text in the chat field will have the same colors as the quick chat builder iOS - The ""Pending Account Deletion"" message is no longer hidden by the Friend List bar Child Accounts that become old enough to be full accounts will now receive permissions correctly Scientist - The battery duration timer is is no longer blocked by the settings icon on some resolution settings The Great Goalie visor now layers correctly with certain hats Skeld - An extra button no longer appears on screen during the second part of the Inspect Sample task (Takes a deep breath) That was a whole lot of stuff!

That's right, it's a whole series production based on our very own game. Earlier this year the entire voice cast was revealed, which included: Randall Park Ashley Johnson Yvette Nicole Brown Elijah Wood Dan Stevens Kimiko Glenn Liv Hewson Patton Oswalt Debra Wilson Phil LaMarr Wayne Knight Owen Dennis is the creator and executive producer on the project, while Titmouse are the animation studio for the series. And don't worry - we're involved too! Fortebass and Puffballs are serving as executive producers, we well as Carl Neisser. You can bet it still has all the same humor Forte and Puff are known for in all our games... which is to say it's going to be very, very chaotic lol. Just the way we like it. Enjoy!

945360,Outersloth: Our New Indie Game Fund!,"Hey Sloth fans! (Or Sloth haters...???) It’s no secret the games industry has been through a lot of turmoil with layoffs and a lack of funding. Innersloth is incredibly lucky to have been able to find success and stay truly independent: no investors, no publishers, no acquisitions. This, of course, is all thanks to you for supporting us!!! Sharing our success and seeing more indies games become sustainable is incredibly important to the team, which is why we made Outersloth, our indie game fund! Some devs don't really get the chance they deserve, so we thought maybe we could help out a little bit. We made this indie game fund to offers deals we would've wanted to have back in our less popular Amongie days. This is our way of saying thank you to our Crewmates, players, and peers - by helping some games and devs have the funding and freedom needed to ship their games. And then we all get to play them. Which was maybe our real plan. Shh. As seen at this year’s Summer Game’s Fest, 8 titles are currently under our funding arm: Battle Suit Aces, Trinket Studio – From the creators of Battlechef Brigade, lead a plucky crew to turn the tide against a star-consuming threat. Recruit ace pilots, upgrade their mecha Battle Suits, and captain your own epic tale in this card-battling RPG. Project Dosa, Outerloop Studio – From the creators of Thirsty Suitors, discover and cook new dosa recipes, help the locals, and fight off enemies in your mech to reunite with your loved ones. Mars First Logistics, Shape Shop - Build physically simulated rovers and transport awkwardly shaped cargo across the surface of Mars. Mossfield Archives, Studio Any Percent – A relaxing and beautiful game about exploring and building connections. ONE BTN BOSSES, Midnight Munchies - It's in the name. You have one button. There are big bosses to beat. Push, tap, and bash to beat them. Upgrade your ship, change your playstyle, and do it all over again! Rogue Eclipse, HUSKRAFTS – A thrilling spaceflight action game inspired by Arabesque Futurism. New games by Visai Games (Venba) and Strange Scaffold (El Paso, Elsewhere) have also been funded, but have yet to be revealed. Outersloth is our passion project and dream for a better, more sustainable industry. We don't want to have credit, authority, or claims over a game or company - we just want to good games to get made. For more information on any of the games listed, visit the Outersloth website.

945360,Among Us 2024 Roadmap,"Helloooooo Crewmates, Our roadmap for 2024 is here! Yes... I know... half the year has almost gone by. I will accept my punishment of ejection on their behalf (but I'll still cry about it). Are you wondering why it took so long to share? It's a good question. Our team was redefining our process for updates and how we organize them, finding out what matters most *looks at that player survey from a couple months ago*, and taking a well deserved nap, etc.. Roadmap 2024 - Our Plans {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/157e4ca6f8fa83c36db12794d382545828f39f40.png New Roles Since we introduced the Engineer, Scientist, Guardian Angel, and Shapeshifter back in 2021, new roles has been one of the highest requested additions to the game - and for good reason! Roles introduced a new way to betray and bewilder Crewmates, and more ways to gather evidence against the Impostors. Soon we'll introduce more brand new roles each with their own little quirk that make for some very interesting lobbies. I can't guarantee they'll help you avoid an untimely ejection but who knows... it's all about how you play! Better Lobby Filtering We're improving how you find lobbies through a more refined set of search settings. Make the Lobby Settings Pretty Our looooooooong list of settings is getting a facelift. Say hello to snappy menus so you can easily see all the settings you can change as a host, and have a quick view of the important ones as you join lobbies. Cosmetics and Collabs Our true calling - Bean fashion. We're cooking up more ways for you to slay while you slay. 💅 Y'all know how we get down with the cute, goofy, and chaotic collabs with other studios. We're rolling the dice and hoping to continue blowing your minds this year. No one is safe. (sorry Red) Quality of Life Along with the lobby settings and filtering mentioned above, we're sprucing up other items that will make your ears (do Crewmates even have ears?) perk up. We're cooking up other changes too - music for the lobbies (a Puffballs United original of course), Crewmate chatter popping at the top of the screen, and more. More + This is where I'm allowed to talk about . Can't say more than that 'cause we like surprising you! Wooooooo, that's a lot of stuff! The team is hard at work checking notes and prepping their tasks to make these plans a reality, so don't expect all of these to be completed in the order shown above. We're excited and can't wait to get these changes into your lovely, non-Impostor-knife-wielding hands. Off to decipher my part of the roadmap, Dors {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/94d8655eeaae4a22739ed8719791e8b7a5e11d66.png",1715187648,
945360,April Fools' goes necks-gen,"We've waited a long time for this one, Crewmates. For April Fools', we've upgraded the game to have necks-gen graphics (our game designer Dave really stuck his neck out for this joke)! As per tradition, we have come up with the most cursed idea we could to celebrate. Say goodbye to horses - they're not real anyway - and say hello to NECK. We're committing to the bit by bringing you a whole week of cursed Long Among Us. (L'mong Us? Hm.) That's right - April Fools' Mode will be available from April 1st - 8th. Don't worry, though - if it's too much for you, we built in a handy toggle button so you can turn it off and have normal beans... whatever ""normal"" is to you. The Long and Short of It {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/d654c5d90d2e8e59b0a657283d1bbd9c2fcc93fa.png This year we decided to find out how tall is too tall for a Crewmate. The answer is that there's no such thing. Remember this is a limited time event, so hop on now to experience life above knee height. (Did you know Crewmates are canonically 3'6"" or 1.09m tall?) Here's what you can expect: Note - Some cosmetics will be unavailable during April Fools' long mode. Classic Mode Crewmates, Ghosts, and Impostors have had a growth spurt and grow to new heights Shapeshifters will become the height of their target Special kill animation Ejection animations with taller Crewmates Hide n Seek Seeker now has a long neck Heights of Crewmates change based on their distance from the Seeker If you don't want to wait until the 8th to go back to being a normal bean - don't worry. You can turn off the April Fools' mode from the lobby creation screen. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/8ff25b40738996c996a706f2b0987044499a0827.png Merch Time It wouldn't be a complete April Fools' celebration without some really awesome and totally real merch you can pick up from our store.

945360,Banishing Bothersome Bugs,"March! That's not a command - just the month of this devlog! On the heels of our Lunar New Year cosmetic drops, it's now time for a few changes. We also have a bunch of fixes and quality-of-life updates to make it even easier to complete your tasks. Hint: the task is to betray your friends. Before you get ejected, let's take a peak. NOTE: v2024.3.05 IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OLDER VERSIONS. UPDATE YOUR GAME TO KEEP PLAYING WITH EVERYONE. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/3233894b015d4b1b286c6b162017152f1e72532f.png Fixing more than just the vibes While a Crewmate's life can be cut drastically short (don't look at me like that), it doesn't mean we can't give it a little bump in quality - don't worry Impostors, this is for you too. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/144c77b80175735899ed955ca783fbf60e49b04b.png Here's the list of fixes with today's update: Crewmates will no longer teleport or 'snap' to a task when starting one. Main Menu no longer goes to black screen after quickly selecting a map from the Practice Menu. A variety of cosmetic fixes so you can continue having good drip. RB and R1 prompts don't appear on the screen twice when using cams on controller. Lobby Settings won't remain on screen at the start of a match. Previewing items in a Cosmicube display on your selected Crewmate color instead of defaulting to Red. The Impostor count no longer reduces twice when an ejected Impostor leaves the game. Crewmates will not get stuck in the climbing animation while on a ladder when a sabotage ends. Crewmates hats no longer float behind them when riding the zipline. They finally hold onto their hats. Crewmates will no longer clip through the map if they are using the zipline or ladders when a sabotage ends. The ""You're Boned"" cosmetic icon is now correctly displayed. That is quite a healthy list of fixes but our programmers will be vigilant and keep looking to fix more bugs as they show themselves! If you think you've seen one scuttling about, please send us a support ticket so we can get to squashing. I'm gonna hand the update over to Mike and I'll see you all again at the bottom of the page. (Please read that far, we work so hard on this.) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/94d8655eeaae4a22739ed8719791e8b7a5e11d66.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/ac6426ec0548252afae71ba15a0a3f10390b3db9.png STOMP STOMP STOMP Hey, Crewmates! We're still busy STOMP STOMP squishing as many STOMP bugs as we STOMP STOMP can. Phew! But the task never ends, and we're always on the lookout for new bugs to crush. Some are tricky, though, and take a while to figure out even after we know where they like to hide. Down below you'll find a short list of bugs we already know about but that we haven't quite figured out the best way to stomp out. Known Bugs: Crewmates may sometimes leave their hand behind on the zipline. Player's left hand may not appear as the correct color while wearing the Right Hand Man skin and using the zipline. After attempting to merge a temporary account into a full account, some players may experience a Friendcode Fail error preventing account login Impostors may teleport to a vent near a Crewmate when the Crewmate completes the ""Clean Vent"" task, even if the Impostor was not in the vent at the time. As always, please send in a bug report any time you find a bug or an error in-game! Be sure to be as descriptive as you can and send along any pictures or video clips that might help us work on the problem.

Thank you for being such amazing fans who love to complete tasks (and betray each other)! We’ll be doing a special celebration dev stream today (June 15) at 12pm PT/3pm ET on our Twitch channel. Before I get carried away here’s a message from Fortebass and PuffballsUnited: Crewmates! Thank you so much for playing over the past 5 years! It’s been such an amazing journey for us here at Innersloth. All the fan art, the hilarious gameplay clips, the memes, we love it all! I never thought the little random bean I made would become so prevalent everywhere and for that I’m truly humbled. Sincerely, thank you everyone for enjoying the game and I hope you stick around for all the things we have in store. PuffballsUnited {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/079c6e1665e8f9ad8514816c371bfd87fb168948.png Y'know, I don't think I remind people enough that Among Us was supposed to be one of a series of 6-month games while Marcus made The Henry Stickmin Collection. Just a little thing to make and move on from. I feel like that makes it extra crazy to think about 5 years of Among Us and know that we still have plenty in store. And I'm so grateful that we were able to make an amazing team and share the ride. So to everyone who played Among Us or even just drew a crewmate in a foggy window: Thank you! I really feel like some of the best is yet to come! Fortebass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/af367480d6b3d8f6b440bf8a97118f87ede79871.png Party Time It's time to break out the party hats, grab a slice of pizza-cake, and blow up some balloons! Speaking of balloons, if you log in to Among Us today you'll get this free star balloon hat - it's really Five out of Five! It looks great with a pair of the new Stunner Shades!

That means it's time to go out and smell the flowers in the MIRA HQ Greenhouse, or if you're like me - beg for mercy from your allergies. (This visor isn't blocking any pollen!! WHY!!!) The team had a lot of fun seeing your reactions to our silly April Fools Horse Mode plus the rancher version of the Seek theme last month. While we're all done horsing around, the team is getting back to work on some super important tasks. Let's check it out! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/eddc221ed2f9395b993256cef69465c5ba111188.png Super Important Tasks Let's take a peek at some of the tasks we've been working on, starting with our UI/UX specialist, Lucy! She was kind enough to let us peek at her current task, which is a full Quick Chat rework. Here are some fun things you can expect: New interface. Say bye bye to the old Radial Menu! Refined categories More remarks and phrases A way to favorite your most used phrases More that I won't spoil {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/9716276d85a678f40f2f32c4a2b7193d2cb7294e.png Image is not the final version of this feature That's the quick look at how things are going with Quick Chat. We're really excited to get this update in your hands for an even better (and quicker), chatting experience. Quick Chat isn't the only task the team is working on either. As I peeped the vitals pad to make sure the team was adequately hydrated and caffeinated, I was able to get a little update from our Game Designer, Dave! Map 5 Dave: “Map 5 is going great! There are a lot of new things that I can’t wait for everyone to see and play with. There might even be some parts of the map that look familiar but are very different…” And with that, Dave jumped into a vent and got back to work making sure we're all on the right page for everything going into map 5. Hm. Hope he's actually an Engineer like he said he was... Player Survey Speaking of reaching out to us, have you ever wanted to let us know how you're really feeling about Among Us? Have cool ideas for the beans? Then fill out this handy Player Survey to let us know! It should only take about 5 - 10 minutes and your feedback will help Crewmates everywhere. Thanks for taking the time! Let's take a look in Electrical... Have you ever wanted Among Us merch themed after everyone's favorite room on the Skeld? Good thing we worked with some amazing artist to create the Murder Room Bundle! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/4c49f7d7aa419f65fa6babcc79aeef54420f45cc.png This collection is super special - all the pieces are made by fans like you!

They'll be here to help wrangle bugs and answer your questions as our Player Support Specialist! Welcome in, Mike! Thanks, Dors! Hey there, friends! I'm Mike, the new guy in Player Support here at Innersloth. Hopefully everything goes smoothly for every Crewmate out there, but if you do ever need help, you can rest assured that I'm behind the scenes sorting out a solution. Think of me as a helpful bean always out there. Watching. Lurking...  Ahem. What was I saying? Oh, right.  It's my job to squash bugs and make sure you're all having a good time, even when you're being munched by an Impostor. Especially then! If you see me around the community, feel free to say hi! But please be sure to send all requests for support through the Help Center so I can keep track and make sure you get what you need.  Until next time!  Mike {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/bfc18cce7bee9cb7f9697f2cec8a50cd3250f8ef.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/618eeee13185d1ac5407e218ccf5b8d24fb27c12.png Hiya Crewmates!

Great work on your piece, DemonElectro7819! Next up is a video from AdasAtelier! They re-created the jeep complete with map, Crewmates, and Impostor that our artist Hannako drew for the roadmap in 2022! I'm pretty sure I heard jaws drop in the studio when I shared this with the team! Great work on bringing this piece to life. That's all for this round Crewmates!

945360,The Return of Horse Mode - v2023.3.28,"Yeehaww, Crewmates! It's time to wrangle all you Crewmates and Impostors who like to horse around instead of doing your tasks (remember to do your tasks, Ghosts!). Before you ride off, here is what's happening in v2023.3.28: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/eddc221ed2f9395b993256cef69465c5ba111188.png Fun Stuff New Cosmetics! Check out the in-game store for several new cosmetics including hats, nameplates, and visor. Better yet, they’ll only cost BEANS! And lucky you – an Impostor sabotaged some of the pricing on the nameplates so they’re cheaper than they should be. We’ll get that fixed up in the next update but for now, enjoy! APRIL FOOLS DAY IS COMING. Can you hear it? The sounds of hooves echoing in the halls of the Skeld and across the alien landscape of Polus? That’s right – an improved Horse Mode is returning for April Fool’s from March 31 – April 2! That’s a whole weekend of HORSE! In case you missed it last year, we turned all the Crewmates into Horsemates. That’s it. It started from a joke tweet we made 2 years ago and spiraled wildly out of control because we laughed wayyyy too much at the idea of it. The best part? We’ve added a whole new Horse Wrangling mode to it… AKA Hide n Seek mode will turn into a horse-y surprise. Make sure to check back around April Fools to see what we have planned. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/126386c1667b827934958c8bd41b167cea6930e4.png Along with the return of Horse Mode, we'll have some really fun and totally legit merch available for purchase like our Crewmate costumes and Horsemate pins. Be on the lookout for brand new merch on sale April 1st! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/4ac8b4c92db28d95dee5b9ead671092388da4e37.png Before I get carried away trying to add all the merch to my cart, let's take a look at the patches notes for v2023.3.28 and see what bugs have been squashed by the hooves of Horse Mode. Patch Notes - Players will no longer get stuck on a black screen if the Seeker leaves during the reveal screen. Players will see a reveal screen and once gameplay begins the game will end with 'Impostor Disconnected' if a new Seeker isn't chosen. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/6aaefd249567ae3879363114c2bb49d2adafe83f.png - Task arrows no longer get stuck on screen after a comms sabotage - Players will no longer see lobbies mixed with assets from the Skeld - Players can no longer be killed while the vent animation is being completed Due to latency, the animation may still play under certain circumstances - Impostor can now use 'click to kill' when a Ghost is located directly over another player's Crewmate - Impostor or Seeker can no longer clip into the wall when trying to kill a Crewmate while they are climbing a ladder Player skins now load onto Crewmate correctly when spawning in lobby Shapeshifter pet is now displayed correctly if Impostor shapeshifts into a Crewmate with a pet Players blocked in the Friends List are displayed properly Fixes to Right Hand Man kill animations Winning or losing a game in Practice will now reset the practice game I really gotta hand it to the QA and programming teams for knocking out even more bugs to help make betraying your friends a much smoother experience! If you think you've found a bug or hiccup in your experience remember to send us a Helpdesk ticket or email support at support@innersloth.com. That's all for this section, Crewmates! Read on to see what Known Bugs are in this update. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/ac6426ec0548252afae71ba15a0a3f10390b3db9.png I know what you're thinking - 'Dors is in Krys's Bug Zone' taking up valuable Player Support space. Well, let it be known that I'm just here to help tell you what known bugs are a part of v2023.3.28: Oops! Some new nameplate cosmetics are priced incorrectly. This will be fixed in the next update to match the rest of the pricing. And there we have it - a shortlist for this round of updates but we're hoping to get these bugs resolved for you all ASAP! Keep reading to see who's creating in the Fun Zone. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/618eeee13185d1ac5407e218ccf5b8d24fb27c12.png This month's art zone had some really heartwarming pieces!

945360,Bungie Collab and Announcements Update v2023.2.28 | Emergency Meeting #36,"It's February, Crewmates! Errr... it was February and boy if it didn't go by in a flash. I hope it was a great month full of finished tasks and you were able to suss out those Impostors. This month we have some sweet things to share for Among Us including some really cool new cosmetics, changes to our announcements, and various fixes as a part of your latest update - v2023.2.28! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/eddc221ed2f9395b993256cef69465c5ba111188.png Fun Stuff Our first collab of the year begins with the Guardian Cosmicube, available on our store for 3500 Beans! This cube is packed full of cosmetics so you can chase Impostors, pet your pets, and complete your tasks as your favorite light-wielding Guardians from our friends at Bungie. Be sure to get your Guardian Cube by May 30, 2023 before it disappears! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/ae6e832f58112832265ce2b1b1a7dce69bffed07.png Patch Notes Our announcements have a brand new look to them! Not only will it have that new Skeld smell, but you'll have the ability to see past announcements we've posted in case you want to see what happened in prior updates! This is what our announcements used to look like: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/1ee7ce43140aeead0a44c468ee721efecd801510.png While this has been working well - the team thought it could do with a little sprucing up. That's where our UI expert Lucy comes in! Thanks to their efforts we now have a page that looks a little something like this: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/bf5bd3c3a726531c9d258de9a669cb79e5fa0117.png Doesn't this look great? I can't reveal too many secrets, but this is just the first of our passes for updated UI for Among Us! We'll have plenty more in store for some cool new looks. And of course, we did some serious fixing in this patch to make sure your game runs smoother!: 'Freeplay' is now called 'Practice' New updated player report and pet petting icons Pets no longer give away an Engineer's position when venting Guardian Angel can no longer protect Crewmates while comms are sabotaged Shapeshifters no longer get banned from match when attempting to shift into player who has left the match Shapeshifters are no longer considered Crewmate Ghosts in matches with 2 or more Impostors The first ejected Impostor now becomes a Ghost Impostor, rather than a Ghost Crewmate Crewmates are able to win a match by completing tasks even after the first Impostor is ejected in a 2+ Impostor match Players are now unable to see players jumping out of vents and teleporting to the Cafeteria when Emergency Meeting is called Polus - The upper and lower horizontal doors for decontamination can now be opened Admin now shows location of dead bodies That's a whole lot of fixes and we'll be squashing as many as possible as we keep updating and improving our other systems in Among Us. As a quick reminder - if you think you've found a bug feel free to report it to us at our Help Desk or email us at support@innersloth.com. See you very soon, Dors {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/94d8655eeaae4a22739ed8719791e8b7a5e11d66.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/ac6426ec0548252afae71ba15a0a3f10390b3db9.png I bet you didn't think I'd just keep writing and writing and end up down in the Bug Zone too, did you? Well... Good news is that Krys is helping me doublecheck our list of known bugs for v2023.2.28! Thankfully, the list of bugs isn't too long and we're hoping to have these squashed ASAP: Flashlight can't be moved while pet animation is in progress while using a controller Flashlight cone will reset its position if there is no player input after 8 seconds Crewmates killed at the same time as venting will see the vent arrows persist while being a Ghost Player Ghosts can shoot out of the map when attempting to haunt and immediately opening the Settings menu Killing while petting your pet can cause the pet animation to keep playing Vent arrows stay on screen if killed while venting Players will see indefinite black screen if internet connection is lost while loading into an online game That's all for bugs right now! We'll keep you updated as we knock more out with our next updates. See you next round, Dors & Krys {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/18eba3b9059a98c3ec79bfa93e94058d2c120f86.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/618eeee13185d1ac5407e218ccf5b8d24fb27c12.png We got another solid round of community creations and art this month too!

I’m not allowed to spill the beans (hehe) on all the secrets but I think there’s a lot to get hyped about. Confession: I was supposed to publish this on Jan 31 but I totally forget heh. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/7d49c8f2165d3f81683d62dab34eb13cb86635a5.png First off – we want to make playing Among Us an easier, more intuitive experience. This means big focus on adding multiple updates to the UI and UX (user interface and user experience, respectively) of the game. Cleaning up the account merging flow, updating the store to be easier to navigate, making it easier to see how you can report a toxic player… these are all things we want to work on, and more. We don’t want anything to get in the way of you and your tasks. Digging further into our roadmap, here are some further detail for you (but I can’t spoil anything so be patient with meeeeee): Map 5: Yep, this is finally the year we get you a whole new map to explore! I can’t tell you what the theme is, but I CAN say it’ll have all new tasks for you to figure out, come with more cosmetics, and have fun surprises hidden around. We put a TON of love into our design process for these maps – you’ll notice that all our maps often have tinyyy details in them to make them feel satisfying and fun to play, if you take a look around. (My favorite details is the little bone anatomy image in the Airship.) We don’t want to skimp out on anything, so we’re excited to finally be gearing this map up for you to play later in the year! Improved Matchmaking: With Hide n Seek mode, new roles, and the customization of our lobbies, we realize that many of you want to be able to find the games you want to play more easily and quickly.

945360,NEW GAME MODE: Hide n Seek is here! | Emergency Meeting #35,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/eddc221ed2f9395b993256cef69465c5ba111188.png Hey there, Crewmates and Impostors!  Super excited to share our brand new game mode as part of v2022.12.8: Hide n Seek! The team has been hard at work building this new mode which brings some heart-racing action alongside our classic social deduction form of Among Us. I wont spoil all of the surprises but here’s a few pointers for Hide n Seek: If you’re a Crewmate, your goal is to complete tasks to run down the timer and survive until the time is up to win. If you’re the Impostor, your goal is to eliminate all the Crewmates! Do tasks – they make the timer go down faster {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/d49bcf6e77770c810c04fa03593b2df02ac109b7.png Watch your danger meter! If the Impostor is far away, the danger meter will be empty. The closer an Impostor is, the more the bar will fill up (red means they’re REALLY close) and the louder the music gets! Crewmates get a limited number of vents in this mode, so use them wisely to escape. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/930eb4e821f56a4b3e189d386df5253c77cf47ea.png FINAL HIDE! These are the last few moments of the game where the Impostor gets a power boost, special Seek map, and a directional ping to where any surviving Crewmates are. CRYING. SCREAMING. TERRIFIED. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/b8a5e08522d13cc409f6feed4e71a0dbe2d5380d.jpg And that’s Hide n Seek! It’s been a blast getting to see the team take this from the concept born from our community into a full-fledged mode. If you’re looking for a full rundown on how the mode works check out our How to Play guide or our in-game tutorial. Some more quick notes for Hide n Seek: All keybinds will be reset to default keybindings when the update is live. If you had them changed prior to the update remember to go in into the keybindings menu and change them. Other notable changes: New game filter options When looking for public lobbies or creating one, you are now required to designate what kind of lobby it is. Currently, there are four options: Beginner: Best for new players. Casual: Best for players just looking to have fun and not take the game too seriously. Serious: Best for players looking to win and play more deliberately. Expert: Best for players who know Among Us well. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/26a933b229e7bb4b270db0f197b841a3f58cae21.png Note: Filters will display with the exact options chosen. E.g. ""Beginner"" and ""Serious"" will find you lobbies tagged as BOTH those items. It will NOT list lobbies listed as only ""Beginner"" or ""Serious"". Pet your pets! You can now pet your lovable companions in-game and in lobbies. Stand near your pet and hold down the button to pet them. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/b834c4fe147d924b02a55b653e853555d40a551c.jpg New Haunt button. Died?

Be sure to grab yours when you can for some festive outings with your Crewmates.

Will get you a full list upon release, but here are some things to look forward to: New Cosmicube! 👀 You’ve been wanting more cosmetics and ways to spend your Stars and Beans, and don’t worry, something is coming. It’s a secret for now but let’s just say it’ll be delicious. Automatic game error reporting. This is more of a backend fix that you won’t see, but it’s cool enough to note! Essentially we’re implementing a system that alerts us if certain platforms or devices are experiencing weird crashes or other errors, which helps us pinpoint bugs to fix more easily. One step closer to getting an in-game bug reporting feature, wooOOOoOOo. The ability to change the map in the lobby settings without having to leave and start a new game. Small store and inventory redesigns, bug fixes, and more improvements. Keep an eye out! This will come out soon/at some point/in the future/eventually/one day. In the meantime, we have put out a hotfix in v2022.7.12 aimed at the networking issues for players in Egypt. If it goes well, it'll be pushed to other platforms. After the next update, Hide n Seek is still the big update we’re working on getting out this year and let’s just say we have a lot planned for it heheheh. In the meantime, have fun, play nice, sabotage those Crewmates!

I hope you’re looking forward to all the interstellar content we’ve got cookin’. We had a few hiccups since our last log, whether it be server interruptions or some login issues, but things were wrangled quickly—in no small part because all of YOU were quick to let us know and give us all the information we needed to eject those bugs right into space. Thank you for being so patient and kind when it comes to that kinda stuff! We are currently working hard to wrap up some weirdness involving Star purchasing and DLC, so please continue to let us know if you experience any problems related to these new things. And for some awesome news: we now have a ✨shiny✨ new Help Center!! You can troubleshoot common issues here, learn more about our game, and use our super helpful Support Ticket feature. This ensures that if you have an issue, we get as much problem-solving info from you as possible from the get-go—which means we can help you much faster!! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/1ae3110f8386be33a5fd68501f5d491a6bc1ac09.png That’s about it from me.

Dors here with more for the Fun Zone! Been having a lot of fun in our Discord with an emoji contest and even playing the best game of Among Us with members of the Discord. Much betrayal was had and we’re just getting started! If you haven’t joined for any of the above events or are looking for a space to share some fanart, chaotic conversations, or looking for fellow Crewmates to betray play with, consider joining. Also, if you haven't peeped our official Tiktok, you might see a new face making content- me! Don't worry. I'm not playing an Impostor. Maybe. We had quite a few great art finds. Check out the full dev log to see. Thanks for reading, Crewmates! TTFN, Dors {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/94d8655eeaae4a22739ed8719791e8b7a5e11d66.png",1658512168,

Our team worked SO HARD and we managed to fix 100+ issues that were bothering you in Among Us. Here’s a big list of most of them, so make sure you’re update to version 2022.6.21, now out on all platforms. First up: we’ve been listening to you! I know you’ve all wanted a lot of things improved in the game and I am happy to say we’ve changed some things to hopefully make your lives easier. Quality of Life Improvements & Implemented Community Suggestions Added a Streamer Mode. When active, room codes do not display in the lobby and is replaced by “Click to copy”. This can be toggled on or off in the General Settings. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/97ce0ff4a9848f99105b33a03f6941a17182f663.png Added Colorblind Settings. When active, the names of the colors will appear next to the players during meetings, and below the player during gameplay. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/91ac2a7432e9a68f759d15de0367aa300cf6b1e7.png Account linking is back. Follow the in-game instructions carefully as we’ve removed Guest Accounts, but it should make it an easier process. More information on the new Account Linking here. Players are now able to view the map from the voting screen. Friends List – The player’s last display name will appear above a player’s Friend Code. We definitely have wayyyy more planned in future, so keep playing the game and letting us know how you feel (nicely, pleaseeee) and I promise we’ll be listening. But I’m not done this post yet – now for the some of the many fixes which made it into the game. Biggest Fixes Loading screen now waits for every player in the lobby when loading into a round Kills can no longer happen when an Emergency Meeting is being called Players in game should no longer randomly lose the ability to interact with map, complete tasks, or kills Quick Chat wheel can be used as intended while a task (Download Data / Upload Data) is being completed. Players will no longer be forced to close and re-open chat Smooth Talker achievement can now be unlocked if the second to last Crewmate leaves the game Players should no longer see the ‘Sure is taking a while’ error message when launching Among Us Friend Codes no longer duplicate across all players when player and host rejoin lobby Resolved desync issue when player reports body while climbing ladder Redeem pop up message for Scream cosmetics no longer prompts. Redemption period for this cosmetic has passed! Players will no longer see ‘Sure is taking a while’ if game is set to languages other than English Players are now able to unlock the Circumventor achievement Entering the correct date of birth no longer registers the account as age 0 Added the Language server filter to the settings in the Lobby These are just a few of the fixes. For the entire list of fixes check out our dev log. Thanks for being understanding about how we needed to take this time to really improve the game. Your feedback means a ton to us, and we all wanted to make sure we could start really chipping away at things that bothered you, even if it meant having to put a pause on some new content. That being said, new content is still on the horizon, so watch out! A moment to celebrate! June 15 was a special day for Amongis… AmongUses… AmongUs-s-sses? Now matter the plural form- Among Us has turned 4! As part of our celebration we have brand new merch. We have the full suite of Crewmate colors, keycaps, and a bunch of new pins too. Grab yours at our store quick. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/9917943669fa96ce28a4e7693d90f37eaef72d04.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/6d4fc6af1af41fdca4efa4a74fe519939f80495d.jpg Okay now I’m actually done.

Players aim to complete tasks for money and collect enough resources to build their own houses. Meanwhile the 'imposter' player, taking on the role of the 'rich guy,' aims to trash the players' houses and kill or evict them from the map. In his video demonstrating the mod, which is currently under development by his company DoubleJump and not yet publicly available, SSundee is named as the capitalist imposter. Upon revealing his true form as a top hat-and-tails-wearing, monocle-sporting figure, sets about the map causing chaos among his fellow players. Much like a regular game of Among Us, players must complete a variety of tasks - although here there's no ship to be maintained and fixed, but rather jobs to be completed in order to receive payment. These include filling up cars at a petrol station and making pizzas by slapping tomato, cheese, and pepperoni slices onto a base. Completing these jobs earns players money, which can be used in conjunction with wood, nails, and cement found around the map to purchase a plot of land and begin construction on your dream home. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/mod-house-flipper"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/vr-release-date"">Leaked Among Us VR release date is a month after Starfield</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/horse-mode"">Among Us Horse Mode is a meme-turned-April Fools event</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/halo"">Master Chief looks sus in the Among Us Halo crossover</a> ",1653335289,
945360,Updates about the Update,"Hey Crewmates! Alright so I definitely missed doing an April dev log completely. Shh. Don’t tell anyone. I was busy cleaning out the vents. Before we look at the updates, wanted to let you all know that the Scream cosmetic redemption period is now over! Thanks to everyone who participated! This one is a shorter dev log as we prepare for our big bug crunch and quality of life update. As I mentioned in the previous post, this next update isn’t about new content, but on making sure Among Us is given the time and care it needs to function smoothly. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/c5559b7a8ece97fb86ed01a8e2b19234fbb29001.png We’ve been trying to meet everyone’s demands and add new content constantly. This meant other things have slipped through the cracks so the next update will be all about fixes – big kudos to our producer Kristi for making it all come together. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again - thank you so much for sticking with us! We appreciate the patience and encouragement! So far, we have 72(!!!) confirmed bug fixes, we’ll be adding some changes to accounts, and over 30 more things are currently being tested to see if they’ll make it into the update. Confirmed fixes and improvements include things like: Fixing 'Sure is taking a while' Offline error message when launching the game Cosmetic layering issues Rework of the age submission process Added the ability to view the map from the voting screen (no more forgetting where you were, hooray!) Friends List improvements Of course, there’s much more than that, but I’ll give you a full list once the update is out! There are other fun things happening too, but like always I am sworn to secrecy and must keep it stuffed in a vent until the time comes. Also – we have a new community manager on board! You’ll see Dors writing these dev logs at some point, so make sure you’re nice and friendly and not murder-y when you see him come around. But for now – let's go to Krys for the all- important Bug Zone updates.

It’s a short Bugdate (get it? Bug Update? No? OK) this dev log, so let’s get right to it: Everyone who submitted a request to Support to have their DLC regranted (and provided proof of purchase) should now have their stuff! If you don’t, please email logs@innersloth.com with a screenshot of your Account ID and your proof of purchase and we’ll take care of that for you ASAP. Since Friends List rolled out, we are aware that some of you have had issues verifying your age so that you can use this feature. It’s important to note that we don’t have a choice when it comes to the age verification requirement – the ~*government*~ needs to make sure that we’re keeping our younger players safe and that they have their parent/guardian’s permission to play! We really appreciate your patience and understanding when it comes to age verification. If you have any issues with SuperAwesome’s age verification process, feel free to email us at support@innersloth.com. You can read more about SuperAwesome and our Privacy Policy here too. That’s it for now. Thanks everyone!! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/18eba3b9059a98c3ec79bfa93e94058d2c120f86.png",1652814293,

As a reminder, for the next update we’re taking a step back and focusing on fixing a bunch of bugs and improving the flow of the game. Basically: don’t expect new content for the next update. As much as we know how excited you all get about new in-game features, we really want to make sure Among Us is given the time and care it needs to function smoothly.

It's everyone's favorite (?) bug smusher. Though to be fair, I don't really smush the bugs, I just take a magnifying glass to stare at the bug before and after the smushing occurs, adjusting my glasses like some megane anime villain as I do. And then I take a paper towel and gently remove the smush. And then, um, we never talk about the bug or the smushing that occurred ever again. ...AnywAY AHAHAAH LET'S TALK ABOUT BUGS SHALL WEfjkaLDfsdgjkl Known bugs from this Friends List update - We're currently aware of some release bugs that are present in this new update (v2022.3.29). We will be working on getting these fixed, but for now, they are present in the new build. The biggest ones are noted on our site. DLC Grants Ongoing - Account linking borked some accounts in November, this is true. We have been steadily and diligently rolling out grants to those of you who lose your DLC, and a huuuge chunk have been resolved at this point. As I said in the last Bug Corner, this is a manual process that takes time, so we definitely appreciate your patience! SSL Bug - this was a funny little bug that our backend programmers took a flyswatter to. It was a few days of disrupted play, but all should be well now! Account Reset Bug - we know this has been happening to a fair number of you, and we hope that the changes to account linking should resolve this. As always, contact support@innersloth.com if you're still having account/inventory issues. Age Verification - We partnered with SuperAwesome in 2021 to implement an age verification process that makes it so our younger players have a safe and fun experience playing Among Us. This process isn't foolproof (we err on the side of safety), and sometimes our adult players end up being asked to verify their age if they enter their birth year incorrectly. Please know that we hear your feedback, and we are hoping to streamline this process soon. Thanks for reading - see you next time!!

The popular <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/social-deduction-games-like-among-us"">social deduction game</a> may not have the breadth of licenses to play with as Fortnite but <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-15-best-indie-games-on-pc"">indie game</a> Among Us has had a few crossovers, including <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/arcane"">League of Legends Arcane</a> and most recently <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/roadmap-2022"">Ghostface from Scream</a> - although we can't imagine that anyone would trust a player wearing that. Conversely, everyone trusts Master Chief John-117 from the Halo series, so it'll surprise a lot of players when the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters"">FPS game</a>'s iconic green Spartan turns out to be the Imposter all along. While Innersloth hasn't provided any specific details, the crossover seems to feature an armless Master Chief outfit alongside a floating A.I.

As Innersloth <a href=""https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1507149928040042498"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reported on Friday</a>, its servers in North America and Europe were hit by denial of service (DDoS) attacks - causing players to receive constant error messages when they tried to go online. Innersloth was forced to take Among Us offline to fix the problem, while <a href=""https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1507800285392998401"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">jokingly complaining</a> about having to work at the weekend (tell me about it). <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/servers-down-ddos-hack"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/halo"">Master Chief looks sus in the Among Us Halo crossover</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/costumes-hats"">Among Us costumes: how to unlock seasonal skins and outfits</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/among-us/roadmap-2022"">Among Us devs confirm friend lists in 2022 roadmap</a> ",1648399171,

Prizes came in ten categories covering everything from control and text options to friendly training spaces. It was a fun awards show too, with good hosts, chat from devs, and even a special appearance from Van Wilder star Ryan Reynolds. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-accessibility-awards-celebrated-games-which-welcome-more-players"">Read more</a> ",1647368677,
945360,Friends List Progress | Dev Log,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/eddc221ed2f9395b993256cef69465c5ba111188.png Hi Crewmates! The team has been steadily working on our Roadmap, which you might’ve seen includes the Friends List update and quality of life improvements. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/0d0ce498f638d2297d22061f9dafaa9a692af3c4.png The Friends List is on track and looking good! We can’t wait for people to be able to finally keep track of all the neat beans they murder. The Friends List features will include: A unique friend code Ability to send and receive friend requests (duh) Invite friends to your own lobby See who you recently played with Ability to block players As a heads up, to make sure everything is streamlined works properly, we will temporarily stop the ability to link existing accounts together when the Friend’s List update launches. It’ll be fixed in a future update though! So consider this your early note to create an account if you haven’t yet already! You’ll know if you have a full account if the tab is highlighted in green (not orange.) Another easy way to see if you have a full account is if you have access to free chat or access to it if you're on a kids account. Remember you can reach out to support@innersloth.com if you have any issues with accounts! I do have some fun sneak peeks of how the Friends List are going though – check it out! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/b5e93ec5de3cc5bf46b55b7d645f4a80cb9fc1c0.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33836086/ff0508582cb66795e0264042c3cb701f24840959.png Now to address the quality of life changes – those are going to be pushed into a different update. We wanted to improve a bunch of aspects of the game flow like Cosmicubes, chat, and other UX, but honestly we overstretched how much we could get into the next update. The number of platforms we’re now on, plus the safety complications of a friends list that works across all of these is a FUN time. (Not fun.) So what we want to do is focus on one thing at a time right now. Basically, after Friends List is out, we’re taking a short break from pushing out new gameplay content to focus on a bug squashing update. We’ve really felt the pressure of trying to launch content updates because we know that’s what you’re excited about, but honestly, we want to really dig into some of the bugs that have been... Well, bugging you. Heh. Plus, we’ve been hiring more programmers on the team, so hopefully the bug squashing will be even faster! And after that...? Maybe some hide n seek. 🙈 Also! We’re introducing a new fun section into the monthly dev logs. We want to keep you informed of all the bug progress we make and/or are still working on, so from now on the monthly dev logs will include a nice section from Krys, our Player Support manager! That’s it from my end though, see y’all around.

Krys here from Player Support -- I wish I could say I’m like the exterminator around here, but I’m deathly afraid of bugs IRL (and in game, let’s be real). HOWEVER! I’m going to put on a brave face today and give all of you a few updates: Reliable packet issues - This is something we’ve been chipping away at for some time, and we’re sorry that some of you are still experiencing the reliable packet error message. We’re working tirelessly to find a solution to this problem! If you’re on Steam, we’re testing out a build (v.2022.2.24s) to see how much this alleviates the problems, and when it’s good to go we’ll work on a patch for all our other platforms. Missing DLC/Stars - The changes we made to account linking in November did unfortunately cause some issues with some players’ inventories. Reach out to support@innersloth.com if you are experiencing this problem! If you’ve gotten in touch with our support helpdesk, we’ve taken note and are manually granting back DLC if you’ve provided proof of purchase and your Among Us account ID. As this process is manual, it does take some time, so we are forever grateful for your patience! We anticipate smooth sailing for our Friends List update, but if anyone encounters anything strange, please do reach out to Support! Helping you with bugs helps us!
