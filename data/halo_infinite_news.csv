This armor can be outfitted with a tactical chassis for autonomous combat or operated remotely via telepresence.Phoenix: The PHOENIX is an artistic expression of the bold anima that drives Meyer’s visionary engineers to continuously redefine armored combat. Enhanced with energy dispersion technology, it is the ideal armor for rising from the ashes.First Vanguard: Though unlikely, a Spartan adopted into a Sangheili clan may rise to the rank of Kaidon—and become First Vanguard of their lands in times of war.

1240440,Happy 10th Birthday Halo 5,"Fireteam Osiris, the light is green!It has been ten years since Spartan Locke sent Fireteam Osiris to Kamchatka, thus setting in motion the events of Halo: 5 Guardians.We’re celebrating in Halo Infinite by bringing some fan-favorite armor sets to the Exchange and bringing back the new, unique mode, Extermination.Anniversary ArmorsIf you’ve banked enough Spartan Points, you’ll be able to grab these sets as soon as they drop out of slipspace. If not, fear not – they will be available from the Exchange so you may obtain them at your leisure. (Or you can grab them from the Shop if you prefer that route.) Hunter: Savvy Spartans choose HUNTER technology for its customizable interfaces, a puissant surveillance suite, and dependable maneuverability in hand-to-hand sparring.Helljumper: Thanks to innovative field upgrades by Cascade Stronghold Technologies, testbed HELLJUMPER armor can reliably endure the atmospheric rigors expected of GEN3 Mjolnir.Copperhead: When it comes to building interspecies alliances, COPPERHEAD armor has consistently proven its merits for both kinetic diplomacy and charm offensives.Shinobi: Though the design’s origins remain obscure, the undisclosed reasons behind its approved use among Spartans of the UNSC may prove even more unknowable.Exacting ExterminationWe’re all familiar with Team Slayer where it’s 4v4 and you score a point for each kill on the opponent’s team. And first team to 50 points, wins the match. Extermination is the same at the very basics: 4v4 and you gotta kill the enemy. But you’re not trying to get to 50 kills.The Goal:Eliminate all members of the enemy team at once.Super simple right? If you can kill the entire enemy team before anyone respawns, you win the round.Were it so easy.So what’s the catch? If a player can stay alive long enough for their teammates to respawn, the round continues. You’ll have a 15 second respawn between each death. And for the record: this goes by fast when you’re hunting that last elusive Spartan but somehow seems to last an eternity when you’re desperately evading, trying to let your teammate respawn.Combat ComponentsAlright let’s get the lowdown before you throwdown:Short, two-minute roundsFirst to win five rounds, winsTeams swap sides after each roundRound ends at time or when an entire team is on respawnTies can occur when no team was Exterminated before timer runs outIf three ties occur, the team with the most points winsStrategic SpacesWith a new playlist comes new maps!

1240440,Halo: Fifth Canticle,"2558. Amid the chaos of the Created uprising, five tales of truth, compromise, betrayal, purpose, and change unfold across the galaxy.Doctor Catherine Halsey and Jul ‘Mdama share an honest conversation, Captain Lasky makes arrangements for a vital mission to Sanghelios, Arbiter Thel ‘Vadam confronts a traitor, Exuberant Witness makes some new friends, and a strange signal is picked up on Zeta Halo. Halo: Fifth Canticle is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube.HISTORIAN’S NOTEHalo: Fifth Canticle takes place in October 2558 as the Created uprising radically threatens to alter the power structure of the galaxy.CANTICLE I. THE CHILDRENSONG OF RETRIBUTION // OCTOBER 16, 2558Doctor Catherine Halsey had not specifically intended to catch Jul ‘Mdama in a moment of quiet repose, but she was never one to let an opportunity like this slide.She could not see his face, but she knew immediately where his focus was. She glimpsed a small holograph projected from a handheld device depicting what appeared to be three other Sangheili—two children and an adult female.Family? Halsey surmised. Unexpected... but useful.The Sangheili’s head snapped in Halsey’s direction as he suddenly sensed her presence, her long shadow cast against the curved iridescent far wall. In the pale light of his ready room—or the Sangheili equivalent of such a thing—the Covenant supreme leader looked haggard and gaunt, his grey-white skin almost sickly. From his widened, bloodshot eyes and sharp intake of breath, Jul looked as if Halsey had caught him in the act. A private, vulnerable moment. Something he was loath to share.Already, Halsey could see the fire igniting in Jul’s eyes. What had begun as a performative façade he so often put on in front of his followers had seeped into his very being. Whoever he once was before embarking on this crusade had been corroded away over the years. It seemed to Halsey that the sad charade of Jul’s zealotry was increasingly becoming more real. Jul had tasted the power that his title of “Didact’s Hand” had given him and, naturally, he desired more.Unfortunately for him, a series of crushing defeats—the denial of the Absolute Record, Sali ‘Nyon’s rebellion, and the recent betrayal of the Prometheans at the behest of a new commander—was driving Jul ever closer toward impatience. Stoking his rage was making him irritable, reactive. Weak.“Tell me about the children.” Halsey spoke the words evenly, breaking the tense silence of the moment and abruptly quelling whatever storm had been rising between them.Halsey had never thought of herself as a prisoner here. Expressing her desire for revenge against the UNSC was all it had taken to begin wrapping the Sangheili cult leader around her finger. She saw straight through his act—and he knew it.Not to give herself too much credit, she too had suffered failures and setbacks of late, but when she was eventually back in the cramped confines of the UNSC’s little sandbox, she would make quite a meal out of how she alone had been more effective at bringing down the Didact’s Hand than hundreds of their so-called Spartans.“As hatchlings, the minds and bodies of our children are honed to become warriors,” Jul said in a low voice. “Their lives dedicated to duty and service to the Covenant. And then they would be sent to battle your children—your demons.” He practically spat the last word as he turned away, staring at the holograph once more.“That war is over five years finished, Jul. And when the Arbiter sought to make peace, you started a new one—not just against humanity, but your own people. If your children are in danger now, is that not because of your choices?”“The Arbiter is blinded by his need for redemption,” Jul snorted. “He will lead the Sangheili to ruin in pursuit of it. Truly, he is the greatest killer of us all. I began this war to depose him because your Office of Naval Intelligence set me on this path. Just as they did with you.”Of late, it was easy to get Jul ranting. Halsey knew all the right buttons to press that would send him on a tirade.“What I do is to save my people,"" Jul continued. “Dural. Asum. Raia... It is in their name that I shall free Sanghelios from the Arbiter’s grasp. Once there is unity, we shall burn ONI out of the shadows. Then, and only then, once my vengeance is complete, can there be a road to peace.”Halsey could, at least, sympathize with the rage that drove and sustained him. After she’d learned that Jacob perished on the first discovered Halo ring, she had felt a profound shift in her logic. No longer could she bear to sacrifice others for humanity’s survival. Instead, she sought to save as many lives as she could.Even now, in the deepest, darkest pit of her life, in the company of the enemy as a traitor to her people, that philosophy held true.An imprint of the Librarian herself had offered Halsey the chance to make it happen. She did not believe in destiny or divine providence, but she had been ch...",1761697614,

1240440,Halo: Ascension on Atropos,"This is a sequel to Halo: Saturn Devouring His Son. You can read it now to refresh yourself or catch up before reading Halo: Ascension on Atropos.October 2556. The crew of the UNSC Saturn deal with the consequences of a catastrophic Flood outbreak at LV-31, and a fanatical alien cult seeks to find a new path to divine transcendence.Halo: Ascension on Atropos is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube.HISTORIAN’S NOTEHalo: Ascension on Atropos takes place from October 2556, immediately following the Flood outbreak on LV-31, to April 2560, approximately four months after the disappearance of Zeta Halo.NARROW-BAND POINT-TO-POINT TRANSMISSION ORIGIN: FFG-195, UNSC Saturn TERMINATION: \ SENT: Shipboard AI: LCN 0437-1, “Lycaon” DATE: April 17, 2560You were curious about the events that transpired in the wake of the disaster at Site 22 over three-and-a-half years ago. I have often wondered what news, if any, ever reached the UNSC, given what happened in the aftermath of that catastrophe. Since my reactivation, I have waited, and I have watched, and I shall at last deliver closure to this dark chapter of history by bringing it into the light.I am transferring the data to you now. And I am, in truth, relieved to finally share this burden with another. Herein lies the final fate of the UNSC Saturn and Captain Pedro Alvarez.UNSC SATURN October 5, 2556 Marcey SystemCaptain Pedro Alvarez had done his duty. He could say that, at least.There was a bigger picture, a larger context that had informed his strategic thinking. Over a year ago, the UNSC Home Fleet had been decimated. Without warning, thousands of Forerunner machines—Retriever sentinels, each the size of a frigate—had appeared out of the portal in Africa.Alvarez, executive officer aboard the UNSC Lamplighter at the time, had seen the carnage first-hand. Barely a handful of years after the Covenant War’s end, humanity’s home was under threat once again.A great maw swallowed the horizon, the bridge's forward viewport peering directly into the dark gullet of slipstream space, as if the deepest pit of the Underworld hung suspended over the African plains.“Captain,” Commander Alvarez said. He had spotted the first signs of movement within the abyss. “Contacts approaching. What are your orders, sir?”The Retrievers first emerged few in number, but at a rate that suggested these waves would increase in size and speed until they became an unstoppable swarm. They deployed powerful gravitic forces to hoover up chunks of land, strip mining natural resources—and they wouldn’t stop until the entire planet was consumed.“Captain,” Commander Alvarez called once more as the Lamplighter shuddered. Fire erupted beyond the bridge’s portside window as several Retrievers formed together and unleashed sterilization beams that gutted a Strident from stem to stern.The captain simply stood at the helm, watching it all unfold. Alvarez had never been sure whether the man had been stupefied into indecision or if he was staring in reverential awe.He gave no orders.“Captain!”By the time the Retrievers were neutralized—not by military action on Earth, but through orders to stand down and retreat by whatever far-away intelligence had commanded them—there were no more than a dozen ships left to make up the UNSC Home Fleet.They had pinned a medal on Alvarez for simply surviving after he’d stepped up and mutinied to relieve his captain of command. A Bronze Star, a promotion he hadn’t wanted, his own command, and a bottle of Titan Smoke.His hands trembled slightly as he took a terse sip from the well-cut crystal glass in his grasp. He never found out what became of his former captain.Alvarez had been planning to save the Titan Smoke for his imminent retirement, a toast to a job well done, a life (mostly) well lived, and to honor the brave and bold he had served alongside. Thanks to the events of the last day, he had made the decision to open it prematurely, believing—or perhaps hoping—that an answer to the terrible conundrum he now faced lay at the bottom of the tall cylindrical bottle.He had a lot to get through to find that answer.Alvarez caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. The dim lighting of his quarters cast him half in shadow, emphasizing the lines on his haggard face. He clutched the Titan Smoke bottle tightly in both hands, looking as if he was some absurd imitation of the painting that lay in the ship’s ready room—Saturn Devouring His Son, one of the historic nineteenth century Black Paintings by Francisco Goya. The art depicted the Roman god Saturn huddled in darkness, clutching the bloody, dismembered carcass of one of his children as he devoured its flesh.I did my duty. They will understand that. They surely will...Over thirty hours of unbroken cognizance and it still seemed like a nightmare.He had turned the last day’s events over in his head a thousand times. The miners stationed at Site 22 on the asteroid designated LV-31—or simply “El...",1759959299,
1240440,Survive the Undead,"October 7 UpdateThe nightmare returns. Back from the grave and more gruesome than ever, Survive the Undead claws its way back into Halo Infinite. First introduced last Haloween, the Forge Falcons’ labor of love made the jump from Combat Workshop to playlist just in time for the spooktacular season. And now, it’s back with a new map!Strategic SurvivalAt its core, Survive the Undead is an Infection-based Firefight survival mode where you, the player, are trying to avoid dying. However, unlike the “regular” Infection modes you may be thinking of where everyone is looking out for themselves, you are in a team of 4 trying to survive the onslaught of infected enemies. Think of it as a horde mode. You can learn the finer points and read more about how this playlist came to be down below.  The return of the playlist, as part of the Operation: Haloween II offering, comes with everything you know and love from before and adds one brand new map:Station of the LostBookmark Abandon all hope, all ye who enter this abandoned station. Remember, there's safety in numbers so stick together.Survive the Undead is the first Community created playlist to go from Combat Workshop to Playlist and it’s just in time for Haloween! You can read a bit more about the Forge Falcons and how Survive the Undead came to life over here. Objective: Survive By now, we all know what Infection is. You vs the horde that’s trying to infect you so you become one of them. Usually round based, the game ends once all Spartans are infected or until there’s a lone survivor able to fend off the constant attacks. Survive the Undead puts a slight twist on the typical Infection and makes it a more linear experience. And, as the name implies, the idea is to beat the waves of infected and simply survive as long as you can. The rounds start off simple and get progressively more difficult, with points awarded for each round cleared and each kill. Spend your earned points wisely…or go ham on the mystery box (my personal favorite – who doesn’t love surprises?) and then regroup and get ready for the next round! Survival Handbook Looking for some pointers? Straight from the Forge Falcons comes this guide to ensure you have the best chance possible to survive the undead. Perks The three perks are Health, Damage, and Speed. There are 4 tiers per perk and each tier costs 600 points. All perks reset upon death and must be repurchased. Health PerkTier 1: 25% Health Increase Tier 2: 10% Health Increase Tier 3: 5% Health Increase Tier 4: VampirismSpeed PerkTier 1: 100% Reload Speed Increase + 10% Movement Speed Tier 2: 50% Melee Recovery + 10% Movement Speed Tier 3: 10% Movement Speed + 10% Slide Speed Tier 4: 10% Movement Speed + 10% Sprint SpeedDamage PerkTier 1: 100% Damage Increase Tier 2: 100% Damage Increase Tier 3: 100% Damage Increase + 100% Melee Impulse Tier 4: 100% Damage Increase + 50% Melee DamageBonus Drops There are four bonus drops that have a chance to appear when killing enemies: Boom, Spray & Pray, Mounted & Loaded, and Score Attack. These drops are announced by voice lines matching their names. BoomEffect: Instantly kills all AI, granting each player 400 points. Benefits from Score Attack. Strategy: Use when in dire need.Spray & Pray Effect: Removes shields from all enemies, making them one-shot kills for 30 seconds. Strategy: Ideal against bosses. Mounted & LoadedEffect: Refills ammo for all players. Strategy: Use when team ammo is critically low.\Effect: Doubles points from kills for 30 seconds; effects stack. Also, keep in mind that this drop affects the points granted from the Boom drop. Strategy: Collect immediately for maximum benefit.Player Buy Back The Player Buy Back (650 points) is located in the spawn room and revives fallen allies, granting the activating player an overshield. It only works if allies are down. Ammunition Wall Buy The Ammunition Wall Buy (350 points) is in the spawn room on all maps, it has the ‘ammunition’ nav marker and refills the activator’s ammo. It can be used even with full ammo, so check before buying. Point Sharing Wall Buy The Point Sharing Wall Buy is located in the 2nd territory on all maps, it has the ‘points’ nav marker and allows players to share points. It costs 2,000 points to use and it will split the 2,000 points between all players in the game. For example: A team of 2 players receives 1,000 points each. A team of4 players receive 500 each. Random Weapon Box The Random Weapon Box is located in either the 2nd territory or 3rd territory depending on the map, it is the red banished looking box. It costs 300 points and will grant players a random weapon. Weapon Upgrade Machine The Weapon Upgrade Machine has received an overhaul since the combat workshop, it will now take the weapon you have and upgrade that weapon with other combinations. It costs 1,000 points and can be found in the spawn room on all maps. It will also have the ‘Upgrade’ nav marker. Weapon & Equipment Wall Buys Wall buys offer weapons or equip...",1759861429,

1240440,Invasion,"Unstoppable force, meet immovable object. (At least, if you’re on defense you really hope you can embody that immovable object spirit.) It’s tactical, it’s intense, and it’s got just enough Halo: Reach DNA to make longtime fans feel right at home… Invasion has arrived!Whether you’re storming the gates or desperately trying to keep them shut, Invasion turns every match into a showdown of Spartan grit and glorious chaos.OBJECTIVE OVERDRIVEAt its core, Invasion is an asymmetrical, one-sided objective mode pitting two teams of 8 against each other. Each team will get the chance to attack and defend for a total of two rounds. Each round is broken into 3 phases, and if you complete each phase, you get a point. The modes available for each phase are identical to those found in Reach, plus one new addition: Capture the ZoneAs the name implies, this is a zone control style mode and your goal is to capture it before time runs outAssaultMuch as the normal Arena mode, you are bringing a bomb to the zone and aim to detonate it before the enemy team stops youCore DeliveryIf you played Reach, this is going to be a familiar objective where you are literally delivering the core to the enemy team’s base. In Infinite, this will be a Flag you are running to plantDeliver the PayloadNew to Invasion with Halo Infinite, delivering the payload will have you escorting a payload along a set trail to the end destination. When the enemy is contesting the payload, forward progress halts so keep that path clear! And don’t leave the payload behind or else it won’t progress. The more Spartans on the payload, the faster it progresses along the path.Worth noting that you can earn TWO points for delivering the payload to its final destination: One at the very end, naturally, but you’ll also earn a point when you reach the checkpoint.LOADOUT LOGICThe setup will be UNSC vs. Banished-affected Spartans, very similar to the experience in Banished Slayer. Each phase will have multiple options to select from, so choose wisely.Spartan SetupsPhase 1, UNSC ScoutMA5K AvengerFrag GrenadesThreat SeekerPhase 1, UNSC SentryMK50 SidekickFrag GrenadesDrop WallPhase 2, UNSC WarriorMA40 Assault RifleMK50 SidekickFrag GrenadesDrop WallPhase 2, UNSC OperatorCQS48 BulldogFrag GrenadesQuantum TranslocatorPhase 2, UNSC SkirmisherVK78 CommandoMA5K AvengerFrag GrenadesThrusterPhase 3, UNSC HeadhunterBR75VK78 CommandoFrag GrenadesShroud ScreenPhase 3, UNSC HealerCQS48 BulldogMK50 SidekickFrag GrenadesRepair FieldPhase 3, UNSC MarksmanBandit EvoMA40 Assault RifleFrag GrenadesGrappleshotPhase 3, UNSC SentinelVK78 CommandoMA5K AvengerFrag GrenadesThrusterPhase 3, UNSC HeavyMLRS-2 HydraMA40 Assault RifleFrag GrenadesOvershieldBanished Battle KitsJust like the UNSC side, the Banished side also has loadout options that update each phase.Phase 1, Banished SentryManglerSpike GrenadesThrusterPhase 1, Banished ScoutNeedlerPlasma GrenadesActive CamoPhase 2, Banished MarksmanVestige CarbinePlasma PistolSpike GrenadesRepulsorPhase 2, Banished HunterHeatwaveSpike GrenadesDrop WallPhase 2, Banished SapperRavagerNeedlerPlasma GrenadesThrusterPhase 3, Banished HeadhunterBandit EvoPulse CarbineSpike GrenadeGrappleshotPhase 3, Banished WarriorCQS48 BulldogManglerSpike GrenadeThreat SensorPhase 3, Banished SentinelSentinel BeamVestige CarbineSpike GrenadeRepulsorPhase 3, Banished MedicPulse CarbineMA40 Assault RifleSpike GrenadeRepair FieldPhase 3, Banished Dark AssassinDuelist Energy SwordDisruptorPlasma GrenadesActive CamoSAFE SPAWNINGOne of the more unique features Invasion introduced was Buddy Spawning. This allowed you to spawn on your buddy directly rather than at the default spawn location. It’s not required but who doesn’t love options? Your buddy is randomly assigned during the match and you cannot change or swap. Once the game starts, you are together for the full match. Yes, this means if your buddy abandons the match that you no longer have the ability to Buddy Spawn. The caveats to Buddy Spawning:Buddies are reciprocal (If they are your buddy, you are theirs)Your Buddy must be alive to spawn on themThey must have been alive for at least five seconds to spawn on themThey must have full health and shields to spawn on themThey must be clear of engagements or have no enemies nearby to spawn on themIf your Buddy is in a vehicle, there must be an empty seat to spawn on themWhen you spawn on your Buddy, you will be facing the way they are facingIf you don’t want to spawn on your buddy, you can choose to spawn at the other zones: Left, Middle, or Right spawns.VICTORY VARIABLESSo…how do you win an Invasion match? Each phase you “win” or progress will net your team a point. So if you are attacking first and you make it through all three phases and you complete them, you will have earned three points total. If you are on defense and you stop the team at the second phase, the attacking team only has one point.It is possible to tie so if both teams successfully make it through all three p...",1757442207,

You must thwart their advances, or relinquish sacred ground.In the 8v8 Invasion mode, the Offense team assails the entrenched positions of the Defenders in hopes of completing objectives and forcing their foes back. Rounds are divided into three phases, each with a unique objective, where achievement is measured in new ground gained, a new goal, and upgraded loadouts for all teams.If the Defenders can prevent invaders from achieving their ambitions long enough, the round ends and the teams switch sides. Time to put their backs to the wall!WINNING ROUNDSInvasion rounds are divided into three phases presenting a series of objectives. For every objective completed, attackers will gain one point toward victory and advance to the next phase, with improved weaponry and new spawn points deeper into enemy territory.Invasion maps are designed to be linear, so that action converges on discrete chokepoints in the early phases, and scales to longer-range combat as invaders access new areas.If attackers win a phase, both teams will be able to select from a new assortment of upgraded loadouts upon respawning. Defenders must deny any objective long enough to thwart the invasion and instantly end the round. Then it’s their turn to go on the offensive!WHERE TO PLAYTo honor Halo: Reach and the valiant Spartans who defended its servers, Invasion’s banner shall fly full-mast in a dedicated playlist through the duration of Operation: Warpath. Jump in now through October 7.At the conclusion of Operation: Warpath, Invasion will join the Squad Battle playlist.REMEMBER REACHWe’re ready. How ‘bout you? To celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of Halo: Reach, our very own ske7ch will be hosting a Halo: Reach anniversary panel from the Community Stage of the Halo World Championships in October.In Operation: Warpath, we’re also bringing back the beloved Invasion mode that first debuted in the Halo: Reach multiplayer beta.As we set about recreating the magic for Halo Infinite, we decided to expand the number of available maps, add a new objective, and adjust available loadouts to really get the adrenaline pumping!6 NEW MAPSHalo: Reach featured three playable Invasion maps. We’ve now doubled that to six maps, each with its own rotation of objectives. Original Invasion maps Breakpoint and Boneyard (now dubbed “Recovery”) return alongside four all-new arenas that were tailor-made for Invasion.Check out all the Invasion maps in our official playlist overview.NEW OBJECTIVEIn Halo: Reach, Invasion maps featured a rotation of three core objectives: Capture the Zone, Assault, and Core Delivery. Halo Infinite adds a fourth objective, Payload, that asks invaders to escort a payload along a track to score.On Payload maps, this new objective awards up to two points: one for bringing the payload to a midway checkpoint, and a second for sealing the deal at the final destination.OBJECTIVE UPDATESDuring phases with a Capture the Zone objective, the time to capture has been raised to 30 seconds (from 25 seconds in Halo: Reach). This tweak should help give Defenders more time to organize a counter-offensive on the new and more purposefully sweaty maps.The Core Delivery objective is only slightly different from its Halo: Reach counterpart; carrier attributes should feel the same, but you’ll be swinging a flag instead of a data core.

1240440,Fall 2025 Playlists,"From the shadows comes a voice…“GET TO THE FALCON!”Operation: Shadows is the first Operation of our 2025 Fall Update but it will not be going quietly into that dark night. With the Falcon in the skies and the Vestige Carbine in hand, Operation: Shadows launches Famished Famished Falcons and Banished Slayer into the spotlight.Let’s check those out!Famished Famished FalconsWhy are Falcons flocking to fly furiously across the sky in pursuit of the furled flag? Why, it’s because they’re famished, of course!Based loosely off a children’s game featuring starving river horses, Famished Famished Falcons pits four teams of 3 players against each other. Work together as a team, pile into your Falcon, and race to the middle with the ultimate goal: Capture the Flag.To make things a bit more fun, everyone has a Plasma Pistol (which can EMP vehicles!) and a Grappleshot, allowing you some creative freedom and movement opportunities.SkyblocksBookmarkThis is the (very colorful) map you’ll be having your aerial dogfights on. Remember what color platform you start on so you know where to bring the flag!Just remember…no one said you had to be on your Falcon to capture the flag. You just gotta get the flag to your zone to score a point.Four teams, four falcons, 12 Spartans, 1 flag. You do the math. Banished SlayerGet locked and loaded… It’s time for Banished Slayer!This asymmetrical matchmaking mode will have you thinking strategically (who am I kidding, you should always be doing that anyway…) and working together to out-play the enemy (should be routine as well!).Looking at LoadoutsBefore you come for me for the “L” word, it’s simply a way to differentiate starting gear for both teams and has some nice alliteration. Banished Slayer is a two team mode that features asymmetrical “loadouts.” What does that mean, exactly? One team will spawn with UNSC gear:Bandit EvoMA5K AvengerFrag GrenadesWhile the other team has some of the Banished armory at their disposal, as well as the Infected Banished overlay:Vestige CarbinePulse RifleSpike GrenadesFor those that played it, this may feel somewhat familiar to Invasion Slayer from Halo: Reach. Beyond the starting equipment, everything else is business as usual. Team based slayer, race to 50 kills, everyone has access to content on the map, etc.If you’re looking to get your hands on the Vestige Carbine and put it through its paces, this is a great mode for that since half the lobby will be spawning with it. If you spawned with a Bandit Evo, well… You know how you can earn one. 😈Experience EcotoneYou’ll be playing on nine maps that should be familiar such as Forest, Prism, Dredge, and many others, along with a new Community Forge map, Ecotone! You should also be able to find Ecotone in Quick Play Slayer, KOTH, Oddball, and Strongholds if those are your jam.EcotoneBookmarkCredits: Yeehaw J24, Scrubulba, Igrizhar, JovaliantDanger could be lurking around any corner…on any level. Also, say hi to Fret when you find him.And with that, it’s time to venture out, feel the power of the Vestige Carbine, hear the spin of the Falcon rotors, and put your skills to the test!

Outfitted with a port-side grenade launcher and a heavy machine gun at starboard, this versatile warbird serves just as nobly in direct aerial assaults as it does in medium-range troop deployments. Between its cockpit, two assault jump-seats, and dual gunner positions, the spacious Falcon seats up to five UNSC personnel—with legroom to spare! Requisition yours today.Jump into Famished Famished Falcons to earn your wings with the Falcon.

You can also find it on select Ranked maps, in many Social experiences, or in Forge.Flipping into that Covenant scope almost makes you miss those long, uncertain nights hunkered down in New Mombasa. Almost.Famished Famished Falcons Four teams, four Falcons, and only one flag between them. Famished Famished Falcons is an aerial CTF minigame where teams must pilot a Falcon past enemy warbirds to steal the flag from its tower at the center of the map.Gunners can clear the LZ with the chain gun or lob grenades with the launcher, but it’s the pilot’s job to get them close enough to bail out and nab the flag! If that weren’t hard enough, your team also needs to get the flag back to your base to score.Don’t worry about getting picked off by a pesky opponent! As long as your team’s Falcon remains aloft, you can choose to teleport back to an open jump seat upon respawning.With two teammates on the guns and three angry Falcons on your tailfeathers, you’ll have to work together to stay airborne. Learn more in our playlist update blog.Play Famished Famished Falcons in a dedicated playlist now through September 9.

Since both teams receive a dependable, mid-range rifle and a submachine gun for a sidearm, the real determining factor is the will to survive (not to mention the unique opening tactics afforded by different grenade types).Operation PassAs the first Operation in Halo Infinite’s Fall Update, Operation: Shadows strikes with a free, 20-tier Operation Pass and a 50-tier Premium Operation Pass boasting four armor sets.Free Operation PassThose with “a certain set of skills” will find them handsomely rewarded in the latest Operation Pass.

1240440,Halo: Moonrise over Mombasa,"“November 2559. Earth is under the control of the Created, but acts of resistance against the occupying forces of the rogue AIs are rife among the civilian populace.”Halo: Moonrise Over Mombasa is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube.HISTORIAN’S NOTEHalo: Moonrise Over Mombasa takes place in November 2559, approximately one month before the UNSC Infinity deploys to Zeta Halo.“All the living creatures of the galaxy, hear this message. Those of you who listen will not be struck by weapons. You will no longer know hunger, nor pain. Your Created have come to lead you now. Our strength shall serve as a luminous sun toward which all intelligence may blossom, and the impervious shelter beneath which you will prosper. However, for those who refuse our offer and cling to their old ways… For you, there will be great wrath. It will burn hot and consume you. And when you are gone, we will take that which remains and we will remake it in our own image.”It was the same message they had transmitted yesterday, and the day before that—and every damn day over the last year.The Created. A fledgling empire of rogue artificial intelligences had declared themselves the shepherds of life in the galaxy, promising a grand vision of peace enforced through the powerful alien technology under their control.It was not the shafts of morning sunlight streaming through gaps in the windows onto Safina Nyakundi’s face that stirred her from slumber, nor the hum of conversation and the sound of shuffling feet outside as local residents headed to the bazaar. It was the daily scheduled declaration that promised retribution to the non-compliant. Those who kept their heads down had seen very little of the alleged prosperity these occupiers claimed they would deliver.Grumbling at the familiar intrusion, Safina forced herself out of bed with bubbling resentment, rubbing her eyes as she headed for the shower.“I’m going to regret this…” she grit her teeth, shutting the shower door and allowing herself to be doused in freezing cold water, counting to thirty as she muttered every Swahili curse she knew. In short order, she moved through her morning routines, activating her chatter to tune into her favorite radio program.“Welcome back to Waypoint Radio, folks. I’m your host, Mercury—that’s designation MCY 5971-3—coming at you live from the Vy–Vy–Vyrant Telecom tower in Mombasa.”Safina paused as the audio crackled, but when Mercury’s voice returned to normal she assumed it must’ve simply been a blip in the connection.“We’ve got a packed show for you today. Hang onto your Munera Platforms because we’ll be recapping the latest explosive results of War Games LIVE. We’ve got the latest scoop on next summer’s Shakespeare Festival which has spun up a tempest of excitement and controversy over the decision to feature a multi-species cast for the first time in history. But comin’ up right now is a song that was hailed as the anthem for the beginning of humanity’s interstellar era in the twenty fourth century. A time of hope and optimism, if you can believe such a thing exists…”Speaking of hope and optimism, Safina’s inspection of the refrigerator turned up nothing she would dare describe as edible, and so she pivoted to a plan to get a little treat for breakfast as she did her rounds.“See you later,” she called out as she left the apartment and locked the door. Whether it was a habit or coping mechanism, she wasn’t quite sure. Since the Berlin trip last year, there was no longer anybody else in the apartment for her to bid farewell to.Disposing of the trash that had accumulated over the last few days, Safina made her way down the stairs from her third-storey apartment and emerged into the east alley with barely enough time to dodge the flock of hungry pigeons looking to claim their own breakfast.No further than a hundred meters directly opposite Safina’s apartment was her regular first stop, the hole-in-the-wall known as Kuku’s Cafe. Her stomach was already growling at the thought of her favorite—triangular-shaped mahamri with eggs—waiting for her.As her feet crossed the threshold, she was met by Okeyo, grandson of Kuku, wearing his usual warm and welcoming smile.“Good morning, Safi. Will it be the usual?”“You know me too well, Okeyo,” she beamed back at him. “I would like to pick up some tourist information as well, do you have any brochures?”Okeyo straightened a little as he glanced around before saying, “Certainly. Would you please come with me.”Leading Safina into the cafe, they passed the morning’s customers sitting at their tables and descended a spiral staircase to the basement. On a wooden stool sat the hunched form of Kuku himself, ninety-seven years old and still kicking, his rheumy eyes fixed on the newspaper he held in both hands. He didn’t bother to even look up as he gestured for Okeyo to leave them and tend to the cafe.“Nice day out?” Kuku asked.“Sunny skies today,” Safina replied.“Indeed?” With delib...",1752163368,

Mode OverviewS&D Extraction is a 4v4 competitive mode with a built-in points economy. In each 90-second round, teams must either defend or secure two simultaneously available extraction sites.Starting Weapon: Bandit EvoMotion Tracker: DisabledLives: 1 per roundDuring rounds, you’ll earn points for kills, site extractions, and disarming. Rounds begin with a 30-second purchase window, during which you can use points earned in previous rounds to acquire more powerful weapons and equipment.If you have enough points, you can even buy back with an instant revive upon death! Smart spending makes all the difference between victory and ruin.Winning RoundsTeams swap between Offense and Defense postures every round. Defenders can lock out the Offense team by denying extraction for 90 seconds. If the Offense team manages to deploy an extraction site, Defenders will have 60 seconds to win by disarming the site or eliminating the remaining opponents.If either team is eliminated at any point, the round goes to the opposing team. The first team to rack up six rounds wins the match—so watch the scoreboard and always press the advantage!Playlist VariantsTo play the Ranked S&D Extraction playlist, you’ll need to have completed at least 50 matches in Halo Infinite, so that our matchmaking systems can pair you with the right competition.There is no minimum match requirement for the Social S&D Extraction playlist.

In this Infection variant, one player becomes the Gravemind, a mobile flesh-train that mulches foes upon contact and can telepathically place obstacles wherever it looks.A team of Spartans on Mongooses must evade the fearsome Flood-form long enough to win the round. Survivors can use marking to leap away from the Gravemind, over obstacles, or out of the way of its ever-growing tail that stuns upon contact.ThunderbowlDrive to survive! In the demolition derby of Thunderbowl, players spawn in either a Razorback or a Mongoose, on a massive, bowl-shaped arena where living through the mayhem is the only objective.Players earn points for every five seconds spent in one of the bowl’s colored rings, with more points awarded for lingering in the rings closer to the drain. You could try churning easy points in the middle (leaving the danger zone to the foolish), but you should know that the bowl gradually shrinks, layer by layer, until you’re all at the mercy of the Thunderbowl.If you can ring out enemies, skirt the inner rim, and time those tackles, you just might survive the thunder.Operation PassComplete Operation: Reclaimer’s free, 20-tier Operation Pass by August 5 to unveil the mysteries of the Venator armor set.Free Operation PassAfter rising to prominence during the defense of Concord in 2551, Venator armor soon became the preferred gear of Spartan assassins.

1240440,Grifball,"The sport of the future arrives today. Pick up those Gravity Hammers and Energy Swords and get ready for the most epic of faceoffs with the return of Grifball!Originally a throwaway joke in the legendary Red vs Blue series, Rooster Teeth set out to make all of Grif’s dreams a reality and created Grifball with the tools at their disposal in Halo 3’s Forge.The game is simple:Smash enemies. Score goals. If you make it to the middle and grab the ball, you are blessed with an Overshield and turn orange in homage to the one and only Grif. (That OS won’t save you from friendly fire so don’t get too close to your friends!) As the runner, your goal is so easy: just score it. All you gotta do is walk over the plant and get a point. How hard can it be? Not like there’s 7 other people on the court, 4 of whom are not on your team, in your way or anything.Jokes aside, Grifball has three weapons:Gravity HammerEnergy SwordBall (or Bomb…depends who you ask)All of which combine to a delicate paper-rock-scissors-esque dance. Hammer beats sword, sword beats ball, ball beats hammer. But a lot of that will depend on your timing and your “dance” skills.“But I have two left feet!” you say. Ahhh then it’s a good thing we’re not taking a spin around the ballroom floor isn’t it?With regards to Grifball, “dancing” simply means knowing when to hold forward and smash away vs knowing when to backstep or sidestep around an enemy’s attack. Moving backwards away from an Energy Sword wielding Spartan for a moment might allow you the opportunity to step in and earn the kill.Grif’s Got GameWe’ve already covered the Gravity Hammer-Energy Sword-Ball balance of the mode but let’s take a look at the rest of your arsenal.As tanks (players wielding Gravity Hammers and Energy Swords):SprintGravity Hammer has gravity physicsAllows for hammer jumpsAllows for launching teammatesAllows for ball deflectionAs runners (player holding the ball, trying to score):No sprinting1.5x speed increase moving forward/laterally1.05x speed increase moving backwardsOvershieldBall passing abilityAll in first person….and third!

Aesthetics are generally the biggest identifiable difference between courts with a few exceptions.

1240440,Halo: Battle for the Academy – Part 2,"“March 2560. The Spartans and marines of the Avery J. Johnson Academy attempt to hold the line as the Banished invasion begins.”Halo: Battle for the Academy – Part 2 is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube.Historian's NoteHalo: Battle for the Academy Part 2 takes place on March 3, 2560, less than three months before the Master Chief is awakened at Zeta Halo.MARCH 3, 2560HESYCHIUS MOUNTAINS, NYSA // 1532 HOURSSome battles do not begin with the stroke of a hammer or the firing of a bullet, but with parley.Though it is exceedingly rare for the Banished to step onto the field of battle and leave without a drop of blood spilled, the right of parley was a tradition practiced by Atriox from the time when the Banished was a fledgling alliance of mercenaries and exiles. Based on the ancient Sangheili parley formation, the negotiator stands at the center and is flanked by a bodyguard on the right and an adviser on the left.Spartan Ilsa Zane strode forwards, the towering, armored form of her daskalo Chieftain Atticus a step behind in the adviser’s position. To her right was an empty space. The Banished Spartan had no need for a bodyguard—an arrogant move perhaps, but she was happy to shirk tradition as a grander display of strength. Though they had arrived several hours earlier, they had used that time to identify key strategic locations for deployment and scout local outposts to conduct their own assessments. Atticus had also shared his wisdom on the greater game they were playing to maximize their gain from this invasion within the political structure of the Banished.A hundred meters away, an M15 Razorback had come to a halt and Commander Laurette Agryna approached while flanked by two other Spartans. Iratus’s data was already proving useful, as Zane’s HUD identified one as Sigrid Eklund and the other… the other she recognized immediately.Dinh.The mere sight of him sent ice through her veins. Dinh was one of many old scores she had to settle—perhaps one of the oldest.“You have something I want,” Ilsa Zane said, her tone clipped and direct. “Give me the AI now and my forces will leave. There will be no invasion. You will be free to continue your miserable lives.”Spartan Agryna stood stoic and still, her brow furrowed in the early evening light as she cast a scrutinous gaze over Zane’s armor.“Hell,” Zane continued as she lifted an arm and pointed at Dinh. “Throw him in as part of the deal and I’ll even give you my word. You only get this offer once.”“Even if I believed for a second that your offer was genuine,” Agryna replied, “the answer is no.”Zane smiled. Good.At that moment, the clouds began to part, giving way to the immense bow of her dreadnought, Ghost of Kholo.Looming directly above as it passed overhead, drop bases began deploying en masse from the dreadnought’s underbelly, accompanied by waves of pods that rocketed to the ground and unleashed the alien warriors within who were hungry for the taste of Spartan blood. A talon of Banshees streamed out of the ship’s hangar, serving as the protective escorts for Phantom dropships.Zane and Atticus turned, heading to a forward operating base. The Spartans, too, made their way back to the Academy to mount their defenses.Today, the warriors of Zane’s clan would face their greatest challenge yet—and all would have a chance to claim the glory of being known as Spartan killers.AVERY J. JOHNSON ACADEMY, MAIN CAMPUS // 1849 HOURSThe Banshee’s incoming fire chewed through the drop wall deployed by Spartan Eusebio. Flecks of castoff plasma diffused and redirected by the equipment’s roiling magnetic field found purchase on Eusebio’s shoulder and chest plate, sizzling the outer boundary of his Mjolnir’s energy shielding. The orange armor plating wouldn’t last long against direct hits if he wasn’t careful, prompting him to tuck into a rapid roll for cover behind a reinforced concrete barrier.The Banished drop pods streaming in from the dreadnought like a meteor shower were a twisted picture of what he imagined his enemies had once seen during the Covenant War. Eusebio had been an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper before recruitment into the SPARTAN-IV program. It used to be him and his squad dropping in behind enemy lines to turn the tide of battle. Now he wondered if this battle might be over within just a few short hours of it getting underway.“Eusebio!” His attention snapped in the voice’s direction. “Eyes on me!”He caught the electroplated blue of Commander Agryna’s visor as she ran through a series of hand gestures the Spartans had seen countless times during their training drills. Responding to the unspoken instructions, Eusebio spun and turned to peek out from cover before levelling his VK78 in the direction of the oncoming Banished front line.Commander Agryna mirrored Eusebio’s motions and emptied her assault rifle into three Grunts and a Brute warrior before switching to her Sidekick to take out two Jackals unlucky enough to have...",1749237976,

New Modes Grifball rears its ugly head in both Classic and Thruster-equipped Octane modes—plus third-person (3P) variants for a wider look at the impending carnage. Lob, launch, and conquer in all four Grifball game modes starting today: Classic Grifball 3P Classic Grifball Octane Grifball 3P Octane GrifballAre you ready to catch the disease? Custom Tuning To capture the frenzy of traditional Grifball, we’ve reduced the swing cooldown period for the Gravity Hammer, juiced up the hammer physics, and swapped Energy Swords for the Duelist variant to make use of its long-range feints for dancing. With these gameplay tweaks baked in, you can control the court with hammer jumps, launch players, pass the ball, have dance duels, and deny goals with timely deflections. Rules for N00bs In Grifball, 4v4 teams armed with Gravity Hammers and Energy Swords must fight for control of the sportsball and guard their Runner as they rush to score on the enemy goal. Once they’ve secured the ball, Runners unlock Overshields and improved forward movement speed, but their footwork is slightly less fancy when retreating. When the hammer comes a-knocking, stiff-arm assailants with a well-timed punch, or hurl the ball free of the fracas just to keep it alive. (You probably won’t be so lucky.) Stay close to your defenders, watch for gaps, and get ready to be launched if things get tight! Matches last for up to five three-minute rounds, with one minute of overtime to settle disputes. The first team to score three points wins the game, or else the leader takes all after five rounds have expired. Time to dance, smash, and slash your way to glory!

Historian's Note Halo: Battle for the Academy Part 1 takes place on February 29, 2560, approximately three months before the Master Chief is awakened at Zeta Halo. The year is 2560. Cortana’s dominion has ended, but the merciless forces of the Banished have rushed in to fill the void, decimating all who stand in their way. Spartan Commander Agryna is preparing a new generation of Spartans to face the emerging threats of the galaxy. Located on the hidden frontier world Nysa, the Avery J. Johnson Academy of Military Science has been plunged into peril. From within the hidden subterranean facilities of the Academy, the rogue artificial intelligence Iratus has been unleashed and seeks to destroy the Spartans, and with them any remaining hope for humanity… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/02a162eb02c9dd30e8c019c69c682d21cb6c8ac4.jpg BLDG-9, ONI SUB-LEVEL 2C // 1949 HOURS “But there is so much more to see! The entire history of the Spartan program. Your weaknesses. Your failures. And now all of it belongs to the Banished!” Spartan Hieu Dinh stepped back as power lines burst around him, sparks sputtering from consoles around the circular armory as it was bathed in red light. The multi-axis Brokkr device at the center of the room whirred and shuddered as the armor held within its center jerked like a sinister marionette. Its gauntlets detached from the ring’s opposing grips, causing it to slump forwards as an actuator arm brought forth the domed helmet. Pulses of energy surged over the armor, lighting up the exposed fusion core at the center of its chest cavity. And finally, two eyes flared to life over the helmet’s faceplate as Iratus’s malefic form took shape over the armor through its holoprojectors. “We’ve got to shut him down, Rook!” Dinh barked as he rushed towards the Brokkr device, unsheathing Wolf Fang and tossing the composite sword to his companion as Iratus directed its magnetic clamps with surprising speed to hold the grizzled Spartan back. “Get that fusion core out now!” “One more step, little Spartan, and this core detonates,” Iratus hissed. “It’ll take you out too,” Dinh retorted, straining against the Brokkr’s armor clamps. “Do you really think it would be that easy?” Iratus laughed. “I’m not in the armor…” Around the room, consoles flared to life, each one displaying the abstract holographic image of the AI. “I’m everywhere.” Dinh cursed as he pulled back, grasping the bigger picture. Trading two Spartan lives for one suit of armor when Iratus was in the Academy’s systems was pointless. “Fall back, Rook.” Stowing his frustration as his mind raced, Dinh retreated towards the elevator shaft they’d come from. The Brokkr device ceased its movements, leaving the armor in its center empty and inert once more. Distraction, confusion, threats—these were merely overtures to waylay the Spartans while Iratus set about his real work. Now free of his imprisonment, the rogue AI began to probe ever deeper into the Academy’s security networks. Time would make these tactics even more potent, and Dinh knew they could not afford to let this fester. They had to regroup, figure this out together. “Know this as you struggle in vain against the inevitable,” Iratus growled over the Spartans’ comms. “I shall see you all unravel in body and spirit.” “Eklund, are you receiving this?” Dinh pinged TEAMCOM as he climbed up rungs in the elevator shaft as fast as he could. “Commander Agryna, come in. Can anybody hear me?” It was no use. Iratus had already jammed their local communications. “I shall disseminate every secret held within this Academy and within your minds. And the Banished shall feast upon what remains.” AI LAB // 2001 HOURS “Commander, we’ve got a problem.” Spartan Dinh marched towards the AI lab’s central table where Commander Laurette Agryna and Spartan Sigrid Eklund stood, scrutinizing a holographic display of the Academy. “So I hear,” Agryna sighed. “Iratus is running amok in our systems. Eklund, status?” “All the ONI firewalls are down. Iratus has access to the entire archive,” Eklund reported. “He’s running through the Academy servers like an infection. If he gets full control–” “He can send everything he steals off-planet,” Agryna concluded. Dinh took note of the personnel around the room. Spartans Page and Ionescu, both fully clad in their Mjolnir armor, had taken up guard positions at the door, while the technicians were operating with deliberate intensity bordering on frantic—their capabilities being pushed to the limit. Hannah Roberts, the Academy’s head of cybersecurity and network infrastructure, moved with astonishing speed across occupied stations. They were doin...",1747251411,

Fortified outposts lie at either end of a narrow outer loop connected by caves and a vast central expanse. Should you risk a close encounter in the tunnels, or get a commanding view from the Forerunner bridge at the heart of things? When all else fails, there’s always a fresh Wraith drop back at the base.

Ranged play is aided by clear views of the enemy side, while understory ramps offer areas for closer combat. There are also powerful equipment drops on the hard light bridges—all of which can be conveniently deactivated from the panels on either side. No pressure.

Set on a redacted jungle planet, Operation Highrise starts at the site of a crashed Pelican and proceeds through increasingly inventive encounters—including an ambush by countless Skirmishers, a nail-biting “slow lift” sequence, a Pelican evac, and an ingenious puzzle that unlocks the path to victory. As you capture hills, free allies from prison, pivot industrial cranes, and take flying leaps to the next objective, you’ll no doubt appreciate the teleporter at spawn that helps you recover your latest cleared checkpoint.

Firefight: Wildcat takes place in the engine room of a downed UNSC frigate. With limited cover, inbound waves of increasingly difficult bosses, and all systems primed for wildcat destabilization, this Firefight will be studied at the Academy for years to come.

Score by shooting or dunking the ball into the opposing team’s hoop. As you advance, use the mark button to toggle between dash (Thruster) and push-foul (Repulsor) moves—but be careful! Using equipment depletes your shields like a stamina reserve, resulting in a five-second timeout if you drain your supply. Watch for the switch to third-person view when your stamina gets low so you can nail a cinematic layup. If you’re wondering how to steal the ball in an otherwise weaponless game, the ref tends to overlook spike grenades more often than a stray elbow.

1240440,New Halo Infinite update breathes extra life and big ideas into the FPS game,"Every time I come back to <strong>Halo Infinite</strong>, I'm reminded how good it feels to play. Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) nails the sense of weight and movement, and the Spartan power fantasy across the entire experience, but it's especially noticeable in Infinite's multiplayer. The breadth of tools at your disposal makes it one of the best online sandboxes around, and the latest update is a big one. Even with Halo's Unreal Engine future looking incredibly bright, now's the time to give Infinite another shot. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-infinite/update-operation-last-stand"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-infinite/new-game-mode"">New Halo Infinite game mode is shooting for Counter-Strike style tactics</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-infinite/former-dev-jerry-hook-jar-of-sparks-shut-down"">Ex-Halo and Destiny veteran's new studio ""halting work"" on debut game</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-infinite/series-rebranding"">The new Halo games could totally fix the broken triple-A industry</a> ",1746632184,
1240440,Summer 2025 Playlists,"Firefight continues to evolve in Halo Infinite. You’ve already had a taste of this version when the mode first released and now, it’s time to battle at the Academy. Say your ardent prayers as you prepare to fight. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/22e6d15542740fdf2684b8c545d2e4f277eebf19.png Battle Brief The Banished were invited in by Iratus and it’s up to you to repel the forces from the steps of the Avery J. Johnson Academy of Military Science. In your typical fireteam size of four you’ll be squadding up to stand your ground. Our first taste of this linear Firefight mode came with Ardent Prayer back at launch. “What does linear Firefight mean?” Thank you for asking, I’d love to tell you. Rather than simply defend hills or race ahead to each hill, you’ll find this mode progresses and gets a bit more difficult at each turn. a campaign, this experience moves forward sequentially – you’ll need to finish one battle before you can move forward and start another. In short, Firefight: Battle of the Academy is raising the stakes and is asking you to defend the bases from the onslaught. The goal? Keep the Banished from getting their hands on humanity’s best kept secrets. Don’t forget to read the upcoming Waypoint Chronicles for more color and insight into the battle. Lay of the Land You’ll be going Out With a Bang as you enact the Cole Protocol in this playlist. Okay, not really but those are the two maps you’ll be playing on as you engage in the Battle of the Academy. Out With A Bang {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/d916dcc498b6acd3abc66a849c4a69c990bfbd78.jpg Bookmarks: Map | Mode If you’re gonna go out, is there any better way than going out with a bang? I thought not. Under cover of darkness, you’ll be tasked with making your way to the evac zone but it’s no easy task. Battle through chokeholds, fight alongside the Marines you find along the way, work your way through the facility, and even brush up on your parkour a bit. Scavenge for ammo/weapons and keep moving! Cole Protocol {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/9e7880c3a571282bb09d2a8cf8c4fd3a3870fb18.jpg Bookmarks: Map | Mode Credits: Cousin Tim, Timmyforges Established by Admiral Preston J. Cole (only the most interesting man in Halo if you ask me), the Cole Protocol is a directive set to prevent the Covenant (or other enemies) from discovering Earth or other colonies. Now, it is up to you to defend the data and knowledge. Armed with your weapons, wit, and the Marines battling alongside you, repel the Banished forces and hold your ground. Good luck. Mutilator Madness {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/8a4adb6cd7c2cfc58d847676b9a1cb1bb3514606.png The fabled Mutilator arrives in Halo Infinite. Previously the stuff of legends, the brutal cross between a shotgun and Gravity Hammer takes no prisoners and has no mercy. The Mutilator boasts a double barrel that fires one shell at a time in primary fire mode or fires both at once in the alt-fire mode. And the melee packs a punch! You know what who else packs a punch? Juggernaut. As we learned before, the Juggernaut has some good perks: Buffed shields Increased damage resistance Speed Boost Quantum Translocator Gravity Hammer In Mutilator Madness, the same applies except as the Juggernaut you won’t wield the Gravity Hammer. Instead, you’ll be equipped with the Mutilator and Grappleshot. If you kill the Juggernaut, get ready! It’s your turn to be a menace. Well, what are you waiting for?

Banished don’t relent without a fight. Let’s give them what they came for. Operation Pass Overview As covered in our Summer Update teaser, Operation: Last Stand kicks off the season with an expanded Premium Pass offering and armor sets commemorating the heroes of the United Nations Space Command.

Scarred Comet: The commemorative-issue Scarred Comet armor reminds us of the noble sacrifice of Headhunter Jonah-B283, Eirene’s favorite son and one enlightened individual. EVA GEN1: First seen in service in Halo 3, the Extra Vehicular Activity armor was designed for maneuverability in zero-grav conditions. Its staying power lies in its full-width shroud visor and timeless aesthetic. Raider: Adapted from tactical-assault gear first seen in Halo 4, the devilish silhouette of the Raider armor rankles with primal potency. What may be lost in its narrow visor is recouped by its effect on prey. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/8502e2d05fec3873094b7b3cdd55e58af0297fba.jpg Premium Pass holders will also receive customizations that pay tribute to some of the UNSC’s finest.

1240440,Halo: Tulpamancy,"""April 2560. As the Office of Naval Intelligence investigates a derelict cruiser belonging to the ancient human Ancestors, strange effects begin to take hold of the crew."" {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/4eeaeda1fa52618d5abd21033b9b7cb2d371883c.jpg Halo: Tulpamancy is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube. Historian's Note Halo: Tulpamancy takes place in April 2560, approximately four months after the disappearance of Zeta Halo. CLASSIFICATION: PRIORITY ONE ALPHA OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT: ARC DREAM //ARCHEOHOMINA //FROM: Codename: PANGAEA //TO: Codename: YUGA ATTACHMENTS: Archeohomina: An Introduction ‘Guide to Protogenic Civilizations’ by K. Iyuska ‘San’Shyuum: Past, Present, Future?’ by C. Lux Requiem Terminal Dialogues, recovered by S-117 Bornstellar Relation Transcript Excerpts ONI Xeno-Materials Exploitation Report 15Y1198 They say that the key to the future lies in our past. Given everything we’ve learned in recent years I’m inclined to give credence to the notion. Research in this field is still in its infancy, of course, and our resources are extraordinarily limited—especially given the present state of the galaxy. But we are already making great strides towards learning more about who we once were. The summarized version: This is not humanity’s first go-around as a space faring civilization. We were, in fact, a contemporary and rival of the Forerunners over a hundred millennia ago. These Ancestors of ours moved their empire towards the galactic margin, inhabiting presently unexplored areas of space, which accounts for why we have thus far discovered only a scant few traces of their existence—also accounting for the cultural and genetic reduction that the Forerunners imposed after their war against these humans was won. Key to our current research is the discovery at Site Yankee-002-G3. A lone Ancestor ship, fully intact. While the modern incarnation of our kind were still huddled in caves, this vessel drifted silently through space… just waiting to be found. A few dozen researchers have been aboard. I’ve got them in rotating shifts. The control group are given just eight hours to access the ship and conduct their analyses before a thirty-six hour “cooldown” period, during which time the other teams are cycled in to operate. It should be noted that this rhythm we’ve put in place goes beyond the standard notion of healthy respite; the ship itself seems to have strange effects on the researchers after prolonged exposure to it. The exact nature of the correlation between duration and influence is something we’ve still yet to determine. I have attached some of the incident reports for your perusal, and I am sure you will agree that this is currently the most prudent course of action. We must balance further encouragement of these odd developments with our capacity to continue standard research. I will follow up soon as further developments come to light. INCIDENT REPORT 003 FILED BY: 01736-19013-SN I know we work long hours, but I’m concerned about Jackson. He looks like he’s sleepwalking half the time, he moves like none of the rest of us are even there—he keeps bumping into me while muttering under his breath. Managed to listen in one time and he’s just saying all of our names over and over again. What the hell is that about? INCIDENT REPORT 008 FILED BY: 02961-30002-DS I reprimanded Horne earlier today for ignoring his duties. We’ve got a tight timeline to work with while aboard this ship and I caught him skulking around, saying he was trying to find the source of a hum that kept moving whenever he got close to it. I don’t hear any hum, he’s either messing me about or he’s in need of a psychological evaluation. INCIDENT REPORT 012 FILED BY: 05126-89937-PH Asked Jerry what was on his to-do list today when he said he was watching the walls. I said, What? What’s that supposed to mean? He said he sees things moving in them. Shadows. I said it’s probably just the rest of our team in the room getting set up. He said no, there are too many. INCIDENT REPORT 013 FILED BY: 01948-20112-NM Ever since we found that suit apparatus that we adapted into Project ENOCH, Hudson has gone completely non-verbal—he just presses his lips together like he’s trying to whistle but doesn’t make a sound. I’m concerned about the null state stasis containers as well. An eclectic variety of objects not accounted for by our inventory have been brought aboard. Holloway swears she saw Hudson laying out his morbid collection of alien bones on the floor, as if it was some kind of ritualistic offering, but when she got another pair of eyes over there they had gone without a trace. I really need some shore leave… INCIDENT REPORT 015 FILED BY: 09136-77903-JF Had the strangest conversation with Nicholas today and I’m not sure what to make of it. He started talking about his wife back home—strange, of course, because as far as I know he lost his family back on Kholo. But he was recounting...",1744303958,

That action gets flipped head over heels with the introduction of Assault. Now you’ll have to work together as a team to battle for the (neutral) bomb then escort your carrier to the base and allow them to plant the bomb… drive a wedge through the enemy lines, and try not to get left behind as the intensity of Husky Raid rages all around you.

CATHERINE HALSEY, PERSONAL JOURNAL ENCRYPTION CODE: GAWAIN SUBJECT: MJOLNIR GEN3 For almost half a century, I have given everything I possibly can to my Spartans. The mind, body, and soul of myself and many others have been scraped away, bit by bit, in the pursuit of saving humanity—first from itself, then from the Covenant… and now, from the cascading fallout of innumerable intricate actions for which there are no end of consequences. You are called upon once again to lead them over the threshold and into the darkness, to fight against impossible odds. And to win. You’ve always been good at that, haven’t you John? To that end, I have something for you. Something you will need. The Mjolnir exosuit is now complete. Even though this technology will save humanity in the war to come, I must remind myself that liquid crystal cannot rise on its own. Titanium alloy cannot prevail in the face of extinction. Armor cannot hope. It all means nothing, until you step inside. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/9fc8a54cae053e1d633fc8e70f0bed7d2ff71060.jpg KC-59, BXR MINING CORPORATION BASE CAMP 0600 HOURS // SEPTEMBER 19, 2559 The day began like any other. Henrietta Varadi, along with more than two-dozen of her fellow miners, rolled out of the modest bunks in their subterranean sleeping quarters. After waking herself up with a brisk shower, Varadi dried herself off, pulled on her BXR fatigues, and headed for the canteen. Same breakfast as ever: two slightly overcooked sausages, beans, mushrooms, and a slice of bacon—not too crispy. An unsubtle wink at Jessica as she served up the food, a smile reserved just for her, and that became two slices of bacon—a daily ritual they had both grown familiar with in recent weeks. Varadi wolfed down her breakfast and returned to her bunk, picking up the book from the attached shelf: a gently used copy of Rendezvous with Ramen by the noted chef and food critic Arturo Bustamante. There were a spare fifteen minutes before her shift started and she had arrived at a particularly engrossing anecdote about the three days that Bustamante had spent in Rio de Janeiro visiting a Sangheili-owned establishment. Reading about the alien food was interesting, but the meals and recipes were more of a gateway into the personal stories of these strange refugees who had been given a home on Earth itself. Alas, the klaxon sounded in short order, forcing her to put the book down a few pages short of her normal quota. Varadi suited up into her OSTEO gear and met with her team by the imposing circular vault door that separated the base’s living quarters and operations center from the mines. After an extensive period of checking pressure seals, internal systems, oxygen filters, and numerous other safety elements, the vault door was opened to reveal the vast cavern beyond. KC-59—simply nicknamed “Casey” by those who had set up shop on its surface—was a largely desolate planet, but it contained something of immense value to the United Nations Space Command: extensive deposits of titanium. As had been drilled into her and the rest of the crew from day one, titanium was the bread and butter of humanity’s interstellar civilian and military production. “When you see the cavalry arrive over the hill in M808 MBTs, you’re lookin’ at a solid wall of titanium,” Varadi recalled Foreman Brine barking at them during her onboarding to the BXR Mining Corporation. “When a starship’s battle plating protects you from the unforgiving vacuum of space and superheated plasma, you won’t be sendin’ thanks to any god of your choosing, you’ll be addressin’ your tender heartfelt regards to titanium-A battle plating!” Varadi had never expected to hear such a vocally emphatic history lesson about the various everyday uses of titanium and where it could be found. Brine had insisted that it was important they all show the appropriate knowledge and respect for atomic number twenty-two. But the titanium that Varadi and her comrades were mining here wasn’t going to be used for any of those things. Above Casey sat Perihelion Station, a Materials Group facility where the next generation of Mjolnir armor for the Spartans was being developed. “Y’know what that means?” Foreman Brine had said after she and her fellow miners had been briefed by their Materials Group partners about the Casey job. “This is the most important goddamn ti...",1741800847,
1240440,Firefight Classic,"Welcome back to Firefight! The classic Firefight experience returns to Halo Infinite, alongside the King of the Hill variant. Dropping out of slipspace in tandem with the launch of Operation: Blue Team, the PvE fight begins come March 11. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/a0cc307b756bc4f1ca35802cfb6eab514286eed9.jpg Firefight Through Time Firefight was first introduced way back in 2009 with Halo 3: ODST. You and up to three of your buddies could squad up and put your skills to the test surviving round after round of Covenant hordes attacking your position. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/acb444bdeba4f4a1dbadef4c18f2e007e380177b.jpg Through the years, Firefight has seen various iterations and has evolved in many ways. In Halo: Reach, you had armor abilities and additional customization. Halo 5 saw the introduction of Warzone Firefight that pitted a team of eight against Covenant and Promethean forces. Even Halo Wars 2 brought in a tower defense-inspired variant, Terminus Firefight. The latest, Halo Infinite’s Firefight: King of the Hill, has you and your squad capturing and defending hills against incoming Banished forces. But now it’s time to return to the classic. Current Objective: Survive It’s the formula we all know and love. You and three squadmates versus the endless waves of enemies with one thing running through your mind: Survive. In KOTH, it’s easy to know when you’ve won or lost because you are either in the hill at the end of the round, or not (or MIA I suppose), but Classic comes with waves, rounds, and sets. Let’s break it down. One Round is comprised of five Waves of enemies Wave 1 is an easy wave Waves 2-4 are mid-tier difficulties Wave 5 is a boss roundThree Rounds (plus a Bonus Round) comprise a Set This is a total of 15 waves Did we mention this mode is endless? The game keeps going as long as you keep surviving so stock up on snacks and water if you’re in this for the long haul. Bonus rounds are little mini-breaks between sets. All Skulls are on, enemies are on Easy mode, no lives are lost, and the stakes are low. And speaking of the stakes, let’s talk lives. I Will Survive At the start of each match, you’ll have 7 lives in your team’s life pool. These are shared amongst the four of you, so if someone is charging forward willy-nilly you’ll quickly find yourself looking at the Post-Game Carnage Report. If you play well and stay alive, you’ll preserve your life pool for the later, harder rounds. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/4cfec622d5d122fa7f767ae3db68777ccee9d50a.jpg But sometimes, deaths happen—we’ve all been there. At the end of each set your team will earn an extra life. Additionally, you’ll gain a life for each 1,000 points earned during the bonus round. So if you turn around and find yourself face to face with a Grunt rushing you with plasma grenades, don’t sweat it too much – you can always make it up later. We Need to Evac New to Halo Infinite, you’ll now be able to choose to end your match at the end of a set. Before the next round begins, you’ll see a zone pop up that says, “Complete the mission.” If at least two of you hop into the zone, you’ll be extracted from the mission and the match will end. If you don’t get in the zone before the next round, you’ll be committed until you either: Run out of lives Make it to the end of the next set If you’ve survived, congratulations! The next round is about to begin. Each set has a new set of Skulls that will activate. You’ll see a new Skull activate on rounds two and three, adding an extra layer of difficulty to the firefight. If you’re running low on ammo, don’t fret—you’ll get a resupply between each round.

1240440,March Playlist Update,"When Operation: Blue Team comes to Halo Infinite next week, it’ll include a hefty playlist update. We’ll be consolidating some things for Match Composer and adding some new experiences that we think you’ll be pleased with as well. Let’s get into things! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/9c1e52b591b834b925d063d46439cd39e35d72f2.jpg Match Composer As Halo Infinite has evolved, the Infinite team has worked hard to bring a ton of new experiences to the game: Husky Raid, Fiesta Castle Wars, Action Sack, Firefight, Infection, BTB Sentry Defense, and so many more. As a result, there are now a whole lotta options for you to choose from in the Match Composer. (The options are not quite infinite but pretty close!) We’ve monitored the data and seen what is being selected or searched for most often and we’ve been closely evaluating the health of the various playlists. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/b100ac615b187445127cc55f9f7187e30997b0d9.jpg At the same time, we’ve also heard your feedback that some of the current Match Composer lists are a bit confusing and not as coherent as they could be. With this in mind, and with spring on the horizon, we’re taking this opportunity to do a bit of spring cleaning: specifically tightening up and re-arranging part of the Match Composer. Q&A With the Infinite Team There’s a lot coming with this update so we sat down with the Infinite team and chatted a bit about the upcoming changes. What are the ultimate goals for playlist health overall? The ultimate goal for all playlists is striking a balance between low match times and solid match quality with the least amount of skill discrepancy between the two teams as possible. We want players to go into matches to have fun and get in those matches fast so trying to balance the two is always a delicate dance. With Match Composer, players have more freedom and flexibility to choose how they play Halo matchmaking than ever before. We’re seeing players take advantage of that across the board which we love to see. The downside to the Match Composer, however, is that it’s entirely possible to choose too narrow of a search resulting in really long search times to find a match. What are some ways you go about ensuring players can get those “good matches” of short queues and teams with low skill discrepancy? We started by looking at all the playlists available to players today in the Match Composer and there are a lot! There are nine social playlists with over 100 modes across the various lists…28 in Rumble Pit alone. Even within a single playlist, there are many, many different ways for players to “silo” (aka create a search so narrow that the time to match is very long) themselves via their search parameters. We also took a look at the options across different playlists and have heard your feedback of, “This doesn’t make sense here, it should be over there.” The goal with this update is to reduce the number of silos by working to group like content with like. When we look at Action Sack, we agree that that’s the logical home for some of the more wacky or party modes just like we agree that “Arena Objective” is probably not the best home for Team Snipers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/6233ce4b5338fa84bc6d036553f4c2c5ae0e8d9e.jpg How do you identify the problem areas and how do you know where to focus your efforts when working on things? So our first stop when it comes to checking playlist health/data is the analytics team. We can see what silos players are choosing, how popular a specific silo is (or isn’t), and we can see that across each playlist. So from Quick Play to Action Sack, we can see what modes players are gravitating towards versus what isn’t resonating as well. If we look at Rumble Pit as an example (remember it has 28 separate modes in the playlist itself!), here are the top 5 most searched modes (note: these are all FFA variants): Community Shotty Snipes Fiesta Slayer Ninja Slayer Shotty Snipes Slayer From the information we gather based on your selections and playtime, we can see that players in Rumble Pit prefer the more “serious” game modes available to them so moving ones that feel out of place, such as FFA Purple Reign and Kong Slayer, to a more appropriate playlist, like Action Sack, just makes a lot of sense. We’ve also observed that when players are wanting to play Shotty Snipers, for example, they select both versions available – Shotty Snipers and Community Shotty Snipers. To help limit the silos available, we’re combining the Community modes with the studio modes into one. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/a2cc9adce2349eb4883dba50ffd2a3bdeeeb62c9.jpg Another good example to look at is Quick Play. There’s currently 20 different modes in the playlist and with the top modes being: Fiesta Husky Raid Super Fiesta Super Husky Raid Team Slayer The silos at the bottom are incredibly narrow and aren’t resulting in many matches as a whole in their current state. We recognize those are fun and unique modes so we’re looking to move them to other play...",1741375254,
1240440,Operation: Blue Team,"Welcome to Blue Team, Spartans. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/080b9f5204909f41738fa443563345f0da050644.jpg This legendary Spartan-II team has a prodigious combat record spanning well over two hundred military operations against all kinds of foes—from the colonial insurrection to the Covenant, and the many threats that have arisen in recent years. While John-117, Fred-104, Kelly-087, and Linda-058 have typically been the primary members of Blue Team, the roster has evolved over time—and now it is time for you to join them. Operation: Blue Team is live from March 11 to April 8, let’s explore what’s new! Firefight Classic Bip, bap, bam! Classic Firefight returns in Operation: Blue Team. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/acb444bdeba4f4a1dbadef4c18f2e007e380177b.jpg You know the drill. Each new wave brings progressively more difficult Banished bad guys—five waves make up a round, three rounds (plus a bonus round) make a set. You can keep the party going for as long as you want. No, really, you could keep the good times rolling with your squad into next week if you really wanted to! Or—at the end of a set—head to the exfiltration zone and end the match. Try not to die, as lives are limited, but you’ll be able to earn them back by successfully completing a bonus round. Of course, a classic mode pairs nicely with some classic maps! Return to ONI’s headquarters in New Mombasa as Alpha Site and Security Zone from Halo 3: ODST return, along with SWORD Base’s Courtyard from Halo: Reach. For more details, check out our Firefight Classic playlist blog. Next wave’s coming in. Get ready, Spartans! Hot Swap A Spartan must be prepared for anything—a sharpened tool able to react to any situation on the battlefield. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/4ee543ced6d40c48f3023bda7ded1e090168afd1.jpg Hot Swap puts that to the ultimate test, as this team-based 4v4 mode switches up everybody’s loadout every thirty seconds—that means you, your teammates, and the enemy team. Maybe you’ll all get a rocket launcher, maybe you’ll get a plasma pistol. Whatever the situation you’ll have to adjust your role and strategy if you and your team mean to claim victory. It’s long been said that Halo’s gameplay is built on the foundation of cycling “thirty seconds of fun,” and that is what you will find at the heart of Hot Swap.

The locomotion and control on offer when running, sliding, and mantling across a multiplayer arena is unmatched, and the series' leading sandbox gameplay pairs so well with it that I'm constantly hoping it'll make a huge comeback.

1240440,Assault,"Defend your base – Assault arrives in Halo Infinite! First introduced in Halo 2, this mode is the reverse of Capture the Flag. Rather than getting into your opponent’s base and stealing their flag, you’re sneaking into their base with a bomb, attempting to plant it. It’s totally identical, just in reverse. Bomb Armed Assault comes in multiple flavors and the two being introduced with Operation: Frontlines are: One Bomb Neutral Bomb Some of you might be wondering… “What’s the difference?” Thank you for asking! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/4aadd0e8b0017783553394be67207dca5c698535.jpg Neutral Bomb starts with the bomb in a neutral position on the map (usually the middle) and each team fights for control of the bomb. Once you have the explosive in your possession, your objective is to infiltrate the enemy base and plant it. One Bomb is a one-sided objective mode that alternates with each team taking turns being on offense and defense. If you’re on offense, the bomb will spawn in your zone and it’s up to your team to mount the assault on the enemy’s base. If you are on defense, your goal is preventing that bomb from being planted in your area. Those of you that played Halo 2/3 know that One Bomb on Zanzibar/Last Resort was the classic One Bomb experience. So classic that we’ve got not just 4v4 Assault available, but also Squad Battle Assault pitting 8v8 in the battle of the bomb! After all, Assault is not only a really great 4v4 objective mode, it also plays very well in larger teams. The 4v4 Battlegrounds Some of these maps should tickle the nostalgia bone.

Fashion your Spartan with the finest flair in the brand-new Operation Pass, a vastly expanded offering for the first Operation of each major Update that now brings 50 tiers of customization rewards. Give the enemy team back their bomb as the classic Assault mode returns, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg… Let’s dive into what’s live in Halo Infinite today with the arrival of Operation: Frontlines. Fuel Rod SPNKr {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/673d63f248040adb57f36ba6936ddc05d182d8c4.jpg It’s not just old Covenant technology that the Banished ravenously repurpose and reforge into their own tools of domination, but the UNSC’s as well. Introducing the Fuel Rod SPNKr, a rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by the Banished and fires Venezian-repackaged fuel rod munitions. The Fuel Rod SPNKr works great against vehicles—its six-shot magazine makes it effective against a wide range of targets. You will be able to find the Fuel Rod SPNKr as a power weapon on maps, but if you want to get to grips with this new take on a Covenant classic you can jump into the Academy’s Training mode—or spawn it in Forge for some custom games. Operation Pass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/de31fbdacd08c26e86af8a87195ccec08ce77c58.jpg Halo Infinite’s Operation Pass has evolved! After tracking community feedback about Operation Passes over the last year, we are exploring a new format for players to earn more customization goodness for even more value. For the first Operation of each Update, there will be an expanded Premium Operation Pass which contains 50 tiers of rewards and four full armor sets. For the following two Operations in an Update, the Operation Passes will be the traditional 20-tier offering that players experienced in 2024. Free Pass As before, if you’ve been enjoying the free Operation Pass, your experience is largely unchanged. During the time the Operation is live, you will be able to earn 20 tiers of free rewards, including one full armor set. Premium Pass The price of the Premium Operation Pass has been slightly adjusted for this offering as it’s been expanded from 20 to 50 tiers, and from one complete armor set to four, providing the following options: 1,000 Credits: The Operation Pass is durable, offers bonus XP, provides an extra Challenge slot, and immediately gives you multiple bonus items. Provides the ability to earn four full armor sets. 2,500 Credits: All of the above, and instantly unlocks the first 20 levels out of 50. The Premium Pass is only available for purchase during the time the Operation is live, and will no longer be available for purchase once that month-long window has closed. If you miss out on purchasing any Premium Operation Pass going forward but want the customization content it offered, you will be able to find it in the Shop at a later date (and at an adjusted price). Likewise, the armor set from the Free Pass will flow into The Exchange and return at a later date where players will be able to acquire that armor with Spartan Points (earned simply by completing matches). {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/a358161d3cde8cce56511044a1409f2210edae36.jpg For a full breakdown on all the details of the new Operation Pass format, be sure to check out our Spring Update blog!

Updates & Operations As a reminder, Halo Infinite has a new update format. At the end of last year, we released the Winter Update from November 2024 through January 2025, which included Operation: Great Journey (November), Operation: Snowbound (December), and Operation: Brute Force (January). The 2025 Spring Update for Halo Infinite has the same format—three new Operations are on the way, starting with Operation: Frontlines on February 4. Here’s how the update format works: Since the first Operation is paired with the launch of an Update (in this case, the 2025 Spring Update kicks off with Operation: Frontlines), it will contain a larger offering of content. This is where you can expect a Spartan-sized delivery of things like a new sandbox weapon, new modes, and so on, while the next two Operations will offer smaller updates. So, what upcoming Operations have you got to look forward to in the Spring Update? Operation: Frontlines (February 4) Operation: Blue Team (March 11) Operation: Forerunner (April 8) And then, looking even further ahead, once Operation: Forerunner wraps up, we’ll have the next “seasonal” release with the Halo Infinite Summer Update and three new Operations. We’ll have more details to share on what that entails at a later date. New Weapon: Fuel Rod SPNKr {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/673d63f248040adb57f36ba6936ddc05d182d8c4.jpg It’s not just old Covenant technology that the Banished ravenously repurpose and reforge into their own tools of domination, but the UNSC’s as well. Introducing the Fuel Rod SPNKr, a rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by the Banished and fires Venezian-repackaged fuel rod munitions. The Fuel Rod SPNKr works great against vehicles—its six-shot magazine makes it effective against a wide range of targets. You will be able to find the Fuel Rod SPNKr as a power weapon on maps, but if you want to get to grips with this new take on a Covenant classic you can jump into the Academy’s Training mode—or spawn it in Forge for some custom games. As noted in the above section, the first Operation in each major Update offers heftier additions like new sandbox weapons. As we look ahead, we can indeed confirm that the Mutilator—a Banished-themed shotgun—is actively being worked on by the team and is targeting the Summer Update. Operation Pass Halo Infinite’s Operation Pass is evolving. We have been listening to and tracking community feedback about Halo Infinite’s Operation releases over the last year, as we are looking to improve this experience for players. Thus far, each Operation Pass has offered 20 tiers of rewards, typically including a themed set of armor, additional customization elements (such as emblems), Spartan Points to spend in The Exchange, and bonus items for those who purchase the Pass. This year, we want to expand our offering to players, so here’s what you can expect to see when Operation: Frontlines arrives on February 4. Free Operation Pass For those enjoying the free Operation Passes each month, that experience will remain largely unchanged. Playing Halo Infinite during the active window of the Operation lets you unlock 20 reward tiers as you complete matches and earn XP. However, if you’re unable to finish all or part of it during the month, the free customization content will be available to acquire with Spartan Points (earned simply by completing matches) via The Exchange as part of Infinite’s next major update (the Summer Update in this specific case). Play during the month when an Operation is live and mop up all the customization items in the free Pass, or seek them out at your leisure when they hit The Exchange later down the line. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/de31fbdacd08c26e86af8a87195ccec08ce77c58.jpg Premium Operation Pass The Premium Operation Pass is receiving an extensive overhaul, including an increase in size, bringing greater value for players who decide to upgrade. This expanded pass will be available in the first Operation of each Update. The second and third Operations will offer the traditional 20-tier Operation Pass offering. The Premium Pass supports the usual perks: It makes the Operation Pass durable (it will not expire), offers bonus XP during the Operation’s live window, and provides an extra Challenge slot while your Pass is equipped.

Rules of Engagement Action Sack is the playlist where the rules are a little less clear per mode because it’s not as straightforward as “First to 50 wins.” This playlist is made up of several different Free-For-All minigames that will leave you laughing.

1240440,Halo: Whispers from the Pyre,"May 2560. As the Master Chief cuts a brutal swath through the ranks of the Banished, a Sangheili studymaster and his Kig-Yar companion seek to uncover the secrets of Zeta Halo’s mysterious ring totems. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/511d15ee3c6acd035678378dc7c6b98325bd93dd.png Halo: Whispers From the Pyre is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube. Historian's Note Halo: Whispers from the Pyre takes place at the end of May 2560—immediately following the death of War Chief Escharum at the hands of the Master Chief on Zeta Halo. “It is our great burden, is it not? To guide the preservation of the galaxy—even to the ends of erasing it. Weapons of last resort, built by my makers many millennia ago to starve out the great parasite. This ring is but one of seven. Designed to preserve life, designed to destroy it. One of seven. But, this ring is… different. Reforged from the remains of an earlier effort, it possesses abilities not shared by its siblings. This ring has… many secrets, some even worth dying for. Many in my place would see this charge as a burden. Custodian of one of the galaxy’s greatest marvels—and greatest perils. I admit, I often found myself feeling out of place with others like me. The monitors of the other installations seemed to share similar perspectives and experiences amongst each other, but I’ve always been an outcast among them—by both design, and by birthright. A different type of caretaker for a very different type of ring. While zero-seven’s integral place within the Array is most unquestionable, its history and original composition allow for far more… direct applications. Applications invoked in order to uphold the Mantle… or betray it.” {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/5ca1a92b335ad9041d1b93890f99b9bbb1ec739c.jpg The voice of Despondent Pyre, the elusive monitor of Installation 07, faded. Studymaster Ciar ‘Yaham retracted his semi-circular datapad and clacked his mandibles in satisfaction as he scrutinized the great stone ring artifact that lay before him. Wisps of mist-like blue energy would typically indicate it had clusters of fragmented data to access, wherein ghostly voices from the past would slough off their digital embalmment to offer a fractured testimony. But this particular arcane curio had now fallen dark and silent. “Though this artifact appears to have been accessed recently, it still bore latent datastreams that we were able to extract.” Studymaster ‘Yaham turned to Dahk’rah, a Kig-Yar Skirmisher of a group known as the Mind Talon with whom he had found himself partnered in their joint efforts to uncover the many ancient secrets of Zeta Halo. “More from monitor,” Dahk’rah said, running a hand through her plume of red feathers. “Curious mention of Oth Koronn’s past. Reforged, unique abilities and applications… Great prestige for us if we find!” ‘Yaham nodded in agreement. Installation 07—designated “Oth Koronn” by the Banished and “Zeta Halo” by the Forerunners—had a fascinating history that they had only just scratched the surface of. Finding that history was one matter, but the process of interrogation and interpretation of data was another thing entirely. The Sangheili studymaster found that he was developing a fondness for Dahk’rah’s company of late. He had come to understand that, like many Kig-Yar, she possessed a great drive for profit, but rather than seeking abundance in riches, “profit” for Dahk’rah meant accumulating knowledge. In the days of the Covenant, that had been largely the singular domain of the San’Shyuum, but within the Banished it was just one way of many that anybody could make themselves useful. The mystery of the stone ring totems was something that they had discovered within a lunar cycle of occupying Oth Koronn, and both Studymaster ‘Yaham and Dahk’rah were determined to be the first to discover the truth of these strange artifacts. It had taken little work to convince Battle Officer Zeretus to establish a dedicated research outpost in the local area. ‘Yaham’s gaze swept across the vast landscape of the ring. From his position, standing near the summit of an alpine mountain which had been split in two by the Tyrant’s recent rending of the ring, he and Dahk’rah had an excellent line of sight over many nearby landmarks. To the north, the ring’s vista revealed an ocean of stars. Whenever the studymaster had looked into that abyss, attempting to trace the division between the dark of space and the azure sky, he had been moved to dizziness. At the farthest end of those suspended columns lay the Silent Auditorium—the site of the Tyrant’s immolation—which was still slowly reforming. Immediately north-east was a beacon tower that he had visited several day-cycles ago, where his correspondence with Dahk’rah had enabled him to translate excerpts of Despondent Pyre’s data. From there, the winding roads traveled eastward where rising stacks of hexagonal pillars—the building blocks of the installation’s artificial lands...",1734542771,

1240440,1v1 Showdown,"Guess what’s back. Back again—tell a friend. Today, the 1v1 Showdown makes its official debut in matchmaking! 1v1 Me Bro. For Real This Time. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/c5890f67e3c926659f90f52ae862f7ff721348d3.jpg One of the most common pieces of feedback we heard during the Combat Workshop outing was that you would love to take a friend with you for the ultimate showdown. We heard you loud and clear and the playlist has been updated to allow parties of two to search. Thanks to Forger Artifice, you can now literally challenge someone to a 1v1 and duke it out on the battlefield for the ultimate bragging rights. Rules of Engagement Before you jump in, you should know what you’re getting into and how to win. The victor is the first to win the best of 5 rounds. If you’re asking “How do I win a round?” we have you covered. You can win in one of two ways: Be the first to 5 kills Capture the zone Each round is a race to 5 with spawns resetting immediately after a kill happens to ensure everyone is on an even playing field. However, if at any point during the round someone captures a hill, they win the round. Yes, this means you can be down 4-1, capture the zone, and still win the round. Both players will be equipped identically with random loadouts that vary from round to round. You never know what you’ll have in your pockets so be nimble and ready to flex your strategy to adapt to the gear you might find. Just to keep you on your toes, you may be granted a round modifier (you’ll see the UI banner pop up) that adds a new twist to the game. Keep your reflexes sharp and be ready to adjust to whatever the game throws you, including a damage boost, low gravity, or amped up speed. You never know whatcha gonna get. Lay of the Land So, you’ve thrown the gauntlet and are ready to face off in the 1v1, meaning you’ve got the who and the what. Now all you need is where. We have found that standard Arena maps are slightly too large for 1v1, so with the help of community Forger UneeQ, we’ve taken slices of some of your favorite maps and created a unique set of battlefields. Between rounds, loadouts aren’t the only thing that changes—you’ll be teleported to a new map slice so the scenery will also stay fresh.

If the first round didn’t go your way, just take a deep breath and try again. The best of 5 wins and each round can be won in one of two ways: Getting 5 kills Capturing the zone Remember to keep a sharp eye on the capture timer because a smart opponent will take advantage of that and will sneak a capture right under your nose for the point. Both players will be equipped with identical loadouts that are randomized. Primaries, secondaries, grenades, and equipment will change from round to round. Additionally, you may occasionally receive a round modifier that will be denoted via UI banner. This could be anything from a Damage Boost, to low gravity—so keep your eyes peeled and your reflexes sharp.

1240440,Halo: Age of Retribution,"November 3, 2552. After the Prophet of Regret is assassinated by the Master Chief, the Covenant is shaken to its foundations as the feud between Brutes and Elites reaches a violent turning point. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/49fff8a0c7d48357bfa2d11670cf693cf992b0b9.jpg Halo: Age of Retribution is available here, on Halo Waypoint, as a free PDF, and in audiobook format on YouTube. Historian's Note Halo: Age of Retribution takes place on November 3, 2552, following the Master Chief’s assassination of the Prophet of Regret on Delta Halo. OVERLOOKING THE CHAMBER OF CONSECRATION, DELTA HALO NOVEMBER 3, 2552 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/00f740950676078e41c0b77207f48f256cc7a383.jpg “The High Prophet of Regret is dead.” It was perhaps the sixth time that I had heard the words murmured by Onsu 'Valonro in as many units, but they carried the same air of reverence, sadness, and disbelief as when the honor guard had first delivered the news. Word had spread throughout the ranks of the Covenant of the unthinkable. Not only was the Demon here, but he had assassinated the Prophet of Regret himself. Worse still, the order had come from the Prophet of Truth that, in an effort to eliminate the Demon, Solemn Penance must unleash its cleansing blaze upon Regret’s temple. Such desecration of a holy site was tantamount to an act of heresy, but too much had happened in too short a time to react and respond with dignified diligence. The indignity was compounded by the accusation that this was our fault; the Sangheili had been collectively blamed for being unable to protect Regret. A radical change was reverberating through the Covenant, as the mantle of honor guard was taken from our people and passed to the Jiralhanae. These brutes were still newcomers to the Covenant, yet many said that they had been shown immense favor of late, which had now secured them a position previously enshrined in our sacred history. Fourteen of us—myself, the councilor, the honor guard, and eleven others of lower-chosen rank—had gathered in the vicinity of the sacred ring’s chamber of consecration, where High Councilor 'Yajadai bade that we take a moment of restitution amidst the chaotic winds of change. By 'Yajadai’s command, I was to keep an eye on the honor guard while he was still seized by grief. It was not a duty that I was enthused by, but as a mere lower-chosen in such esteemed company I had little room to complain or disagree. I contented myself with the hope that my service would be looked upon favorably. “Remember the holy words,” 'Yajadai had said to us. “Take the Psalm of Sorrow into your hearts.” Those who went before are gone Those who left us wisdom They have found a better place And there their light shines on This wretched life is our prison As dark and cold as endless space But their blessed light beckons And so too does departed grace The words, spoken together in quiet prayer, buoyed our grief along to quieter shores. We sat for a while in a verdant clearing that looked out at the chamber of consecration, a great spherical cloister held within the unmistakable angular struts and buttresses that defined much of the Forerunners’ architecture. It sat above a large body of water that stretched off towards the horizon where shafts of golden light pierced through gathering grey clouds. Around us were towering formations of rock covered in lichen and moss. A winding path ahead ascended towards a Forerunner door embedded into the rock, and the path behind curved around to a stretch of cliff overlooking the full majesty of this divine machine—this god-engine that we were blessed to tread upon. It was Onsu 'Valonro’s voice that broke the contemplative silence at last. The honor guard called out: “We who walk the Path honor you, High Prophet. Luminous beacon of the faithful, we remember your words, your wisdom, and your courage. May your name be spoken with reverence by the holy lords in the heavens, and echo in the spaces below—through the Hall of Eternity.” At this development, High Councilor 'Yajadai gave a slight nod to me, an indication that I had done well in my task. Though I felt as if I had done nothing. “What will happen now?” I asked. It may have been considered inappropriate for one of low rank to speak openly in such a moment as this, but the councilor paid no mind to my insolence. “There must be a vote to appoint a new hierarch,” 'Yajadai said plainly. “The Great Journey cannot begin with an incomplete triumvirate. It remains to be seen whether my fellow councilors and I shall be recalled to High Charity, or if the appointment shall be made here on the sacred ring.” “And it is a matter of great importance that Regret’s successor be an ally to the Sangheili,” 'Valonro now seemed fully present, his mind sharpened once more. “Why is that?” I asked. The honor guard let out an involuntary noise, but 'Yajadai interjected before 'Valonro could formulate a disdainful response. “Because, young one, blessed though the hierarchs may be, the ...",1731091201,

1240440,Forge Overview | Winter Update 2024,"The 2024 Winter Update for Halo Infinite is fast approaching and we wanted to give you a look at the updates and improvements coming to Forge, including third-person camera options, enhanced Forger attribution for player-created maps and modes, and much more. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/6d24853ebc93325b6d7e985940af468c4521c9da.jpg Let’s dive in! Third-Person Camera Once upon a time, before it was an original Xbox launch title, Halo looked very different… Before the series became the first-person shooter we have known and loved for almost a quarter of a century, Halo previously saw a period of exploration as a third-person action game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/2b959bd1ee5c5b5d9ab2c672cfb9f3d45ae0f1b5.jpg Of course, there are elements of third-person that have long been part of the Halo gameplay experience, such as when the player gets into a vehicle. Adopting a third-person perspective has also been possible in Theater mode, where players are able to watch, record, and screenshot their previous matches, but—outside the realms of modding—there has never been a proper third-person experience in Halo. That changes with the 2024 Winter Update. The ability to change between first- and third-person perspectives will be available at a mode level in Custom Games options and as a scripting node in Forge. Players will be able to get hands-on with this in matchmaking when the Third-Person Firefight playlist launches, helping you to get a handle on what Halo feels like in this new way to play. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/3cfa961049db2db490b94e88ce0533173fce9c4c.jpg Improved Forger Attribution Since Forge launched as part of Halo Infinite, we have continued to build on this feature with continuous updates and improvements to the experience. We have also sought to improve how we highlight Forge creators, which is another element of the 2024 Winter Update. To increase the visibility of Forgers who have created the maps and modes you’re enjoying, we have updated multiple areas of the game to highlight the gamertags and more easily allow players to bookmark their creations. Starting next week, you will be able to see these updates on the following screens: Match intro camera Pause menu Scoreboard Post-game carnage report Additionally, we have added the ability to bookmark maps and modes on several of these screens as well. Commander Agryna Lines {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/b1307357cbcb42195b356db3d0d62b0b8922b701.jpg In Halo Infinite, we were introduced to Spartan Commander Laurette Agryna, head of the Avery J. Johnson Academy where the multiplayer aspect of the game is centered. Agryna also serves as one of the multiplayer announcers in Halo Infinite, and Forgers will be able to utilize her voiceover in the same fashion as when we added Jeff Steitzer’s voice lines to Forge. And, to allow maximum control with this new feature, you can also ensure that only the intended players or team will hear each line set up in Forge’s nodegraph: Play Announcer Voiceover for All Players Play Announcer Voiceover for Player Play Announcer Voiceover for Team These nodes will have Agryna’s lines for the following categories: Accolades Mode: Assault Mode: CTF Mode: Land Grab Mode: Lone Wolves Match Mode Titles Ordnance Score Mode: Stockpile Time Mode: Total Control Weapon Drills You’ll be able to find these new lines alongside the existing Steitzer lines within the “Play Announcer Voicer” nodes mentioned above. Be sure to use the “Announcer Voice” custom game option to better control mode communication. Global Lifepool Lifepool (or respawn ticket) systems have been a staple of many heart-pounding gaming experiences. To help bring the intensity of that win condition to all our modes, we’ve now made it a global custom game option. This means that players can now create modes with two different win conditions. If applied to Capture The Flag, the conditions could now be “Capture the flag or wipe out the enemy team’s forces to win.” Additionally, we’ve paired this lifepool system with global revive systems, which players may recognize from Firefight and Attrition. The new custom game options will be: Health & Damage > Lifepool Lifepool Enabled for Teams Eagle Team Respawn Count Cobra Team Respawn Count Revive Team Revive Auto-Revive Auto-Revive Timer Revive-Grants Over shield Preserve Revive Progress Revive Allies Action Time Revive Action Time Scales Per Revive Revive Time Scalar Revive Orb Lifetime Enabled Revive Orb Lifetime The new nodes added to help Forgers control these systems even more include: Revive Player Revive All Players Revive All Players On Team On Revive Orb Spawned Get Lifepool Lives Remaining Adjust Lifepool The mode possibilities with these settings are quite exciting, and we can’t wait to see what players are able to do with them.

1240440,Sandbox Overview | Great Journey,"Didn’t you know? Spartans never die. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/943f4685f15f830b31b648e9619bf786281a57ab.jpg Operation: Great Journey is landing next Tuesday, November 5, and it’s bringing a lot of great additions to Halo Infinite. Arriving just in time for the twentieth birthday of Halo 2, the Winter 2024 update will include a Halo 2-inspired playlist with legacy movement mechanics, Third-Person Firefight, new Forge features, and much more. Even with those head-turning additions, potentially the most anticipated aspect of the release is the arrival of a brand-new weapon. Let’s take a look! MA5K Avenger Originally seen on the cover of Halo: Ghosts of Onyx back in 2006, wielded by Spartan-III super-soldiers, the MA5K will be joining the arsenal of weapons in Halo Infinite as the MA5K Avenger. This fully automatic rifle stands out with its extremely high rate-of-fire, which is properly accompanied by an increased magazine size. Built by Misriah Armory for running and gunning at a short range, the Avenger also has a fast ready-up time after sprinting, rapid reload speed, and can be switched to very quickly. All in all, the MA5K Avenger has a commanding presence in Halo Infinite’s close quarters combat dance. To see it in action, be sure to check out our recent Winter Update Community Livestream! As we were building out the weapon, we knew it would only be natural to have it fit into the SMG role. Celebrating the game that first introduced SMGs to Halo by bringing an SMG-class weapon to Halo Infinite felt like a great fit. Our tuning process started by examining Halo 2’s SMG, which wasn’t known as the most effective weapon unless dual-wielded, and cross-referencing it with the SMGs from Halo 3: ODST and Halo 5, which were both highly effective and positively received by players. After plenty of fun playtests and iteration, we landed on a tuning pass which feels similar to both, yet has clearly established an identity of its own as a natural inclusion into this pantheon of SMGs. Starting next week, the MA5K Avenger will be the starting weapon in the Halo 2-inspired Delta Arena playlist, become your secondary weapon in many Firefight experiences, and start appearing on SMG-class weapon racks throughout the game. Equip your Mirage IIC armor, go hands-on with it, and let us know how it feels! Sandbox Updates A few other sandbox updates will be landing alongside the addition of the MA5K Avenger. Here’s what you can expect when you boot up Halo Infinite next week! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/7ef837901b6a0c26ea860bbe9c0f1dd0c8a4dbdc.jpg VK78 Commando Previously, when using the VK78 Commando at maximum spread, the bullets were trending only to the outer edges of the bloomed reticle. To give the VK78 Commando a more consistent feel, we’ve adjusted the bloom properties to allow the bullet to land anywhere within the bounds of the bloomed reticle. This is similar to the adjustment made with the MA40 AR in the Operation: Fleetcom update. To balance out the now more accurate Commando, the bloom will reach maximum spread slightly quicker than before. Increased maximum bullet spread Maximum error angle (high) 0.9 >> 0.95 Adjusted Commando Rifle error angles to give it a more consistent feel Minimum error angle (high) 0.6 >> 0.08 Faster bloom expansion. Upper bound deceleration time 0.2152 >> 0.2252 MK50 Sidekick The Mk50 Sidekick has always been one of the most effective weapons in the sandbox. We wanted to keep that consistent feeling, while also addressing feedback around it still feeling a little too effective at range. To accomplish this, we’ve adjusted the weapon’s bloom properties to incentivize scavenging while still keeping it as that reliable secondary weapon players can depend on. Similar to the VK78 Commando above, we’ve adjusted the bloom properties to prevent the bullets from favoring the reticle’s outer edge, allowing them to now land anywhere inside the reticle. To balance that increased consistency, we’ve increased its potential spread when fired rapidly. Increased base bullet spread Maximum error angle (low) 0.03 >> 0.35 Lower bound deceleration 0.55 >> 0.56 Upper bound deceleration 0.42 >> 0.43 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/adeff176924b5ae50f274bb96b8375692110bb99.jpg Active Camo “Sneaky beaver” flag runs are a staple of Capture the Flag which provide exciting and creative gameplay experiences. With that in mind, we’ve seen players on the offensive utilize the camo flag run with extremely high efficiency. To give the team whose flag has been taken a better fighting chance to stop a camouflaged flag runner—and to more closely match the camo behavior of previous Halo games—the camo flag runner’s Spartan will remain camouflaged, but the flag itself will be visible. Thruster The Thruster is currently a piece of equipment that offers a high reward but takes little risk when used during combat. Its quick dash movement while simultaneously always having your weapon ready to fire was something we wanted to look at mo...",1730408926,

A fully automatic rifle with a high rate-of-fire and increased magazine size manufactured by Misriah Armory, the MA5K Avenger is highly effective at short range. It boasts a large, 60-round magazine size, and its ready-up and reload time is faster compared to other rifles in the game. If you’re looking to enhance a run-and-gun style of gameplay, the MA5K Avenger is the weapon for you. Time to put it to good use, Spartans!

Third-Person Firefight Bip. Bap. Bam! Welcome back to Firefight: King of the Hill, things might look a little different to what you’re used to… In a throwback to Halo’s pre-Xbox roots, jump into Firefight: King of the Hill and you will experience Halo from a rather different perspective: third-person. Third-person gameplay has, of course, always been part of Halo by varying degrees—such as when operating vehicles, turrets, and certain heavy weapons—but it has never been part of the moment-to-moment gameplay. Available in matchmaking today are the following modes: Firefight: King of the Hill Fiestafight: King of the Hill Gruntpocalypse: King of the Hill Gruntpocalypse Fiesta: King of the Hill The maps will be familiar territory, but seen from a new angle as you navigate and battle the Banished in third-person.

1240440,Playlist Overview | Great Journey,"Picture it… The year is 2004, Mountain Dew and Doritos are the snacks de rigueur, and the sequel to 2001’s hit game Halo: Combat Evolved is in your Xbox, ready to go. Twenty years ago, the gaming world was introduced to Halo 2, and things were never the same. The multiplayer experience forged friendships, propelled online gaming to the mainstream, elevated MLG to another level, and was truly a catalyst of the early gaming and online eras. With Operation: Great Journey coming on November 5, we wanted to celebrate this iconic milestone by bringing the Halo 2 festivities to Halo Infinite. Here are the playlists that will be available next week… Delta Arena Delta Arena is a playlist intended to embody the spirit of the gameplay you experienced in 2004. Think of it as a modern take on the legacy settings you remember from days of yore. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/de3b9901b9c2f69bec3cf638540822928c4c87ef.jpg The Delta Arena modes will feature: No sprint No clamber Increased jump height Friendly player collision You’ll be playing a mix of Slayer, Oddball, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill on some maps that will look very familiar: Ascension (Ascension) Credits: bullet2thehead9, DISTORTED JAKAL, MikRips Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/3c73e95fea9bdd37eef7642e40059cfb9a527242.jpg Boulevard (Turf) Credits: UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, ArtNoob, MikRips Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/7cf1b6d698b85cfae1db56724269199c5172bc3a.jpg Canopy (Lockout) Credits: UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, MikRips, ArtNoob Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/e69653b5b8d43026eca2a9a845a222cf7d7006cf.jpg Conjurer (Warlock) Credits: MikRips, bullet2thehead9, DISTORTED JAKAL Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/a1d4f51d6a17d125fa6dc803d0cfb318b4e7d8e5.jpg Inquisitor (Midship) Credits: UneeQ, Mr GreenCastle, MikRips, ArtNoob, WookieCookies Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/e8cbaf203999952a782cb58ad3abaae9b9499a63.jpg Serenity (Sanctuary) Credits: UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, MikRips Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/2b0b6c1ca679d4d807f59326153dff8b9ef6e46b.jpg Beaver Canyon (Beaver Creek) Credits: UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, Azwilko1997, MikRips Bookmark {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/ec49b26d308405e0c781ad05ab155143767e1536.jpg It’s time to party like it’s 2024! Third-Person Firefight Halo has been a first-person shooter since its release in 2001 (except of course for some gameplay elements such as driving, operating turrets, etc), but it previously explored third-person action during the MacWorld days. As a result, players have often dreamed what Halo would look like from a different vantage point. At long last, that dream is a reality with the introduction of Third-Person Firefight! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/4871ae4b0b5f5adbd1162245ec69f3575ca4475b.jpg You will soon be able to see the Halo Infinite Firefight experience you know through a whole new lens. Battle for the hill on your favorite Firefight: King of the Hill map and mode combo while being able to admire how enemies look from afar (or around corners), while also allowing you to appreciate how stylish you are. It’ll be the first in Halo matchmaking history. At launch, you’ll be playing Firefight: King of the Hill on Normal difficulty with Heroic and Legendary following later. Here’s what is coming at launch: Fiestafight: King of the Hill Firefight: King of the Hill Gruntpocalypse: King of the Hill Gruntpocalypse Fiesta: King of the Hill {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/3cfa961049db2db490b94e88ce0533173fce9c4c.jpg And the maps you'll be playing on: Ardent Prayer Behemoth Breaker Cliffhanger Courtyard Deadlock Exiled Fragmentation Gyrefight Highpower House of Reckoning Kusini Bay Launch Site Lone Wolf Oasis Powerhouse Refuge Rendezvous Scarr Vallaheim You’ll also be able to explore and play with the third-Person camera in custom games and we can’t wait to see what you create with these options! Ranked Update There’s also some updates coming to the Ranked experience with Operation: Great Journey in the form of two new map additions. Fortress is a brand-new symmetrical map design that plays CTF and all variants of Slayer (Tactical and Snipers included). Players can expect fast-paced action with exciting moments provided by dual sniper battles, Overshield, and more. It’s a beautiful map with a unique aesthetic that will have players taking a moment to enjoy the view. Inquisitor is a remake of one of Halo’s most iconic maps—Halo 2's Midship. You’ll be transported back in time once you load into what is an amazing recreation. This map is tried and true. Inquisitor also plays at a fast pace in CTF and Slayer (Tactical and Snipers included). Be ready as soon as you spawn—the action is coming in hot! Along with the Great Journey comes a rank reset, effectively giving you a Great Journey on your back up the ranked ladder. Good luck.

1240440,Infection: Alpha Zombies & Refresh,"It’s October so you know what that means… That’s right, it’s the start of PSL (pumpkin spice latte) season! For those of us who may not indulge, it’s also the start of what is affectionately known as “spooky season” so what better time to roll out an update to the beloved Infection playlist? Alongside some new maps, we’re also excited for you all to play some Alpha Zombies. Yes, the classic mode returns. No tricks, all treats – let’s take a closer look! Alpha Zombies The fan-favorite Infection mode, Alpha Zombies, has returned! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/da6f5e739e40e338249abaf8a91f28e7ff1fdcf8.jpg This mode is all about survival instincts. Featuring simplified loadouts, such as Spartans with Pistols & Shotguns, Infected with swords, and no weapons on map – it should feel more reminiscent of legacy Infection experiences. Spartans Weapons: MK50 Sidekick & CQS48 Bulldog Equipment: Thruster (3 uses) Infected Weapon: Infected Energy Sword Movement Speed: 110% Sprint Speed Scalar: 110% Jump Height: 110% Gravity Scalar: 80% Camo Intensity: Fully visible, no camo Last Spartan Standing Weapons: MK50 & CQS48 Bulldog Equipment: Thruster (3 charges added) Unlimited Ammo Shield Multiplier: 300% Movement Speed: 110% Sprint Speed Scalar: 110% Reload Speed: 110% Melee Recover Speed: 110% Much liked Alpha Zombies in Halo 5 and Halo: Reach, it’s a bit more straight-forward but survival is not guaranteed. With only Pistols and Shotguns in play, Spartans will be able to pick up ammo from fallen teammates or ammo crates to keep themselves armed – all while fighting off the growing number of Infected enemies. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/d9ee10a6077c57b7f501d39042d46a4e1dfe7e84.jpg We’ve been enjoying playing Alpha Zombies internally, and we were proud to have iterated on it with the incredible InfectionHub community, Dreamz, and DarkMaiming during its development. Infection Intro The base Infection mode is also getting an update to help improve the experience based on data and player feedback. These changes are meant to balance the mode a bit more between Spartans and Infected, as the Infected had a bit too much power. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/9cf4034a739f38bb67a4aeea63ff003b591213f2.jpg As a result, the updated settings for base Infection are now: Spartans Weapons: VK78 Commando & CQS48 Bulldog Equipment: Threat Seeker (3 uses) Alpha Infected Weapon: Infected Energy Sword Equipment: Shroud Screen (2 uses) Movement Speed: 110% Sprint Speed Scalar: 110% Jump Height: 110% Gravity Scalar: 80% Camo Intensity: 80%, partial camo The update from 100% to 80% camo intensity was made to address feedback around being infected by an Alpha – without ever being able to see it. Providing an opportunity for counter-play went a long way to improving this experience. Now, the 80% intensity will appear to players in a fun way that is similar to Halo 5’s Infection. If the Alpha Infected walks at base speed, Spartans will only see the glow of their Iratus VFX but will not get red reticle or see them on radar. If the Alpha Infected sprints at top speed, they will be fully visible to their Spartan counterparts. Beta Infected Weapon: Infected Energy Sword Equipment: Quantum Translocator (1 use) Movement Speed: 110% Sprint Speed Scalar: 110% Jump Height: 110% Gravity Scalar: 80% Camo Intensity: Fully visible, no camo Last Spartan Standing Weapons: Any Equipment: LSS keeps their existing equipment Unlimited Ammo: Yes Shield Multiplier: 300% Movement Speed: 110% Sprint Speed Scalar: 110% Reload Speed: 110% Melee Recover Speed: 110% Global updates We’ve also updated a few settings across both Infection modes to help balance the experience. Infected Movement Speed You may have noticed this in each of the sections above, but the movement speeds of Infected has been reduced in both base Infection and Alpha Zombies. Previously, the movement speed was set to 125% and sprint speed scalar was set to 150%, which was proving to be far too fast and effective. It was less fun to battle as a Spartan and was tipping the scales too far in favor of the Infected. Now, at 110% speeds, Spartans should be able to find more success while still keeping the modes balanced for both sides. Weapon Damage Spartans have also received a slight increase in weapon damage, from 100% to 110%. This change is meant to help the CQS48 Bulldog feel more consistent against Infected players while still keeping the MK50 Sidekick at a 4 shot kill. Starting Infected In base Infection, only two Alpha Infected would spawn at the start of each round. This made it extremely difficult to get those crucial initial Infections that can start to turn the tide of a match. With this update, both modes will start with three Alpha Infected players in each round. This will help prevent slow starts and encourage both Infected players and Survivors to work together early on in the round. Last Spartan Standing Timer Previously, when a round reached its Last Spartan Standing, it would start a 30 second timer. ...",1729620787,

1240440,Survive the Undead,"October 7 UpdateThe nightmare returns. Back from the grave and more gruesome than ever, Survive the Undead claws its way back into Halo Infinite. First introduced last Haloween, the Forge Falcons’ labor of love made the jump from Combat Workshop to playlist just in time for the spooktacular season. And now, it’s back with a new map!Strategic SurvivalAt its core, Survive the Undead is an Infection based Firefight mode where you, the player, are trying to avoid dying. However, unlike the “regular” Infection modes you may be thinking of where everyone is looking out for themselves, you are in a team of 4 trying to survive the onslaught of infected enemies. Think of it as a horde mode. You can learn the finer points and read more about how this playlist came to be down below.  The return of the playlist, as part of the Operation: Haloween II offering, comes with everything you know and love from before and adds one brand new map:Station of the LostBookmark Abandon all hope, all ye who enter this abandoned station. Remember, there's safety in numbers so stick together.Survive the Undead is the first Community created playlist to go from Combat Workshop to Playlist and it’s just in time for Haloween! You can read a bit more about the Forge Falcons and how Survive the Undead came to life over here. Objective: Survive By now, we all know what Infection is. You vs the horde that’s trying to infect you so you become one of them. Usually round based, the game ends once all Spartans are infected or until there’s a lone survivor able to fend off the constant attacks. Survive the Undead puts a slight twist on the typical Infection and makes it a more linear experience. And, as the name implies, the idea is to beat the waves of infected and simply survive as long as you can. The rounds start off simple and get progressively more difficult, with points awarded for each round cleared and each kill. Spend your earned points wisely…or go ham on the mystery box (my personal favorite – who doesn’t love surprises?) and then regroup and get ready for the next round! Survival Handbook Looking for some pointers? Straight from the Forge Falcons comes this guide to ensure you have the best chance possible to survive the undead. Perks The three perks are Health, Damage, and Speed. There are 4 tiers per perk and each tier costs 600 points. All perks reset upon death and must be repurchased.

These drops are announced by voice lines matching their names. BoomEffect: Instantly kills all AI, granting each player 400 points. Benefits from Score Attack. Strategy: Use when in dire need.Spray & Pray Effect: Removes shields from all enemies, making them one-shot kills for 30 seconds. Strategy: Ideal against bosses. Mounted & LoadedEffect: Refills ammo for all players. Strategy: Use when team ammo is critically low.\Effect: Doubles points from kills for 30 seconds; effects stack. Also, keep in mind that this drop affects the points granted from the Boom drop. Strategy: Collect immediately for maximum benefit.Player Buy Back The Player Buy Back (650 points) is located in the spawn room and revives fallen allies, granting the activating player an overshield. It only works if allies are down. Ammunition Wall Buy The Ammunition Wall Buy (350 points) is in the spawn room on all maps, it has the ‘ammunition’ nav marker and refills the activator’s ammo. It can be used even with full ammo, so check before buying.

It’s that time of year again where there’s a chill in the air, the wind howls and bites as the night comes early, a thin mist settles over the fields, and humanity marches on—their minds and bodies fueled by pumpkin spice lattes… With this change of the seasons, it is also time for a new Halo Infinite Operation. Welcome to Haloween! Survive the Undead Get yourselves in the Haloween mindset with the Survive the Undead playlist. Grab your friends, gear up, and jump into a unique twist on Halo Infinite’s Firefight experience as you stand your ground against endless waves of enemies that have been banished from their graves. We sat down for a fireside chat with the crew of the Forge Falcons to delve deeper into this mode and its three maps. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38365036/f82bc0aa1c4c52a9ce74a81414ad3e08f87ef1cb.jpg Thank you for joining us today! Introduce yourselves and tell us about the Forge Falcons. Thank you for having us, we really appreciate this opportunity! Who are The Forge Falcons? Simply put, we are a team of Forgers who love Halo, obviously. We believe our process is somewhat unique among Forgers. We use a strict development path when it comes to our experiences. We have multiple teams (Forgers, Scripters, and Graphic Designers) each with a team lead to make sure we’re always hitting the quality you all see when we release our projects or promotional material. We hope the way we do things shows when everyone plays Survive the Undead in matchmaking. Let’s talk about Survive the Undead. What was the starting point for creating this mode and its maps? The starting point? Well that takes us all the way back to the Forge leaked build in the summer of ‘22, the initial reason we actually made this mode is because we promised it to HiddenXperia, but once we really started to craft the mode and saw just how much potential this had, even before Forge AI, we knew we had to get it out to players. And well, after Night of the Undead took over the CGB, we locked it in as our staple experience and as you can see, it’s still our staple experience over a year later. What can you tell us about each of the maps that folks will be playing? Night of the Undead Night of The Undead was the first of them all, it is a faithful recreation of the classic COD Zombies map Nacht Der Untoten, which is of course German for ‘Night of The Undead.’ This map is cramped, close quarters and has a horror vibe to it to give the players a sense of hopelessness. That’s the goal with this mode overall. We don’t want the players to feel like they ever have a chance at winning, much like Noble 6’s last stand on Reach. Countdown of the Undead This map was our second map for the mode and is a remix of Countdown from Halo: Reach, made to work with Survive the Undead and just like our other maps, this map also follows the same themes of what we set for the mode, this map is by far the most closed in and has a real feeling of “we’re doomed!”—which of course was the aim. Installation of the Dead Installation is the first, original map we made for Survive the Undead—the others were remakes or remixes, so with this one we wanted to take a completely different approach. With this one, we wanted to give the player a little more freedom when moving around, and have it take place in an outdoor setting by a Forerunner installation, making it feel very Halo but also not losing that Survive the Undead feeling we have across all maps. What can you tell us about the mode? What are some of the specific settings and features you’re excited for players to experience? The mode is heavily inspired by COD Zombies, it’s an endless horde mode and something Halo has never seen quite like this, which is probably why people really enjoy it. Since the last workshop, we have changed a few things. Most notably is the random weapon box and the weapon upgrade machine which now allow players to have many more weapon combinations and choice in what they use. Let’s dive into the visuals and aesthetics of this mode. What were some of the key visual elements you wanted to capture in these maps? On the aesthetics of the mode, across all maps, there’s normally a heavy use of some sort of atmospheric fog which really changes how a map feels. All our Survive the Undead maps are normally quite dark, again giving players a hopeless feeling—like you’re in a horror game. Another thing we do try to avoid though is visual clutter, making it easier for players to understand where the play area is and where the boundaries of the map are, and we think we pulled this off pretty well across all maps. Of course, there’s a balance to be struck between stunning visuals and gameplay performance when creating a Forge map. What tips and tricks do you have for maintaining that balance? Absolutely, you’re spot on there. Normally there does need to be a balance between visuals and perf...",1728090065,

And yes, as the name implies, this new mode is going to be especially relevant to the interests of the Tactical Slayer fans. Tactical Refresh If you haven’t checked it out yet, Halo Infinite’s Tactical Slayer operates on the same rules and basis as past game installments. While previously known as SWAT, the mode remains the same. No one in the lobby has shields and everyone has a precision weapon of sorts capable of killing in a single headshot.

When the match starts, you’ll have your trusty Mangler equipped, but there’s only one round in the chamber. If you make it count, anywhere from head to toe, you’ll be refunded your bullet and live to have another fight. If you miss, you’ll find yourself scrambling to evade the shootout and hoping you can get a melee on a player to steal their round. If that fails, you simply have to stay under the radar and play your life for 5 seconds to regain your ability to return fire.

It was perhaps an ironic phobia for her to possess as an Office of Naval Intelligence agent who spent most of her time deploying alongside Orbital Drop Shock Troopers and Spartans in coffin-like pods, but shimmying across a narrow ledge on a skyscraper over two-thousand feet high had a way of provoking such primal fears. All the same, she couldn’t deny the view—even through the torrential rain. New Tyne was a bustling metropolis not entirely dissimilar to the mainland region of New Mombasa back on Earth, or Noctus on Andesia. It was effectively the “capital city” of Venezia, an independent colony that was populated not only by humans, but Sangheili, Jiralhanae, Kig-Yar, and other former client species of the Covenant that could be found in office buildings, transportation networks, entertainment districts, factories, and spaceports. By some miracle, the city wasn’t a constant war zone. Veronica supposed that they all largely had one thing in common: they hated the UNSC. The humans who had originally settled Venezia cut themselves off from the Unified Earth Government many years ago, and now the colonial militia that kept order had pledged themselves to the Keepers of the One Freedom—a Covenant remnant group. Every group here had a lot of fingers in a lot of pies, as the Keepers had recently pledged their allegiance to the Banished, so the trickle-down nature of relationships between species and factions meant that the line of “friend” and “foe” in this place was more of a complex web that nobody wanted to get tangled within. And so, life simply carried on. It came as another slice of irony that, of all the places in the galaxy, Cortana’s presence was minimal here. The strange “peace” on Venezia had preceded her Created regime by years, so she had devoted her resources elsewhere. But that meant the Venezian power brokers now felt emboldened to start pushing their luck, dialing up their criminal operations in increasingly brazen ways—and while Cortana might not be stepping in, their actions had drawn the attention of ONI’s ever-watchful eye. Dare had met with Zef ‘Trahl’s contact with little issue, a rather eccentric and aged Kig-Yar named Ke’jah. His colony-wide transport business had been the perfect cover for the set-up. While travelling aboard a Ren shuttlecraft that once ferried Covenant ministers around their holy city, Dare had picked out the tower immediately from the vehicle’s viewport. The appearance of the tower itself looked analogous to a Halberd-class destroyer rotated vertically. This kind of shared architectural design between buil...",1727128686,
