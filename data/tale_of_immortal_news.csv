Fixed an issue with low frame rates when opening certain interfaces. In addition to the lag issue that has already been fixed, there is another type of lag that may occur due to certain mods becoming incompatible after updates. This can result in errors being written into the registry, causing slow game startup and lag during gameplay. We have already made some updates to improve mod compatibility. You can try the following solution to address this issue (please back up the registry folder before proceeding. This process is generally safe and does not affect the game itself, but if a mod has a bug or a modded save file appears corrupted, you may need to restore the registry): Open ""Registry Editor"" on Windows and paste the following path into the address bar to locate the guigubahuang registry folder: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\guigugame\guigubahuang Right-click and select ""Export"" to create a backup of the registry file. Once the backup is secured, right-click and delete this registry folder. Then check if the lag issue is resolved. If the lag persists at the same level after the update, you can choose to send us both your registry file and game save data for further investigation. You can export your save data via the ""Export"" button in the game's main menu and email it to us at: info@lightning.games. We will analyze your save data and registry to identify factors contributing to the lag and aim to address them in future updates. We are also actively investigating which specific mod is causing these errors. However, resolving the issue entirely may require updates from the mod authors themselves.",1732629822,['patchnotes']
