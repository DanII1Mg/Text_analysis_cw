It’s time for us to start sharing a bit of what we’ve been cooking for this new class: First, the Techmarine comes with its iconic new weapon: the Omnissian Axe. As every new melee weapon, this halberd style weapon comes with its own set of unique animations, finishers and progression.The Techmarine has a Servo-Gun ability, activating it will enable the gun to automatically engage enemies. In addition to that, the Techmarine has a passive ability to restore Tarantula Sentry Guns that can spawn on existing PvE levels. Lastly, you might wonder which Traitor Legion the Chaos Techmarine will be associated with in PvP. We cannot spoil too much right now, but we’ll make sure to give you more details in the upcoming weeks. 😉Here’s your first look at him!We are also planning a PTS session for Patch 12, so you’ll be able to test the Techmarine in advance and give us feedback on it.

2183900,September Community Update,"Greetings Space Marines, Let's rewind a little on what's happened this month and let's see what's coming!FIRST ANNIVERSARY 🎂September marks the first anniversary of Space Marine 2! 🎉🎈 We wanted to thank you all for the continued support and the enthusiasm you’ve shown for each update. Your devotion and passion has been a blessing and a source of motivation to us. We value your feedback and enjoy working in collaboration with you like we did through this first year.Both Saber and Focus are incredibly fond of this project and we’ll continue to cherish it. We cannot wait to see how this second year rolls out.Again, thank you so much for siding with us. 💙 You will see that this month our Game Director has left a few personal notes in the Community Update, giving away hints on the development of the game.LATEST NEWS 🗞️This month we released the 10.0 - Anniversary Update, including new free and DLC content such as 2 new games modes: Helbrute Onslaught and Stratagems, new weapons like the PyreCannon, the Power Axe and the Hero Weapon Variants, the Chaos Spawn and the Mutalith Vortex Beast, along with improvements and balancing on both PvP and PvE.​PATCH 10 STABILITY Patch 10 was our biggest update for the game and unfortunately a lot of minor, yet super game breaking issues or balancing misconfigurations got in it. I would like to apologize for the inconvenience caused. Normally, we would catch the issues during the PTS phase, but we didn’t do PTS for Patch 10 because we simply didn’t have time for it, plus we didn’t want to spoil the surprise. PTS will return for Patch 11 and all subsequent patches (unless we do another huge anniversary patch 😊).Dmitriy Grigorenko - Game DirectorRegarding the issues with Battlefield Conditions that have occurred since the implementation of Stratagems (i.e: “Equipment Malfunction” blocking the progression on Exfiltration), we were made aware of that and are currently working on it to prevent this scenario from happening again in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience.​STRATAGEMSOur objective with Stratagems was to add the hardest content in the game and we are not planning to make Weekly Hard Stratagems easier. However, we are going to continue to address some of the issues with Daily Stratagems in Patch 11. First of all, Daily Stratagems are random, this is why some of the Battlefield Conditions combinations do not make any sense or are too punishing or restrictive for no reason. The truth is that there are not enough Battlefield Conditions right now. With Patch 11 we are going to add a second batch of Battlefield Conditions (~50 of them). Having more Battlefield Conditions will allow us to remove some that don’t work on their own from the Daily rotation pool.Weekly Stratagems are completely different. Each Weekly Stratagem has a pre-made Battlefield Condition combination + level attached to it. All 52 Weekly Stratagems are hand crafted and are designed to be either hard or fun depending on the week. The key here is to make sure that it's different every week and, ideally, players have to alter their play style.We are working on allowing players to toggle Battlefield Conditions manually in Private Lobbies so players can come up with their own fun combinations. Siege mode will eventually see Battlefield Conditions integrated into it for increased replayability.Dmitriy Grigorenko - Game DirectorIn this Community Update we’ll tackle Patch 11.0 with a sneak peek, a new limited edition for the game, the upcoming demo and the Discord Quest.UPDATE 10.2 ⚙️In September we rolled out 2 hotfixes, the latest is 10.2. It fixes critical issues such as the Assault’s Ascension perk dealing friendly-fire damage, Stratagems having more Battlefield Conditions than listed and more. Also, the Sniper’s Camo Cloak activation cost changed. If you want to read the changelog, you may find it here. UPDATE 11 TEASING 👀The upcoming Update 11 will be released aound late-November and will bring 2 new cosmetic DLCs! As announced in our roadmap, the next Champion Pack will be the Blood Angels’ and it will be associated with the Tactical class. Yes, Tactical. Now, before all Blood Angels come to our office searching for Horus, please note that the Champion Pack will also come with its own unique Jump Pack, and its individual parts can be used separately like with other champions. We will reveal its design in the October Community Update. 🩸 As for the Salamanders Cosmetic Pack, it will include the heraldry of various Salamanders Successor Chapters, as well as different armour parts. 🦎 Regarding gameplay additions, the next PvE Operation will be an off-planet mission introducing a new boss fight. 🦇 Here’s a preview of the inside and the outside of the area:We’ve also seen that you’re having many questions regarding the Heroic Weapons. We will keep adding new Heroic Weapon with the major updates, starting with Update 11. We can’t show you them yet, but we can already tell you that the Thunder Hammer will be among t...",1759160010,
2183900,Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 update fixes friendly fire and nerfs sniper cloak,"A new <strong>Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2</strong> update today has a blend of good and bad news for players. Saber Interactive's Patch 10 recently beefed up its high-octane, Tyranid-trouncing and Chaos-carving experience with new PvE and PvP modes, and it's been watching the balance carefully since. Now, it's made the call to tackle sniper cloak abuse a little earlier than planned, rushing out an adjustment that was originally on the cards for Patch 11. Among the other changes are a much-needed fix for bugs causing accidental friendly fire damage, which should make your matches less hostile. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/patch-10-2-sniper-camo-cloak-nerf"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/mark-8-helmet"">Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 finally releases fan favorite helmets in new patch</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/deal-half-price"">Space Marine 2 drops to lowest price yet, and now's the perfect time to play</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/patch-10-out-now"">Space Marine 2 Patch 10 is packed with new weapons, modes, and threats</a> ",1758302277,
2183900,Patch Notes 10.2,"​Hello Space Marines,A new hotfix is now live on every platform. It fixes critical issues such as the Assault’s Ascension perk dealing friendly-fire damage, Stratagems having more Battlefield Conditions than listed and more. Also, the Sniper’s Camo Cloak activation cost change (which was initially planned for 11.0) has also been pushed on this update. Read the complete patch notes below:PATCH NOTESGAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKSHeroic Chainsword:Rebalanced base stats.Reworked its perk: Light->Heavy->Heavy combo now ends with a Stomp attack.All Heavy attacks damage increased by 15%.Stratagems:Fixed an issue where Daily Stratagems could have more Battlefield Conditions than listed.Camo Cloak's activation cost:The activation cost of the Sniper ability has been changed. Now it works this way: The first three uses of Camo Cloak in a row do not take away energy by themselves (the ability consumes energy, as before). The fourth activation takes away 5% of energy instantly, each subsequent one takes away a little more. After the last use, there is a 10-second timer, after which the activation cost again becomes zero.With the right perk set up, you can still do 5-6 cloak cancels in a row. Cloak cancel will still be very rewarding to learn and to do, but you won't be able to abuse it endlessly while staying invisible and invulnerable to enemies.Spawn Director:The number of Chaos Spawns in packs is slightly reduced and now matches Tyranid Warriors.GENERAL FIXESFixed damage for the Power Backstep attack when the Power Wave perk is selected for Power Axe.Improved flame weapons VFX visibility for allies.Fixed an issue that prevented bots from entering elevators in Exfiltration operation.Fixed perks dealing friendly fire damage.Fixed PvP connectivity issues.Minor localization fixes.Minor UI fixes.ESRB update pop-up: A pop-up will appear on the main menu to inform you of an update of the ESRB rating. This pop-up will only appear once. Please note that this update of our rating is just here to properly reflect what was already in-game for several months. There has been no change to our monetization system, and no changes are planned.",1758272750,

NEW FEATURES NEW OPERATION: VORTEXIn Vortex, you'll return to the Astropathic Relay on Avarax, which has once again fallen silent. Your task is to investigate and cleanse the Relay of lingering heretical presence, and confront a mighty enemy lurking in its deepest levels.NEW ENEMIESMutalith Vortex BeastMutalith Vortex Beast is a new boss in Operation Vortex. It is a towering, warp-twisted monstrosity that drags reality into spiraling chaos. It rends and crashes with its claws and unleashes storms of sorcerous energy upon the Astartes.Chaos Spawn variationsChaos Spawns are new Majoris enemies that can appear in all Operations featuring the Thousand Sons.Chaos Spawns are dark abominations, powerful melee units infused with forbidden sorcery. They are fearsome opponents, especially when encountered in greater numbers. Their varied mutated limbs grant them a highly diverse and lethal moveset. However, it is an Astartes’ duty to study them and purge the heresy.NEW WEAPONSPower Axe (for PvE and PvP)The Power Axe is a swift, aggressive power weapon capable of delivering relentless, infinitely chaining attacks. Wielded by the Vanguard, Assault and Bulwark classes, it allows a Space Marine to unleash a hail of blows upon their foes.This is a fierce yet tactical weapon. Successfully executed perfect parry puts the Marine in a Power Stance, creating a moment of tactical choice: step back and release a devastating Power Wave or press forward to continue the fearsome combo.Pyreblaster and Pyrecannon (for PvE)In this update, we are introducing a new weapon: the Pyreblaster & Pyrecannon, for the Tactical and Heavy classes.The flamer weapons now apply a burning effect on enemies, which inflicts significant damage over time (which scales based on difficulty). In addition to that, flames also slow down Minoris enemies.An effective strategy would be to try to set as many enemies on fire and keep them burning.NEW PVE MODE ""STRATAGEMS""Battlefield Conditions change weekly and daily, completing a Stratagem grants a new currency called “Accolades”. Reworked Data Refinement Shop on Battle Barge:The “Data Refinement” shop has been renamed and now offers a variety of additional items. Now, it will also redeem old Community Giveaways and Accolades items.You can spend Accolades in the ""Refinement & Redemption"" shop to unlock unique items.Added 6 Heroic Weapons to unlock with AccoladesAdded 6 Heroic Armour Pieces NEW PVP MODE: HELBRUTE ONSLAUGHTTwo teams of Chaos Marines will fight to control strategic areas, but also to take control of the Helbrute. The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player will be picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point. For the team that failed to secure the first control point to have the Helbrute on their side, they will need to slay their opponents’ Helbrute and secure a new designated control point.Controlling the Helbrute grants the team a strong advantage, but killing it rewards significant amounts of points to your team. One last thing, the Helbrute uses a Helbrute Thunder Hammer in melee, and a Plasma Cannon in range, and it can unleash a battle cry with its special skill to regenerate its HP.NEW PVP MAP: BRIDGE ​ADDED 6 CHAOS RELIC ARMOUR SETS FOR PVP​These Armour Sets are now available to unlock by playing and scoring kills in Eternal War mode. For each skin, you will have to get 9 kills in more than 9 Eternal War matches to unlock the skin of the class you’re playing. NEW ORDEALS ADDED FOR PVPADDED NEW FINISHERSFull set for Power Axe.Full set for all melee weapons against Chaos Spawn.1 new finisher against BiovoreADDED CHAMPION ARMOUR PIECES FOR CUSTOMISATION (ALL CLASSES)This long awaited feature is now available!

2183900,August Community Update,"Greetings Space Marines,We hope you had a wonderful and sunny summertime. ☀️The whole team wants to thank you for the warm welcome you gave to the previous Community Update. We were so pleased to see your enthusiasm for the Chaos Spawn, Black Templars, the new PVP game mode, etc!You also asked us for news about Techmarine, and we've got some this month!This Community Update has a bunch of surprises and a community survey, so read it carefully! 😉Let’s start off with the BIG news! ✨YEAR 2 IS JUST ROUND THE CORNER!We’re so close! The second year of content for Space Marine 2 is about to begin.Let’s take a look at the free content first and then DLC Content, in this trailer!Expect the Patches to be released at a similar pace to what we were used to during the first year of content updates. Several PVE missions, the Techmarine class coming with Patch 12, cosmetics for Blood Angels, Carcharodons, Iron Hands and much more await with this Season Pass.Check the Roadmap! PATCH 10 - ANNIVERSARY UPDATE The Anniversary Update is planned to be rolled out on September 4! It’s a free update, but also marks the release of the Season Pass II and its first two DLCs. 📅 Let’s see the content of this Patch in more detail, shall we?THE CHAOS ARMOUR PACK:The Chaos Armour Pack is coming for free. You’ll finally be able to change the armour set of your Heretic Astartes in PvP, but you’ll have to unlock the set first. Each class will require you to score a certain amount of kills per match to unlock the corresponding skin.NEW GAME MODES: HELBRUTE ONSLAUGHT (PVP)A brand new mode will be added with this update, and will be playable on all maps. Here’s your brief:Two teams of Chaos Marines will fight to control strategic areas, but also to take control of the Helbrute. The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player will be picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point. For the team that failed to secure the first control point to have the Helbrute on their side, they will need to slay their opponents’ Helbrute and secure a new designated control point. Controlling the Helbrute grants the team a strong advantage, but killing it rewards significant amounts of points to your team. One last thing, the Helbrute uses a Helbrute Thunder Hammer in melee, and a Plasma Cannon in range, and it can unleash a battle cry with its special skill to regenerate its HP.STRATAGEMS (PVE)Stratagems are a completely new PvE game mode. Unlike “classic” Operations, there are only 2 difficulty modes: “Normal” and “Hard”. What makes this new game mode different are the various Battlefield Conditions, which will change every day and week and make each operation completely different from what you’re used to. Battlefield Conditions can either help or hinder your progress. Upon successful completion, you will receive a new currency called “Accolades”, which can be exchanged for valuable rewards.There are weekly and daily Stratagems, and each Operation has their own set of modifiers. Here are a few examples of them:Summoner: Every uninterrupted call for Reinforcements summons the Extremis enemy.Where you aiming at: Friendly fire damage from firearms and explosives is enabledCadia Stands: Imperial Guards spawn on levels.Hunted: An unkillable Lictor constantly pursues you. Dealing enough damage will scare it away for a brief time. 😈And many others that you’ll have to discover for yourself! 🤫NEW PVP AND PVE MAPSOPERATION: VORTEX The Astropathic Relay has once again fallen silent. Investigate and cleanse the relay of any lingering heretical presence. This map has a special, unique boss, the Mutalith Vortex Beast. We don’t want to spoil too much, you’ll have to wait for the update to drop on September 4 to discover its moveset! 😉ETERNAL WAR MAP - BRIDGEA new PvP map will also be added, called “Bridge”. With long hallways and small tunnels, this map offers diversified battles and multiple possible strategies to dominate the battlefield.Here’s how it looks: WEAPONS TO BE ADDED IN THE ARMOURY 🪓 Two months ago, we showed you the Power Axe for the first time. Today, let us introduce the Power Axe in action! Hero Weapon Variants will also be implemented. These variations can be exchanged against Accolades (from playing Stratagems Mode, more on that new mode below). They fall in a new mastery tier named Heroic, which is even more powerful than Relic. For example, here’s the Xenophase Blade, the Heroic version of the Power Sword, and the Combi Melta, the Heroic version of the Bolt Rifle:​NEW MAJORIS ENEMY: CHAOS SPAWNBrace yourself Space Marines, this one might give you a hard time. Coming with a total of 3 variations, the Chaos Spawn enters the fight. Swifter and more agile than its bulk suggests, the Chaos Spawn constitutes a formidable enemy. Stand ready.

2183900,"Space Marine 2 drops new details about its brutal, mech-infused PvP mode","Last month, Saber Interactive confirmed that <strong>Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2</strong> would be getting a second year of post-launch support - hardly surprising, given it's remained hugely popular and that Space Marine 3 is a long way off. Still, it was reassuring to hear that more content was on the way, and from what Saber initially revealed, it sounds pretty epic. When Year 2 and Patch 10 arrive in September, Space Marine 2's delayed PvP mode, Helbrute Onslaught, will also hit the co-op shooter, and now we know how its mech-infused gameplay loop will work. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/update-patch-10-preview-helbrute-onslaught"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/update-patch-9"">New Space Marine 2 update buffs basically every gun, reworks Assault class</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/year-2-confirmed-pvp-mode-delayed"">Space Marine 2 confirms a second year of DLC and updates but delays new PvP mode</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/update-siege-mode"">New Space Marine 2 update adds Siege, its most savage PvE mode yet</a> ",1753917717,
2183900,July Community Update,"Hello Space Marines,Since it’s summer and everyone deserves a break, please expect fewer updates in August. This Community Update will be shorter than usual, but we promise it’s filled with good news! A WHOLE NEW YEAR OF FREE CONTENT IS COMING 🎁As announced last month, a second year of content is in the making, with both free and DLC content. This second year means a new Season Pass too! This new Season Pass will grant players access to the new DLC content. Overall, it will work the same way as Year 1 did. Let’s see what’s going to be free:NEW PVP MAP 🗺️Let’s begin with the new PvP map. Set on Avarax, it is a mix of close quarters and long hallways. This fifth map will be available for every PvP game mode.​Development still ongoing, final version subject to change. NEW GAME MODE: HELBRUTE ONSLAUGHT 🩸This new map will be introduced with Patch 10.0, and will coincide with the release of the new PvP game mode ​​“Helbrute Onslaught”. Two teams of Chaos Marines will fight to control strategic areas, but also to take control of the Helbrute. The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player will be picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point.

This abomination has 3 different variations, each with their own moveset and abilities. Take a look at one of them:NEW GAME MODE AND MODIFIERS 🔁Finally, a new variation will be added to PvE to bring replayability to the game. Some of you might remember when the 4.0 update brought a modifier that forced team members to stay close to each other to get their shield back. Following your feedback, we decided to remove this feature to rework it and bring it back later, integrated in a new game mode, along with new gameplay modifiers each week. This new game mode will come with Patch 10.0 (the specific modifier mentioned above will be implemented later, though). New free cosmetics and exotic weapons will also be granted for the completion of this new challenge. Stay tuned, we’ll reveal more on that later. THE YEAR 2 SEASON PASS IS ON ITS WAY 🎫2️⃣Without spoiling too much, we can already tease you about a few things:First of all, the Black Templar Champion will be the first Champion of the Year 2 Season Pass (coming with Patch 10.0). It will be associated with the Bulwark class. There will be brand new Chapters, as well as returning Chapters.And last but not least: this second Season Pass is coming with Patch 10.0 and will be available for purchase in September! 🗓️ JULY COMMUNITY EVENTExperience rewards for Siege are currently increased by 50% from July 29 to August 5. 🩸HOTFIX 8.1Following the release of the 8.0 Siege Update, some of you reported connection instability, and crashes.

I know they've got a paint scheme and that's more than most Chaos legions can say, but I want some proper bionics, augmented limbs, and 17 Servo Skulls to follow me round as I beam Multi-Melta shots at Carnifexes. Thankfully, Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2's Patch 9.0 gives me a little hope. There's no sign of my kitted-out Iron Hands skin, but at least my beloved Multi-Melta got a buff. And my Heavy Bolter.

2183900,Patch 9.0 - Quality of Life Update is live!,"​Hello Space Marines,The 9.0 - QoL Update is live now on every platform. ⚙️This patch brings lots of balancing tweaks in both PVP and PVE, including Siege Mode. It also aims to improve stability issues and fix crashes.Here are the topics covered, in order:Datavault UpdateGameplay and Balancing tweaksPVE melee weaponsPVE firearm weaponsClass Perks updateFirearms (PVE only)Combat - quality of lifeSiege ModePVPAICustomisationGeneral fixesTechDATAVAULT UPDATENew Ordeals for Siege modeNew Datavault reward screen, with updated UXNew entity Trygon in the Tyranids tab in the DatavaultWe are adjusting Datavault UI and internal unlock logic to make it expandable in the future, so adding new entries to it would not affect already given out rewards.- Dmitry Grigorenko, Game Director.GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKSAssault Ground Pound Damage:Chainsword and Power Sword ground pound damage increased to match Power Fist and Thunder Hammer's one.Power Sword ground pound damage got buffed in Patch 8.0 but wasn't listed in the previous patch notes. This change should add more variety to Assault's class builds, because all of the ""one-shot"" builds implied having a Thunder Hammer or a Power Fist exclusively.- Dmitry Grigorenko, Game Director.PVE MELEE WEAPONSWith this update we want to rework all of the melee weapon versions. The stats distribution was too complex between different tiers and wasn't following the same ruleset as firearms, where Relic tier weapons are strictly better than Artificer ones.This is a massive overhaul and a lot of popular versions may become less effective than they used to be and vice versa. We are going to make another pass at this if necessary, but we think that we need to do a clean up here first to move forward.- Dmitry Grigorenko, Game Director.PvE Melee Weapon Progression UpdateProgression for all melee weapons has been updated to streamline the experience. Relic versions of the melee weapons will now always have better stats than artificer weapons and distribution of the stats is going to follow these principles:­Balanced weapons have moderate damage and moderate speed.Fencing weapons offer the fastest speed but have the lowest damage.Block weapons are the slowest but deliver the highest damage.PVE FIREARM WEAPONSOur stats show that all of the firearms balance is in a good spot right now and all weapons are Absolute viable. While some of the weapon archetypes are more popular and more effective than the other ones, with this patch we wanted to focus on actual versions' balance. Some of the versions within archetype were underpicked and thus we would like to do a big pass on those, obviously. But in addition to that we feel like some of the versions didn't stand out much from their counterparts. Therefore, we wanted to increase the stats difference to make sure that the choice is more meaningful.- Dmitry Grigorenko, Game Director.Master-Crafted Bolt Rifle (02):Spread reduction increased from 15% to 30%.Recoil reduction increased from 20% to 40%.Headshot damage coefficient increased from 1.5 to 2 (~33%).Salvation of Bakka Artificer Bolt Rifle (03):Spread reduction increased from 30% to 45%.Recoil reduction increased from 40% to 60%.Headshot damage coefficient increased from 1.5 to 2 (~33%).Gathalamor Crusade Relic Bolt Rifle (04):Spread reduction increased from 55% to 70%.Recoil reduction increased from 60% to 80%.Headshot damage coefficient increased from 1.5 to 2 (~33%).Drogos Reclamation Artificer Bolt Rifle Alpha (03b):Clip size increased from 30 to 40 rounds.Reserve ammo increased from 150 to 280 rounds.Ophelian Liberation Relic Bolt Rifle Alpha (04b):Clip size increased from 32 to 45 rounds.Reserve ammo increased from 160 to 315 rounds.Drogos Reclamation Artificer Bolt Rifle Beta (03c):Base damage coefficient increased from 1.4 to 1.5 (~7%).Ophelian Liberation Relic Bolt Rifle Beta (04c):Base damage coefficient increased from 1.8 to 1.9 (~7%).Stalker Bolt Rifle Versions:Master-Crafted Stalker Bolt Rifle Beta (02a):Headshot damage coefficient increased from 2 to 2.3 (15%).Drogos Reclamation Artificer Stalker Bolt Rifle (03a):Headshot damage coefficient increased from 2 to 2.3 (15%).Ophelian Liberation Relic Stalker Bolt Rifle Alpha (04a):Headshot damage coefficient increased from 2 to 2.3 (15%).Ophelian Liberation Relic Stalker Bolt Rifle Beta (04b):Rate of fire increased from 180 to 220 shots per minute.

If you haven’t already, you should definitely read the full patch here. Now let’s rewind a bit, and mostly: let’s discuss what’s coming as the first year of content is slowly coming to an end. Shall we?WHAT COMES AFTER YEAR ONE? 🧐As promised, we’re excited to share more details with you, and even more will be revealed in the upcoming Community Updates this July and August. For now, here are a few things we can confirm:We’re happy to announce that a second year of both free and DLC content included in a new yearly season pass is on the way! This extended support to Space Marine 2 has been possible thanks to your unwavering support, so once again, thank you very much for being part of it!. Expect new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and… more 👀 It’s too early to provide more info, but stay tuned! 😉 Also, to celebrate the first anniversary of the game, a large-scale update is planned for September, the 10.0 major update. Update 9.0 will not bring new content, but only balancing changes. Unfortunately, that also means that the new PvP mode we were planning to release alongside the 9.0 update will be postponed to this big 10.0 update as well. While we can’t show you how it looks, the least we can do is to reveal what this new mode will be about:This new mode will take place on a new map.It will oppose 2 sides, but it won’t be Loyalist VS Chaos like in regular PvP. Instead, Chaos will face… Chaos.Last but not least, you’ll be able to take control of the Helbrute. Yup.As this new game mode is centered around Chaos, new Chaos armours will also be added to the game. A new melee weapon will also be added as part of this big 10.0 Update: the Power Axe! It will have its own moveset, execution animations etc… We’ll show you more on this weapon later on, but here’s a first look!Work in progress, final version is subject to change Finally, we announced a while ago that we are working on a new class for PvE and PvP. We’re now advanced enough in its development to announce that the new class will be a Techmarine! We’ll reveal more about this new class in the next community updates, so stay tuned! PATCH 8.0 IN DETAILS ⚙️Patch 8.0 - Siege Update was available via the Public Test Server on Steam. Thanks to your feedback, we’ve made a bunch of tweaks and improvements for the live game release of the Patch. So, thank you for your participation! Let’s briefly review the content, or read the full patch notes for more details!SIEGE MODESiege Mode is the new big feature coming with the Siege Update! Check the May Community Update for more details about the gameplay mechanics of this mode.For those who played on the PTS and provided us with feedback, we heard you loud and clear! You expressed your disappointment regarding the timer. So we changed it a bit. Now, it goes as follows: ⏱️ The timer has changed!⏱️The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit. It exists only for technical reasons, because killing lots of enemies causes memory fragmentation (which, to simplify, would cause a crash after a certain threshold).We've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer. Timer got reworked, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can get to a very short time on higher waves, there is a timer for the entire session and each time you beat a wave the timer increases. We've also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves so enemies will get stronger faster after the 15th wave. These changes will make players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Also, with some optimizations coming down later we think we can get rid of the timer entirely.We truly hope you’re enjoying Siege Mode as much as we are and we’re still open to feedback!WHITE SCARS CHAPTER PACKThe Assault Class Champion comes with several cosmetics and 3 exclusive weapons skins for the Occulus Bolt Carbine, the Stalker Bolt Rifle, and the Combat Knife.WHITE SCARS SUCCESSOR CHAPTERSThe White Scars Successor Chapters are the Dark Hunters, Destroyers, Mantis Warriors, Marauders, Rampagers, Solar Hawks, Storm Lords, Storm Reapers.BLOOD ANGEL COSMETIC PACKBLOOD ANGELS SUCCESSOR CHAPTERSThe Blood Angels Successor Chapters are the Angels Penitent, Angels Sanguine, Atlantian Spears, Blood Dragons, Blood Scythes, Flesh Eaters, Flesh Tearers, and Lamenters.TWITCH DROPS COME WITH PATCH 8.0 📽️To celebrate the release of Patch 8.0, Twitch Drops return!

2183900,Patch Notes 8.0 - Siege Update,"​Hi Space Marines!The 8.0 “Siege update” is now live on every platform! Here’s a quick summary of its content:New FeaturesNew PvE Mode — SiegeSiege Mode expands on our PVE operations, emphasizing endless enemy waves that challenge even the strongest teams. When overwhelmed, players may call reinforcements for assistance. Engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring strategic adaptation. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing essential resources used to summon elite Space Marines or a formidable Dreadnought, drastically shifting battlefield dynamics.The BattlefieldThe battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.Survival Against WavesFace increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications.Side ObjectivesDynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.Shop and ReinforcementsEarn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower. Note about reinforcements changes from the PTS: guardsmen are now cheaper. 4. Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.Boss EncountersEvery fifth wave introduces formidable boss battles, occasionally facing multiple elite foes simultaneously. Triumph in these encounters to progress to new fortress sectors.Infinite WavesIf your resolve endures through fifteen brutal waves, prepare for endless combat of increasing difficulty, reduced resources, and shorter preparation times. Even the Primarch of the Ultramarines understands that ultimate victory here is unlikely — but your bravery will echo through the halls of eternity.Note about timer changes from PTS:The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit. It exists only for technical reasons. In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer. Timer got reworked, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can get to a very short time on higher waves, there is a timer for the entire session and each time you beat a wave the timer increases. We've also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves so enemies will get stronger faster after the 15th wave. These changes will make players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Also, with some optimizations coming down later we think we can get rid of the timer entirely.Added an option to disable bots spawn in Private ModePerfect if you’re looking for a challenge.RTAO experimental feature added — enables in in-game video settingsDLSS 4 — better upscale, multiframe generation in NVIDIA settings for 50xx series cards.New Season Pass ContentAdded White Scars Chapter Champion. Added White Scars Chapter Weapon Skin Pack. Added White Scars Chapter Customisation Pack. Added Blood Angels Customisation Pack.GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKSExtended Weapon arsenal in PvE Added Thunder Hammer for Bulwark. Picking this weapon won’t allow you to use the Storm Shield.We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only 1 class can use the Thunder Hammer. We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.New Finishers for BulwarkAdding new finishers for Bulwark with shield — 1 for Hormagaunt and 1 for Tzaangor.Terminus Update for Absolute Difficulty A second Terminus can now appear during a mission.Carnifex, Neurothrope and Helbrute HP increased by 33% on Absolute difficulty.Level specific Terminus enemies (with the exception of the Hierophant Bio-Titan) HP increased by 66% on Absolute difficulty.Additional enemy packs will appear upon Terminus enemies spawn and again when their HP is reduced to 50%These additional packs are now slightly more challenging featuring more Extremis enemiesMission with final bosses can now also spawn Terminus enemies (previously, missions like “Decapitation” didn't allow any Terminus spawns)"".This change is made according to the community poll that we made a while ago. We think that Absolute difficulty wasn't tha...",1750928820,['patchnotes']

2183900,The Public Test Server opens once again!,"Hi Space Marines! ⭐ The Public Test Server opens once more today! Check out this quick FAQ to help you get started and ready before launch. ‎ {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png ‎ What’s a Public Test Server? Space Marine 2’s Public Test Server works as a separate version of the game featuring WIP content and features. Share your feedback to help us refine the patch before its official release. Your input provides an important perspective that will be reviewed by the developer team and have an impact on further game updates. Since this is a test environment, expect the unfinished content and possible bugs. As you will access it through a different game version, your progression will not be tracked. For each PTS update, you will land on the game with levels maxed out and all weapons unlocked. Please note that the DLCs won’t be available, regardless of whether you own them. ‎ Since the PTS is ""Public"", you are free to create content based on it. No NDA will be included. Which platforms can access the PTS? The PTS is only available on PC via Steam. It is not accessible on consoles (PlayStation/Xbox) or through the Epic Games Store. Now, let’s see how to install it 👇 ‎ 📝 Tutorial on how to access PTS via Steam: Just follow these simple steps: Open the Steam client. Log in with the account that owns Space Marine 2. Go to your Steam Library. Look for “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Public Test Server” under your Space Marine 2 entry. (Optional) Right-click on your Library entry and go to Properties. In the “General” tab, set the game’s default Language to “English”. Translations may still be work-in-progress when you try the new content out on the PTS. As a result, we recommend setting the game to English. Once you’ve clicked on this entry, install the Public Test Server content. This install instance is not related to the base game, your files will remain in separate directories and all future updates will also be distinct, meaning that your current progression will not be affected by the time you spend on the PTS. When the install is complete, the Public Test Server is ready to launch! Click “Play” like you would with any other game! ‎ Can I try every single feature that will be implemented with the next Patch? Most upcoming content will be available to you. However, we won’t share content that is too buggy or hasn’t undergone the necessary approvals on our side at the time of the PTS release. Also, some content might be present on the PTS, but not accessible to the players. For instance, you may see new Champions in the Armouring Hall but won’t be able to try them unless you own the Season Pass. ‎ How long will the PTS be active? The PTS will run until Patch 8.0 officially launches. After that, it will go dormant until the next major PTS update. ‎ Will my progress be saved? No, because the PTS runs as a completely separate game version. It does not carry over your previous progress in the game; instead, it provides all players with a default maxed-out level and weapons. This ensures that you won’t have to spend time to unlock all the features, especially the Prestige Ranks. It will also not save your progress nor transfer it to the official game version afterwards. ‎ Is multiplayer available on the PTS? Yes, even private PvP lobbies will work so you can invite your Brothers and Sisters to play! ‎ Do mods work with the PTS? Mods won't work with the PTS. Enabling them will cause the PTS to crash at launch. Please, make sure to disable them beforehand. ‎ How can I give feedback? We need your feedback! As mentioned in previous Community Updates, the primary purpose of the Public Test Server is to gather your feedback on new content, changes, and balancing tweaks we plan to implement in the game. Our main focus will be on PvE Siege Mode and Absolute Difficulty balancing. We’ve set up dedicated forum threads on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion, which you can find here. Thank you for helping us make Space Marine 2 the best it can be!",1749028290,
2183900,May Community Update,"Greetings Space Marines, Let’s review what happened in May, and what’s coming next! Shall we start off with what everyone’s waiting for?… SIEGE MODE TEASER TRAILER 🩸 Revealed during the Skulls Festival of Video Games, the Siege Mode will arrive on June 26. This first teaser trailer gives you a first taste of the upcoming battle, watch it if you haven’t already! Tear through unending waves of Tyranid and Chaos assaults and fight to survive as long as you can. Give them no ground. Let’s recap what we know about it already: The action takes place on Kadaku. Up to 3 players (either with friends or with 2 bots, just like in regular PvE). You will get to fight waves of both Tyranids and Chaos. Difficulty will increase for each wave defeated. Your class, and weapon progressions are shared between Operations and Siege Mode The Siege Mode isn’t a DLC, it’s a free update! Prepare to hold your ground and survive as long as you can against endless enemies, as only in death does duty end. ​Siege Mode will be playable on the Public Test Server (Steam) starting June 4. Here’s a tutorial on how to access it. How it will work ⚙️ You will earn points for each completed wave. Points are distributed among each player (e.g. if the wave grants you 600 points, and there’s three of you: then, each person will get 200 points). {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/55c25416184d4c71523316b925500b3312e4bfa0.png Spend your points at the Requisition Terminals to buy equipment or reinforcements such as Cadians and Marines (Each player can summon 1 AI Space Marine at a time. Choose their class without restrictions!). The strongest and most expensive being the Dreadnought, which joins the battlefield to help you for 3 minutes. Buy equipment and reinforcements to make the fight easier (or less unbearable 😁). Every 5 waves, you’ll take the elevator to change sectors and therefore field of battle. Completing each Sector will grant your more rewards (requisition points, armoury data, etc.) And most importantly, your mission is to ​give them no ground. Are you ready? See you June 26! ⚔️ {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/a6e531e31a5a74b4a50ffd3fef3ebda28f84c081.png Patch 8.0 - SIEGE UPDATE You’ll be able to get a first taste of the new content, via the PTS, which will reopen on June 4. Apart from Siege Mode, other features, free and DLC Content are coming with Patch 8.0 in June. Here’s a tutorial on how to access the PTS.

It contained both free and DLC content, including: A new PvE Map called Exfiltration and a new boss fight against the Trygon Two cosmetics DLCs: The Imperial Fists Champion Pack and the Space Wolves Chapter Pack The inferno Pistol, for both PvE and PvP (available for Assault, Vanguard, Sniper and Heavy) Private Lobbies in PvP Expanded Weapon Arsenal for all 6 classes New elements of customisation, including: Volupus Pink, Thousand Sons Blue, cloth colouring for Bulwark, hand customisation. Weapons perks and Prestige Perks were updated Several buffs, and bug fixes Read the details of the patch notes here! Watch the trailer if you missed it 😉👇 Nevertheless, the 7.0 Update brought a bunch of unexpected bugs: for instance, matchmaking became a big issue. Saber Interactive deployed the 7.1 hotfix first to improve matchmaking stability. Today, we pushed the 7.2 hotfix. It should bring a solution to most connectivity issues, specifically infinite “Joining Server” loops and black screens after completing an Operation. We’re truly sorry for the inconvenience, we know how much of a bother it’s been for the past weeks. “SEISMIC ACTIVITY” COMMUNITY EVENT Your mission has just ended. Were you successful? This time your brief was to collectively bring down 200,000 Trygons between April 17 and 27. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/e785444e0b43efd977b239ec3397a01a19878e95.png The least we can say is: you CRUSHED it, Space Marines!

But that’s not all, to reward your commitment in this event, the ​Porphyr Shield Chainsword skin will be available to claim through PROS. The code will be shared to you on May 5th and until the release of the 8.0 Update. So, stay tuned! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/d6cc06d71d8d8af11d31de6852581846ce59040b.png The Emperor provides. WHAT WE’RE WORKING ON CODENAME: HORDE MODE With the Trygon update released, our focus has now shifted to Patch 8, and it is getting closer each day! 🤫 Today we would like to tease you a bit more about what it is going to be like. First of all, you will be able to play up to three players (or with 2 bots, just like in regular PvE) and you will get to fight waves of both Tyranids and Chaos.

2183900,Patch Notes 7.0,"​Hi Space Marines! The 7.0 “Trygon update” is now live and brings a lot of changes to Space Marine 2! Before diving into the update, here’s a quick summary of its content: New Features: New PvE Operation: Exfiltration Prestige Ranks in PvE Private PvP Lobbies New Secondary Weapon in PvE and PvP: Inferno Pistol New customisation options: 2 new colours, Bulwark cloth colouring, hands colouring New Season Pass content: Space Wolves Chapter Pack Imperial Fists Champion Pack Gameplay & Balancing: Extended weapon arsenal in PvE Weapon perks updated in PvE Improved Matchmaking in PvE and PvP Various changes, bugfixes and improvements {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/07daefbb4a1d22617d0d1da295c3986fdab0868d.png — Dmitriy Grigorenko, Game Director PATCH NOTES New Features New Operation — Exfiltration Exfiltration takes place on Avarax at the outskirts of an Imperial Hive City ravaged by the Tyranids.. Your mission is to reach a Mechanicus facility, extract a rogue Tech-Priest and fight a Trygon; a giant, burrowing Tyranid that creates underground passageways for other Tyranid organisms. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/2efdd2cf86834005d666c3dd714446afad285c09.png Private Lobbies in PvP A custom lobby to invite your fellow Space Marines. You can choose the mode and map, and also change the gameplay settings, like score or time limit or even damage modifiers to create your own fun game modes. Prestige Ranks in PvE The Prestige system allows you to continue empowering your Class even after reaching the maximum level. Once you have reached level 25, go to the Armouring Hall and follow the activation procedure in the Skill Tree screen. There, you can reset the Class' progress to the first level to unlock one Prestige Perk. After this, you can raise the Class level to 25 again. Thus, a Class can get up to 4 active Prestige Perks simultaneously. Each prestige rank increases XP gain by 10%. Progressing your Prestige ranks will also grant you unique cosmetic rewards for each rank you unlock. PvE Extended List of Available Weapons Heavy: Heavy Bolt Rifle | Heavy Bolt Pistol Tactical: Combat Knife | Plasma Pistol | Heavy Bolt Pistol Assault: Power Sword | Plasma Pistol Bulwark: Heavy Bolt Pistol Sniper: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Instigator Bolt Carbine Vanguard: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Bolt Carbine Originally the classes were not balanced around having these weapons. Some of those changes are only meant to bring more variety, fun and lore accuracy to the game. Not every change here will make every weapon competitive with the rest of class loadouts. This isn't the last pass on this, we will continue to monitor the game and make necessary changes. We still have some more ideas how we can expand loadouts more, without breaking the lore and while keeping class identity, but those changes will take a while to implement. New Secondary Weapon: Inferno Pistol Available for Sniper, Heavy, Assault and Vanguard classes. Class-based matchmaking in Operations mode This is a first iteration of the system that is designed to reduce frequency of matchmaking with other people with the same classes. It is not going to prevent this 100%, there will always be some edge cases. We will be tweaking and improving the system on our backend as we go. Experimental skill-based matchmaking and team balancing in Eternal War mode This system should make matchmaking in PvP more fair. This is an experimental feature, we will be turning it on and off on the backend and monitoring the results. It will take a while for it to shape up. Public Test Server (PTS) We are really happy with the PTS experiment that we had. We got a lot of feedback from the community that allowed us to implement changes ahead of actual live release. While having PTS is an additional stress for our team and will cause some delays to live patches we are going to keep doing that for all major content updates moving forward. The PTS will be closed for now, but we’ll reopen it once we’ll be looking for your feedback on upcoming features.

2183900,March Community Update,"Greetings Brothers and Sisters, Many announcements have taken place throughout March. Let’s rewind a bit, and then let’s dive into the upcoming content! We’ll also tackle the polls taken to make the Absolute Difficulty more to your liking. MONTH’S REWIND We’ve made a huge announcement ⭐⭐⭐ Mid-March, we announced that Space Marine 3 had begun development and we’re excited to see your enthusiasm, although we hear those of you who fear for Space Marine 2 and its future support. So let us set the record straight: Space Marine 3 does not mean the end of Space Marine 2's development. ​Far from it. No teams are shifting over, no one is abandoning the game, and our plans to bring more awesome content to Space Marine 2 remain. We are working on much more content and surprises for the months to come, such as a new class, more operations, melee weapons, and more! Trust us, there are surprises even dataminers haven’t found out about :) This announcement simply marks the genesis of a new project, years away from release. We’ve made a decision and have just started the process. Many of you were very excited for this project and this makes us incredibly happy and motivated. Thank you for the unwavering support. That being said, we still have a lot to offer to the players with Space Marine 2. We launched the PTS on March 13! The Public Test Server was made available mid-march and you’ve been very dedicated and serious about it! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/5ec61352a7be0277f5d94254c2a9496f54626c7b.png We’ve opened a forum on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion on the content featured in the PTS. Even if we might not have enough time on our hands to reply to every thread, we’re collecting your thoughts and making adjustments on our side. So, thank you! We already started to compile your feedback, and we’ll implement some of them directly on a PTS update that will come early April. Regarding your feedback on the PTS features, we want to tackle the most important one here: Prestige Perks are not gamechanger, they are too weak and not worth the effort. 💬 Prestige Perks have not been conceived as game breaking perks meant to allow you to roll on late game content. Another way to say it is that we don’t want the Prestige Perks to be so strong they become “must-haves” for higher difficulties. We really want to emphasize that you don’t need Prestige Perks to beat Absolute difficulty. This would make grinding for them an obligation when we really want them as minor rewards for those who choose to pursue them. The idea behind Prestige Perks is to provide you with more replayability, so you actually have a purpose farming PvE content (other than purging for the Imperium of course!). We don't want players to feel like they need to base their builds upon prestige perks, otherwise it will feel like a forced grind. Don’t forget that there’s a unique cosmetic for each class to unlock once you maxed out a class. Prestige Ranks are resetting the class progression to level 1, it will be tedious and too long to get level 25 again. 💬 In recent updates we've increased the amount of xp players are getting in preparation for the prestige system. We've added extermination bonus, quick match bonus, plus new difficulties grant more xp. On top of that we’ll add an XP bonus to make your post-prestige progression faster. Again, we are trying to strike the balance between having something to keep playing and not forcing players to grind for a hundred hours. The Prestige Perks for the Heavy Class are too centered around melee combat. 💬 We are working on changes regarding the Heavy’s Prestige Perks to better integrate them for Heavy’s builds. Assault should have access to the Inferno Pistol! 💬 Absolutely, that’s why we’ll include the weapon to Assault’s options starting from the next PTS update. Join the players on Discord if you want to chat about this PTS and the future instances! ‎ ⌛ Patch 7.0 - Trygon Update Patch 7.0 will be released in mid-April on all platforms.

Don't forget that the PTS functions like a separate game. If you have questions, please make sur to read the FAQ here! And for those who want to read the detailed patch notes, it's here! The Emperor protects! ",1741860370,
2183900,The PTS is coming - Get ready for it with this FAQ!,"Hi Space Marines! ⭐ The Public Test Server opens March 13! Check out this quick FAQ to help you get started and ready before launch. ‎ {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png ‎ What’s a Public Test Server? Space Marine 2’s Public Test Server works as a separate version of the game featuring WIP content and features. Share your feedback to help us refine the patch before its official release. Your input provides an important perspective that will be reviewed by the developer team and have an impact on further game updates. Since this is a test environment, expect the unfinished content and possible bugs. As you will access it through a different game version, your progression will not be tracked. For each PTS update, you will land on the game with levels maxed out and all weapons unlocked. Please note that the DLCs won’t be available, regardless of whether you own them. ‎ Since the PTS is ""Public"", you are free to create content based on it. No NDA will be included. Which platforms can access the PTS? The PTS is only available on PC via Steam. It is not accessible on consoles (PlayStation/Xbox) or through the Epic Games Store. Now, let’s see how to install it 👇 ‎ 📝 Tutorial on how to access PTS via Steam: Just follow these simple steps: Open the Steam client. Log in with the account that owns Space Marine 2. Go to your Steam Library. Look for “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Public Test Server” under your Space Marine 2 entry. (Optional) Right-click on your Library entry and go to Properties. In the “General” tab, set the game’s default Language to “English”. Translations may still be work-in-progress when you try the new content out on the PTS. As a result, we recommend setting the game to English. Once you’ve clicked on this entry, install the Public Test Server content. This install instance is not related to the base game, your files will remain in separate directories and all future updates will also be distinct, meaning that your current progression will not be affected by the time you spend on the PTS. When the install is complete, the Public Test Server is ready to launch! Click “Play” like you would with any other game! ‎ Can I try every single feature that will be implemented with the next Patch? Most upcoming content will be available to you. However, we won’t share content that is too buggy or hasn’t undergone the necessary approvals on our side at the time of the PTS release. Also, some content might be present on the PTS, but not accessible to the players. For instance, you may see new Champions in the Armouring Hall but won’t be able to try them. ‎ How long will the PTS be active? The PTS will run until Patch 7.0 officially launches. After that, it will go dormant until the next major PTS update. ‎ Will my progress be saved? No, because the PTS runs as a completely separate game version. It does not carry over your previous progress in the game; instead, it provides all players with a default maxed-out level and weapons. This ensures that you won’t have to spend time to unlock all the features, especially the Prestige Ranks. It will also not save your progress nor transfer it to the official game version afterwards. ‎ Is multiplayer available on the PTS? Yes, even private PvP lobbies will work so you can invite your Brothers and Sisters to play! ‎ Do mods work with the PTS? Mods won't work with the PTS. Enabling them will cause the PTS to crash at launch. Please, make sure to disable them beforehand. ‎ How can I give feedback? We need your feedback! As mentioned in previous Community Updates, the primary purpose of the Public Test Server is to gather your feedback on new content, changes, and balancing tweaks we plan to implement in the game. Our main focus will be on PvE Prestige Ranks and Weapon Perks. Feedback on these two items will be the most beneficial. We’ve set up dedicated forum threads on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion, which you can find here. Thank you for helping us make Space Marine 2 the best it can be! ‎ {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png ‎ What’s included in Patch 7.0 on the PTS? For this first session, you’ll be able to check the upcoming content of Patch 7.0, which includes: PvE PvE Prestige Ranks PvE New Map - Exfiltration (excluding final bossfight). Please note that when reaching the final boss arena, the ""Victory"" screen starts as soon as you interact with the terminal and the classic mission end behaviour follows (loadings, result screens and return to Battle Barge).

2183900,Hotfix 6.2 Patch Notes,"Hello Space Marines, As announced in the February Community Update, hotfix 6.2 has been deployed on every platform. This is a small patch that mostly focuses on crash fixes and minor balancing tweaks in preparation of a major Patch 7 that would focus on weapon perks and weapon loadouts rebalance. As usual, if you encounter issues with this update, let us know by making a bug report here. You'll find the complete patch notes down below. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png PATCH NOTES General Fixes Datavault ordeal Shredding Shrapnel now requires to kill 2 enemies simultaneously with a single frag grenade instead of 3. Fixed an issue with the AI Director that could sometimes spawn too many spore mines for a very long period. Fixed several issues that would cause Assault class to teleport back after using its Jump Pack ability. Minor localization fixes. Perk PvE Updates Overall we are quite happy with 6.0 perks rebalance, we are seeing way more build variety for all classes across all difficulties and seeing people experimenting with their builds more. That being said, there are still some perks that will require more attention or even full rework. We will be monitoring the situation and will be making necessary tweaks. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/c741d6ad228423769275bff7e195c4362308e0d3.png Heightened Vigour: - Fixed not triggering by perfect Parry or Block in some cases. Close Targeting: - Damage increased from 15% to 25%. Concentrated Fire: - Bonus duration of the Auspex Scan zone increased from 40% to 60%. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/1abf8c6d07944560f7c6535488e606fe81f15ea4.png Perseverance: - Damage reduction bonus increased from 15% to 25%. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/49a8b1e1d75b916ba063b4bcda14fc04e773850c.png Restless Fortitude: - Damage reduction bonus increased from 20% to 40%. Tactical Prowess: - Minimum enemy HP for auto finisher increased from 25% to 33%. Unmatched Zeal: - Health regen bonus increased from 20% to 30%. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/b008de073c9e7e17f7c5410a6ebec4145b7304ca.png Block Break: - Damage increased from 25% to 50%. Evasion: - Fixed typo in the description, now it shows correct cooldown of 30 seconds instead of 15 seconds. Efficient Readiness: - Fixed typo in the description, now it shows correct 20% movement boost instead of 10%. Pattern of Excellence: - Fixed typo in the description, now it shows correct cooldown of 30 seconds instead of 180 seconds. Note: This perk was buffed in the 6.0 patch, but localization was not updated and it was missing in patch notes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/6dc73b997ce968ed4d170cec92bf099029c43431.png Chapter Banner (starting perk): - Bonus health increased from 20% to 30%. Emergency Countermeasure: - Cooldown reduced from 120 to 90 seconds. Defensive Mastery: - Cooldown reduced from 120 to 90 seconds. Glory's Shield: - Now the perk protects not only from Ranged Damage but from all incoming Damage. Note: This should improve support Bulwark build a lot, since this perk doesn't impact Banner cooldown Invigorating Icon: - The ability regeneration slowdown has been fixed, but the regeneration penalty is now -50% instead of -100%. Note: This perk has been discussed a lot in previous patch notes and here are my honest thoughts on this. We've made a mistake making this perk in the first place. It changes the class behavior too much from what was originally intended. Bulwark is supposed to tank enemies and support his team mates, he isn't a dedicated healer. But players are now used to this playstyle a lot and now absolutely any change to this perk will cause negativity from the community. The perk itself is so powerful that it is simply mandatory, plus it also changes how the ability is used. Unlike other classes where abilities are used whenever the player wants, it turns the banner into an ability that the player saves for the very last moment. In our game it is absolutely fine, if you want to use it that way, but the problem is that with certain other perks you can bring its cooldown to ~20 seconds. This means that not picking this perk will be detrimental to your squad. No matter what the numbers on the neighboring perks, players will always stick to the ability to fully heal when needed. We want to come back and rework this perk or, rather, perk column in later patches, but this requires some time of experimenting and testing. For now we are tweaking numbers to make a compromise between previous patch and community feedback. - Dmitriy Grigorenko, Game Director. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/8884de443755dac7bb5665350a070df9cb37914c.png Fortitude: - Health increases from 20% to 30%. Conversion Field: - Radius increased from 10 to 20 meters. Weapons Balancing Power Sword We are very happy with the current melee balance. All melee options are now viable and getting picked by players across all difficulties. However, we see that Power Sword isn't strong enough, compared to much easier to wield Chainsword. It takes...",1741082600,
2183900,February Community Update,"Hello Space Marines 🫡 Let’s recap what occurred in February on Space Marine 2 a bit and then we’ll tackle future topics! We know you're eager for Patch 7 to drop! There's still a bit of a wait, but in the meantime, we'll be sure to tease you a little. FEBRUARY RECAP This month we released the 6.0 Datavault Update, containing new free and Season Pass content. You may check the entire changelog here! 📖 Mostly, the biggest features that were added to the game are: The Datavault, with new cosmetic rewards The Biovore New PvP Map “Tomb” Salamanders Champion Pack Raven Guard Cosmetic Pack including its Successor Chapters FOV Slider Perks rework Following that, we released the 6.1 Hotfix to help with a few remaining bugs and connectivity issues, mostly. Again, you can read the patch notes here. We are aware that with these two updates, a few issues remain, such as: FPS drops Too many spore mines spawning at the same time We’re actively working on it. Hotfix 6.2 will arrive next week. It shall fix the spore mines issue and bring some balancing tweaks. IMPERIAL VIGIL COMMUNITY EVENT We heard about your desire to have an emblem-less Mk VIII Errant Helmet, so here’s your chance! ✨ This cosmetic is entirely free, the only requirement is to link your PROS account to Space Marine 2. Here’s your brief: “Achieve a victory with each of 6 classes in Operations Mode to win the emblem-less Mark VIII Errant Helmet” {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/876731048e75bea664881bc7949c13b396be58a9.png The event lasts until March 3rd. NOTE ABOUT COMMUNITY EVENTS We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items. We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone. However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far. We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining. WHAT’S COMING… The 7.0 Update is in the making! ✨ We’re working on it and we’ll give you a more precise date once we get one. 🙌 This update will bring several awaited features: One Chapter Pack One Champion Pack Private PvP lobbies A new weapon (only in PvE for now) New Operation Weapon perks rebalance Class weapon loadouts rework PvE Prestige Rank: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk. Choose them wisely, because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the 4 Prestige Levels. On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part. and more! Stay tuned, we’ll soon come with more info. HORDE MODE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/43315296/6f4bd2012c6235fab5e95505ccc44b45a4d0c5db.png …..So apparently you’re waiting for the Horde Mode. You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now. One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about. 😉 Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it! Bear with us 🙏 PUBLIC TEST SERVER We’re also excited to share our goal to launch our Public Test Servers in just a few weeks! 🙌 Expect it to take place in March and before Patch 7. Once we get a specific date, we’ll make an official statement on our socials and Discord! This will give you early access to upcoming features and the opportunity to share your feedback, helping us refine the content before its official release. It will exclusively happen on Steam, neither on EGS nor consoles. It will be very easy to install because it will act as a separate game. COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON THE NEW ABSOLUTE DIFFICULTY - A word from our Game Director We would like to hear your opinion regarding Absolute difficulty. Overall, we are quite happy with how intense the difficulty itself is. We see that it requires a lot of concentration and we feel like it’s fun in terms of how many enemies you have to face, how hard they hit you etc. At the same time, we see some comments that it’s a bit easy. Yet on the other hand we don’t want to mess it up and would like to hear the voice of the community first. Here is some data and context. According to our stats, the average win rate on Absolute difficulty is ~60% (significantly higher than Lethal difficulty that sits at 50%), which seems a bit higher than we expected. At the same time such high win rate is explained by three facts: Absolute difficulty is locked for new use...",1740675625,
