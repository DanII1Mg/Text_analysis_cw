1046930,Retake the City,"RETAKE THE CITY Hello Underlords! We hope everyone is staying safe and keeping their distance. While it’s been a bit of a transition moving to a work-from-home situation, the team is happy to announce that one of the features on our ‘post ship’ pile is ready to go - City Crawl Prestige! It's been exciting to see the community having as much fun as we've had playing City Crawl. We were even more excited to see just how many people have already completed the entire thing! To that end, today we are adding City Crawl Prestige to Dota Underlords. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/bf893a4d9ccaada12f3e605a6a2dfc1106e3a826.png When you’ve taken over all of White Spire, you now have the option of Prestiging. When you do this, the whole city gets reset, including all of your Streetfight items. This time completing City Crawl will be rather harder, but the Streetfight items you’ll earn will also be rather stronger (and have spiffy new names, check them out during the fights). To mark the occasion, players who have completed City Crawl at least once get a Prestige seal on their Wanted Poster, as well as a flashy crown for all of your Underlords in-game. And yes, you’ll be able to Prestige multiple times. We’re also taking this opportunity to dress up the Wanted Posters a bit – players who have unlocked the Battle Pass now get some extra flair to show off their Battle Pass level. Take care and see you in White Spire! GENERAL Fixed an issue with the Play Again button on the post match screen not taking you back to the main menu to queue up. Fixed a bug with later rounds in some Streetfights where enemy units wouldn't get their star upgrades, leading to those fights finally being at their designed difficulty.

Fixed an issue with Underlord face morphs on low-memory devices. Improved reward popup queuing. Improved clock synchronization between client and server during rounds.

With Season 1, Underlords will introduce new content with City Crawl, new rewards with a full Battlepass, and a new meta with a Hero / Item rotation. Oh, and we have a date - Dota Underlords Season 1 is shipping February 25th. Also, keep an eye out for February's PC Gamer. They're running a cover story on the upcoming Underlords release and will have more information about Season 1 (as well as some behind the scenes info about the game's development). {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/4a987f8c927bea4fdf9d11c3bb2e4b172e99219c.jpg Apart from that, things will be pretty quiet on the update front until we ship. We'll be sharing more about Season 1 in the coming weeks though, so stay tuned. And now, we'd like you to meet our little friend: INTRODUCING ENNO Most visitors to White Spire see the refuse-filled alleyways that make up The Warrens as merely slums...but to Enno, it is a Kingdom. Today, his people live in the margins of White Spire; scavenging and stealing to get by, but Enno has bigger aspirations. He believes it’s his destiny to lead his people out of the shadows into greatness, and he will employ every underhanded tactic he can think of in order to make that dream a reality. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/87802210e9f5415f366c352d1739b74ad57cb9f7.png Enno is always on the move - darting around and poisoning enemies with ranged attacks. If he's ever in a pinch he pulls the ripcord and escapes the board for a breather, before coming back and stunning adjacent enemies. Depending on what mood you catch him in Enno employs different ""tactics"". Sometimes Enno will steal items from the enemy crew, while healing his own crew. Other times he'll amp up his own damage and pull the enemy crew in for an all out attack. For more on Enno, check out this Enno sized website we made just for him. PATCH NOTES: Added Enno A ranged menace, Enno leaps around the board poisoning enemies and generally wreaking havoc. Enno will be one of the four Underlord options available at the end of Round 1 in Knockout and at the end of Round 9 in Standard and Duos game modes. One of two Enno builds (detailed below) will be randomly presented. Passive Skill - Escape Artist Once per combat, when dropping below 25/50/75% health, Enno escapes in a cloud of smoke, reappearing elsewhere on the board, stunning adjacent enemies for 1.5 seconds. Build 1 - Healin' n' Stealin'! Dr. Enno's Soothing Balm: Enno leaps into the air and shoots a poison dart at up to 2-5 enemies that are within 3 cells, applying a stack of Poison and healing adjacent allies for 15-60 per stack. Yoink!: Enno steals the lowest tier item from the enemy crew at the start of combat. Whenever an enemy dies in Enno's attack range, he loots them if they have a better item equipped. All items return to their original owners at the end of combat. Build 2 - Rabid Furball Death Spin: Enno leaps into the air and shoots a poison dart at up to 2-5 enemies that are within 3 cells, applying a stack of Poison and dealing 20-55 physical damage per stack. All Out Attack!: Enno lassos the enemy team and launches an All Out Attack! dealing 50-225 physical damage, applying 5 stacks of Poison and displacing them into a random cell. POISON Added a new status effect, Poisoned. Poisoned units take 15 physical damage per second and healing is reduced by 10% for 5 seconds. Poison effects can stack up to 5 times. GENERAL CHANGES Improved lighting used by the Underlords. Fixed issues with low resolution textures on the Underlords on mobile. Further fixes to the map not loading when starting a match. Fixed an issue where a dead unit on a cell could prevent a live unit from being selected. Fixed wrong rank icon sometimes being displayed on the post-match screen. Fixed more places where an Underlord's base ability icon or name would be shown, rather than the version of that ability used by the Underlord build. Added more pizzazz to the Underlord picker.

1046930,Dota Underlords and the autobattler genre is struggling to keep players,"Few realised at the time, but last January we witnessed the birth of a genre. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-auto-chess/"">Dota Auto Chess</a> shot to the top of Dota 2&#8217;s custom games, enticing MOBA players with wizarding army management. The big names took notice. By June we had Riot&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/teamfight-tactics/"">Teamfight Tactics</a> and Valve&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-underlords/"">Dota Underlords</a>, squaring off against each other. An unknown number of millions flocked to TFT, while Dunderlords hit 200,000 peak concurrent players. Six months later, Teamfight Tactics seems relatively stable, while Dota Underlords is dropping fast. We normally don&#8217;t pay player numbers much heed, but given autobattlers were last year&#8217;s big new genre and Dota and League Of Legends are both long-term titans, it&#8217;s hard not to ask the question: how come? <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/01/15/dota-underlords-and-the-autobattler-genre-is-struggling-to-keep-players/#more-774823"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1579095009,

They say all this in <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1696102156440335798"">their post about yesterday&#8217;s update</a>, a smaller affair aimed at reducing misclicks, fixing bugs, and delivering the usual round of balance tweaks. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/01/10/dota-underlords-tunnels-out-of-early-access-in-february/#more-773933"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1578661012,
1046930,Dota Underlords is leaving Early Access in February,"This week&apos;s <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords/"" target=""_blank"">Dota Underlords</a> update was accompanied by the news that it&apos;s almost broken free of Early Access and will soon hit 1.0. It launched on Steam back in June, and in February the first season will officially kick off.&#xA0; It&apos;s not a moment too soon, as Valve&apos;s auto battler has been <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords-peak-player-count-has-dropped-by-more-than-90-percent/"" target=""_blank"">losing traction</a>. Initially it boasted a player count that was double Artifact&apos;s at its peak, but it&apos;s steadily been declining, now down by around 90 percent, and so far has shown no signs of plateauing. No update has managed to move the needle significantly, but the 1.0 update should get a bit more attention.&#xA0; There&apos;s only one more update to go before the milestone, along with some balance tweaks and fixes, and one more Underlord.

1046930,"Happy New Year, White Spire!","Hello Underlords, happy new year! Before we get to today's Update, some words: New year, new you, and coming soon – new season. That’s right, the Beta Season is nearing its end, and Underlords Season 1 will ship by the end of February. In addition to our standard bug / balance patches, we’ll probably have one more update before the big ship date - one more Underlord to round the game out. Otherwise the team will be heads down working on Season 1. This includes work on the Battlepass, City Crawl, Hero / Item rotation, and UI updates. We’ve said it before, but we want to thank you all again for playing with us during this beta / early access period. The community’s support and feedback has been invaluable to getting the game to where it is. We’re in the home stretch and are excited to ship Underlords 1.0 soon - and get the word out to a wider audience. And now, this week's update: GENERAL To prevent misclicks/mistaps, block input for 1 second when the Underlord-chooser UI appears during the game. Fixed an issue with Freestyle item list where items assigned to enemy units would be highlighted as if they were unassigned. More FX improvement and optimization. Enthralled units now get full healthbars, not summon-unit healthbars. Fixed an issue where ranked mode could stay locked when returning to the main menu after completing your last required unranked game. UNDERLORD CHANGES Anessix: Damage Support: The End of Medicine: Self damage on cast changed from 20% to 0. Enthrall: armor reduction changed from 5 to 10. When Anessix casts Enthrall and targets an enemy unit, and friendly units run to attack it, if a friendly unit must move more than 2 cells to attack the new target, it will disregard the new target and keep its old target. Healing Support: Rejuvenating Ritual: Self damage on cast changed from 20% to 5%. Summon Demonic Golem: The golem will now stun nearby enemies 0.25 seconds after it lands. This will prevent one golem disrupting the summoning of the opponent's golem. Anessix's Golem: Fixed a bug with the attack damage stats, they were not converted over properly from the old base-plus-talent version of Golem to the new scaling system in the Jull update when the Golem's health was. Attack Damage Minimum changed from to Attack Damage Maximum changed from to Hobgen: Support Damage Dealer: Let's Go Crazy: Attack Speed Bonus changed from to Jull: Aggressive Tank: Barrels of Fun: the barrels now ignore Spiderlings.

Viper: Maximum Mana changed from 50 to 70 Nethertoxin: Cooldown changed from 5 to 6 Mana Cost changed from 50 to 70 ITEM CHANGES Battle Fury: Bonus Attack Damage changed from 35 to 50 Fixed an interaction with Ember Spirit's ability Sleight of Fist where Battle Fury could cleave damage to 4 additional targets, rather than 2, on each Fist hit. Scythe of Vyse: Fixed an issue where Scythe could waste its charge on an un-piggable enemy.

Black King Bar can now trigger while the unit which has it equipped is casting its own ability. Fixed some cases where magic-immune units could still be stunned or damaged (Hobgen - Explosivo stun, Delta Slam - affecting magic-immune and invulnerable units). Fixed a pathfinding issue where a unit would want to move to an adjacent beneficial cell, but the cell was not free, so the unit ended up not doing anything.

1046930,Dota Underlords' peak player count has dropped by more than 90 percent,"<a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords/"" target=""_blank"">Dota Underlords</a>, Valve&apos;s Early Access auto battler, has shed most of its players in the six months since it launched on Steam. In June, it peaked with more than 200,000 people playing concurrently, according to <a href=""https://steamcharts.com/app/1046930#48h"" target=""_blank"">Steam Charts</a>, but in the last day it&apos;s had fewer than 15,000.&#xA0; Spotted by Reddit user <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ekfmay/half_a_year_after_its_release_daily_peaks_for/"" target=""_blank"">SharkyIzrod</a>, the average player number has dwindled to just over 11,000, with peak players below 20,000. When Underlords launched, auto battlers seemed like the thing to watch, but interest in the genre as a whole seems to have sunk considerably since.&#xA0; The number has been dropping consistently every month, so it doesn&apos;t look like updates have tempted players to return yet. Recent Steam reviews are still mostly positive, however, so it doesn&apos;t look like widespread dissatisfaction is the cause.&#xA0; It calls to mind Artifact&apos;s troubles, unfortunately, which Valve ended up pausing and now averages around 100 players. In that case, however, the exodus was more immediate and severe, and Underlords isn&apos;t quite there yet&#x2014;the player count hasn&apos;t settled, though. Riot&apos;s auto battler bid, Teamfight Tactics, seemed to be doing a lot better the last time the company announced figures. In September, it apparently had a monthly player base of 33 million. It seems here to stay, then, but the future of the genre itself seems a lot less certain.&#xA0; Though the dip is less pronounced, Dota 2 also had a relatively saggy month. The first half of 2019 saw it get close to returning of the highs of 2015 and 2016, but over the last 30 days it&apos;s dropped to the lowest its been since 2014, with an average of 393,589 players and a peak of 627,790.&#xA0; ",1578324751,
1046930,The Update In Which Friendly Fire Gets Even Less Friendly,"GENERAL Draws no longer grant a free reroll. Fixed Assassins being stuck trying to attack a target they can't reach. Fixed an issue where being interrupted during an attack could result in starting a new attack without waiting for the old attack to finish its swing timer. Fixed units with high attack speed waiting too long for their next attack if they switched targets. Fixed incorrect cooldown display causing some Ultimates to look ready when they were not (e.g. Friendly Fire). UNDERLORD CHANGES Anessix Summon Golem: Sped up spawn animation now that the Golem can only crash into the battlefield. Hobgen: Friendly Fire: Fixed an issue where Friendly Fire could cause no damage. Damage changed from to Jull: Fixed Aggressive Tank Jull healing enemies. Happy Hour: Fixed not properly reducing damage. Duration changed from 7.0 to 10.0 Instant damage taken changed from 30 to 50 HERO CHANGES Shadow Demon: Demonic Purge: Fixed not having a cast animation.

That could cause another unit to spawn in or occupy the cell while the Sceptered unit was still in the air. Maelstrom Damage now reduced by 20% each lightning leap, so only the first target hit each cast takes full damage. Vladmir's Offering: Tier changed from 3 to 4.

1046930,Jull-tide Greetings,"Happy Holidays Underlords! Some big changes and updates for you all today - we're introducing a new Underlord, bringing in a new rotation of items, and making some significant gameplay changes. There is a bunch to cover, so let's get into it. As always, if you prefer your updates in bullet point form, go check out the patch notes. INTRODUCING JULL The proprietor of the infamous “Sundered Moon”, Jull is a businessman first and a criminal second. Did he break a few legs to get to where he is? Yes. Does he run a massive smuggling operation to ensure that his bar is stocked with the fine beverages that Icewrack is renowned for? Of course. But while Jull has little interest in following the law, he takes great pride in honoring his word. In the wake of Mama Eeb’s death, he feels like he alone has the temperament and strength to restore order to the criminal underworld of White Spire. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/e4ee6798e8586e81e31f584f1843d0ce66cd34ec.png Jull leads by example, and prefers to get his paws dirty with powerful melee attacks on the front line. When things get tough Jull uses his bootlegged wares to gain an edge… either by rolling barrels into enemies, or by raising his glass to inspire his crew. UPDATED ITEMS With this update, the item roster has also been revamped. Many old standbys have been shelved (though you may be seeing them again in the future) while others have been pulled out of storage. New items like Crystalys, Butterfly, and Horn of the Alpha can now be equipped to buff your crew and defeat your opponents. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/027ef74ccdb0503f4dd96f92b91995b60682c0e7.png GAMEPLAY UPDATES Over the course of our Beta season, we’ve worked to continuously experiment, learn, iterate, and improve the game. The time since our last Big Update has been no different, and with this update we have made some significant changes based on community feedback, as well as what we've internally learned and tested. NEW UNDERLORD SELECTION FLOW Underlords are now picked at Round 10 instead of the beginning of the match, and Talents have been converted into fighting styles. Each Underlord has two builds, and one will be shown at random for each Underlord during this pick phase. For example, you may have a choice between Anessix - Healing Support, Hobgen - Support Damage Dealer, and Jull - Aggressive Tank. Full build info can be found in-game and in the patch notes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/232c031b9eb43a0d099c5be5afc71e15f4024e4a.png In Standard and Duos, Underlords are chosen at Round 10, while in Knockout this happens at Round 2. JAILBREAK The Jail system was introduced to solve a few problems - namely to make it easier to combine units with our ever-expanding roster of heroes. While this was accomplished, there were a bunch of unintended side effects. It wreaked havoc on some of our balance tweaks, kept players from playing their favorite heroes and alliances, and many players didn’t enjoy having to check it every day. That's why we've decided to shut down the Rookery and release all of the inmates indefinitely. The heroes that are in the game will always be hire-able in the shop, and players won't have to worry about their favorite Alliances being crippled because of a bad Jail day. That said... UPDATED HERO ROSTER White Spire does still have an overpopulation problem. To solve this, a few heroes have been booted from White Spire (for now...). As we mentioned at the very beginning of our Beta Season, we intend to have a hero rotation every season, and we're getting ready for Season 1 with our first rotation. After plenty of testing and feedback we came up with a slimmed down set of heroes to build your crew with. Not to worry though, you may still be seeing some new and familiar faces when Season 1 ships. For a full list of there heroes taking a break, check out the patch notes. SHORTER STANDARD & DUOS MATCHES We've also made major changes to the Standard and Duos game flows to make the overall games shorter. We've taken what we've learned from Knockout, internal testing, and from our community at large to make games shorter and more fun. To accomplish this, matches are now jump-started with all players at Level 3 with 5 gold. We've removed creeps from the loot rounds and reduced hero HP by 25%. Loot rounds now happen during normal PvP rounds, but your item choices won't be affected by whether you won / lost. The team has been having a great time playing the updated Standard mode, and we've seen a significant decrease in match time - down to an average of thirty minutes. POLISH Last and most definitely not least, the team has put a bunch of time into polishing UI, fixing crashes, optimizing effects, and squishing bugs. For a full breakdown of these changes and all of the other changes listed above, check out the patch notes. That's it for today! Happy holidays, and see you in White Spire! ",1576696071,
1046930,Jull-tide Changelog,"ROUND LENGTH All units have had their health lowered by 25%. Health values are now 1.5x the original values that we shipped with the game initially. Dev Note: We wanted to find a balance between early game and late game survability for our units. Doubling the health was too much, and we think we found a good balance with the new health values. STANDARD / DUOS MODE FLOW CHANGES Starting Unit Cap changed from 1 to 3. Players start with 5 gold. Interest is now capped at 3 (rewarded at a maximum of 30 gold) Round Gold increased from 5 to 7. Creep rounds have been removed. Items are granted every 5 rounds. Item quality does not change if you win or lose the round. Underlords are no longer selected before the game and are now pickable in a new phase later into the match (Round 10 for Standard/Duos, Round 2 for Knockout). Higher tier units now deal more damage to enemy players at the end of a round. Unit damage is now = 1 + (Power Level / 3) 1 star unit Power Level = Tier 2 star unit Power Level = Tier + 2 3 star unit Power Level = Tier + 4 GENERAL CHANGES The Lords of White Spire leaderboard has been updated to support Ranked Knockout and Ranked Duos. https://underlords.com/leaderboard You can now view stats from previous rounds in the post-game scoreboard. You can now view the duos scoreboard on the post-game screen. Knockout tries to avoid giving you the same opponent twice in a row. The multiplier for permanent stat changes in Knockout for e.g. Brawny kills or Legion Commander duels is now 4 instead of 5. UNDERLORDS Underlords have changed based on community feedback. Players don't start the game with an Underlord, instead they are chosen during the match (Round 10 for Standard/Duos, Round 2 for Knockout). Underlords have been streamlined into Fight Styles. Fight Styles contain a Core ability and an Ultimate. Underlords talent selection has been removed. Some of the talents have been merged into the Core Underlord abilities. See individual Underlord sections below. Hype system has been removed. Underlords will cast their abilities on cooldowns. Underlord Core abilities start each round with 50% cooldown remaining. (eg. Anessix's Martyr's Boon has an 8 second cooldown. It will trigger for the first time 4 seconds into the fight.) Ultimate ability cooldowns have been lowered and their power level increased. Anessix: Martyr's Boon: Anessix takes damage equal to 20% of her max health. All allied units heal hitpoints a second for the next 6 seconds. Cooldown changed from 12.5 to 8 Duration changed from 8 to 6 Healing Support Fighting Style: Martyr's Boon now delivers the first 50% of the heal immediately, and the rest over the duration of the spell. Damage Support Fighting Style: Instead of healing, Martyr's Boon now grants 30% increased attack damage. Pure Pain: Removed from game.

Cooldown changed from 22 to 15 Summon Demonic Golem: Anessix summons a Demonic Golem, crashing behind enemy lines and stunning every enemy within 2 cells for 2 seconds. Granted via Healing Support Fighting Style.

Super-Charged: Removed from game. Let's Go Crazy: Hobgen's attacks now reach the entire battlefield, and your entire army gains increased attack speed. Hobgen will continually switch targets to units that are not on fire. Granted via Support Damage Dealer Fighting Style. No longer silences Hobgen Grants your entire army attack speed. Cooldown changed from 22 to 10 Friendly Fire: Hobgen's buddies throw 8 bombs in the battle field dealing damage to enemies directly hit. Enemies caught in the explosion AoE take half damage. Granted via High Damage Dealer Fighting Style. Cooldown changed from 22 to 15 Jull: !NEW! Shake It Off: Jull reflects 50% of melee damage taken back to all adjacent enemy units, and heals for 30% of melee damage and 15% of ranged damage taken over the last 5 seconds. Aggressive Tank Fighting Style: The reflected damage is now delivered over 8 seconds instead of instantly, but deals twice as much damage. Healing Tank Fighting Style: Damage is also converted to healing split evenly to adjacent friendlies. Cooldown: 10 seconds. Barrels of Fun: Jull calls in barrels from the edges of the board. If they hit an ally, they gain 50 attack speed. If they hit an enemy, they take physical damage and receive 20% more magical and physical damage for the rest of the fight.

1046930,Dota adds two new heroes with the Outlanders Updates today,"<a href=""https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/11/dota-2-snapfire.jpg""> </a> A lizard-riding auntie with a shotgun and an incarnation of aether today arrived in <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-2/"">Dota 2</a> and <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-underlords/"">Dota Underlords</a> in matching Outlanders Updates. Snapfire and Void Spirit are the two new heroes announced at The International in August, and here they are in both games now. They&#8217;re accompanied by big updates for each, with Dota 2 adding new buildings and dozens of new items and Underlords adding a new quick-paced mode plus the other Spirit heroes. These patch notes sure are a lot to take in. Damn, Dota. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/11/26/dota-adds-two-new-heroes-with-the-outlanders-updates-today/#more-761901"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1574795976,
1046930,The Outlanders Update,"We are updating Underlords today with the Outlanders, a new Alliance, a speedy game mode, a new new player experience, and a partridge in a pear tree. If you'd like to see the pretty version of these update notes, check out our sparkly Outlanders website. Let’s get started, shall we? The Outlanders and the Spirit Alliance White Spire has five new heroes in town, and the Underlords can't wait to get them fighting for their crews. Snapfire and Void Spirit are new to both Dota 2 and Underlords, while the three Spirits are just tagging along to keep their long lost Spirit cousin company. Snapfire - Snapfire is a Dragon Inventor. She provides ranged support for the crew and will periodically fire a shotgun blast and slow enemy attack rate. If the Dragon Alliance is active, her lizard mount fires globs of fire at the enemy. Void Spirit - Void Spirit is a Spirit Warlock and is the Ace of Spirits. He is a melee attacker and his Dissimilate ability allows him to create portals and perform sneak attacks on opponents. Void Spirit’s Ace ability makes charged Spirits deal 100% more damage. Spirit Alliance - Void Spirit didn’t head to White Spire on his own. He brought a few cousins with him: Storm Spirit, Ember Spirit, and Earth Spirit. When three of the spirits are on the board together and charged, they fire off the Triangular Delta Slam. This damages all enemy heroes within and applies each spirit’s elemental effects. Knockout Mode We’ve added a new fast-paced game mode called Knockout. In Knockout, every player begins by choosing a starting crew of 5 heroes. It only takes two heroes to combine, and players level up automatically every other round. Each player has 4 strikes (losses) before they get knocked out and games last an average of 10 minutes. Players are matched up in a pseudo bracket and will only be fighting against other players with the same or similar health. Full game rules in the patch notes below. We are starting with Knockout Casual and will soon be adding Ranked. And of course we taught our bots how to play Knockout, so players will be able to get some quick bot games in. The team has been having way too much fun playtesting this internally and we’re excited to get in the queue with the rest of the community! New Player Experience As we get closer to shipping Season 1, we want to make sure the onboarding flow is as smooth as possible for new Underlords. With this update we’ve added a new tutorial in which Ricky Ravenhook quickly teaches new players the basic concepts in Underlords. This tutorial only gets triggered for players who have played less than three games of Underlords and only shows up once. If you’d like to run the tutorial manually, it can be found as a game mode under “Bot Match”. Mobile UI The team continues to make updates and improvements to the in-game UI. This update comes with a significant design pass to the both PC and Mobile UI, making things more legible, tappable / clickable, and visually balanced for all players regardless of device. This work is ongoing, and we look forward to hearing your feedback. Full Patch Notes GENERAL Updated new player experience - tutorial starts automatically for players who have played less than three games of Underlords. Significant design pass to the both PC and Mobile UI, making things more legible, tappable / clickable, and visually balanced. The Janitor took off some time from a busy Dota update to sweep out more crashes. Added many more 2-star and 3-star visual upgrades for heroes. Improved queue times for parties. KNOCKOUT New game mode, available for bots and for casual online matches. At the beginning of the game, choose from three starter crews of five heroes, drawn from two Alliances. These two Alliances will be completed to the first tier. Don't like your three choices? You get one reroll. Players start at level 5 and automatically level up on even rounds. Players get to choose an item on odd rounds and on the starter-crew round. Only two of the same hero are needed to rank up. Only one Underlord Talent is pickable (the Ultimate). Four strikes (losses) and you’re out. Round pairs are made based on player health - players with the same or similar health will be matched up when possible. No interest on your bank and no extra gold from streaks. Average 10 minute games. HERO CHANGES Earth Spirit: Newly added. Alliances: Spirit Warrior Tier: 3 Ability: Geomagnetic Grip - Earth Spirit summons a Stone Remnant off the map and pulls it towards his current target. Enemies struck by the incoming Stone Remnant are silenced for 3 seconds and take damage.

Primordial: Eidolon: Armor changed from to ",1574373285,
1046930,The Update In Which We All Grow Together,"GENERAL Memory usage improvements. The Crash Police put some crashes in jail. Chickens were involved, for sure. Anessix VO improvements. You'll be hearing a bit less about the Court of Ristul now, too, from both of them. Fixed some sounds like Io's Tether and Crystal Maiden's Frostbite not persisting while the ability lasted. Improved dragging on mobile. Dead players will no longer have Underlord talents selected for them. Stay dead! The bots once again had their shiny metal heads unscrewed and more Smartness inserted. UI improvements for where the smaller item icons are displayed. Party UI improvements. Healthbars now only show stars for 2 and 3-star units. GAMEPLAY Spiderlings now die as soon as they take any damage whatsoever. Previously, HP-based damage would take many seconds to kill them. Spiderlings no longer have Alliance buffs applied to them, with the exception of Troll since it affects attack speed. Fixed an issue where Assassins would not jump if they had a castable item equipped. Round Damage is back, at 1 per every 10 rounds of the game, e.g. 1 per round at 10-19, 2 at 20-29, etc. JAIL While the jail concept succeeded at keeping the game fresher day after day, our initial implementation made it so certain alliances were overly punished (Scrappies/Inventors) while some others (Assassins) where virtually unaffected most of the time. In order to address some of these problems we are changing the jail algorithm a little bit: Every day 8 to 12 heroes are jailed. Up to 3 heroes from a single alliance can be banned. This means that some days certain alliances won’t be fully completable (this will be displayed in the ingame alliance UI) One Ace will be jailed every day. Heroes from Tiers 1-4 can no longer have more than 1 unit banned over other tiers, for example if there’s 10 jailed heroes, the Jail might might look like this: Tier 1: Two bans Tier 2: Three bans Tier 3: Two bans Tier 4: Two bans Tier 5: One ban (as always). Additionally, some units have changed alliances, which will make the impact more even across different alliances. We look forward to hearing what you think. UNDERLORD CHANGES Rank is no longer tied to Player Level. All Underlords in the game grow steadily in power throughout the game on the same schedule. At their maximum power, they are equivalent to the old version's Rank 8. Underlords no longer require Hype to cast abilities. Abilities start on cooldown and will be cast every time their cooldowns are ready. Hype now increases your Underlord's damage (up to +50% max Total Damage at full Hype) and how fast their cooldowns tick (up to 40% faster at full Hype). Ultimate abilities can now only be cast once. We thought it was time to try a different approach to Underlords. One thing we agreed strongly on was that they were overshadowing our Hero units, with the Underlords' actions (or lack thereof) changing the direction of combat too wildly. We also didn't like how hard it skewed leveling vs rolling: spending gold on XP was the clear choice most of the time. With better units in the shop, space for an extra unit on the board, and greater Underlord power, Team Rolling never had a chance. Thank you for letting us experiment on you with all these changes! Anessix: Passive Ability: Passive Hype generation changed from 1.8 to 1.5 Hype per Demon changed from 0.72 to 1.0 Martyr's Boon: Cooldown changed from 15 to 12.5 Heal per level changed from 10 to 11 No longer targets Spiderlings.

They now again have the numbers we mentioned felt good to us in our internal testing (4/8/15 per level of alliance rather than 7/15/25). Hobgen Super-Charged: Hype cost lowered 50->40. Hobgen: passive hype generation 1.5->1.65, hype generation from units on fire increased 0.75->0.95. Anessix: lowered armor and health on archer. Change to Underlord casting: If more than one ability is ready to cast an Underlord will choose their ultimate in preference to a regular ability. Fixed an issue where Outlines couldn't be disabled on mobile. Minor UI fixes. Made the talent browser swipable. Bot matches no longer start paused by default. Fixed an issue with the Friendly Fire FX. Fixed missing FX for daily challenge reward claim. Fixed missing mention of health regeneration on Hood of Defiance. It's 10HP/sec. Doom's Doom description clarified to say it Breaks. This hotfix is now live on PC and our servers (so multiplayer games will have the gameplay changes), but will roll out on mobile devices as it is approved.",1571956837,['patchnotes']
1046930,Dota Underlords has finally added Underlords,"<a href=""https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/10/dota-underlords.jpg""> </a> The Underlords of <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-underlords/"">Dota Underlords</a> are no longer a naming flourish, today becoming actual units leading our armies with handy perks and abilities. Valve name today&#8217;s update <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1654436877747356677"">The Big Update</a> because, well, it is. Along with the first two Underlords, it adds new heroes from Dota 2 and new Alliances with new bonuses. A Duos mode has arrived too, with teams who can play on separate boards but can give heroes and gold &#8211; and share a life total. Things. Lots of things. A big update.

1046930,Dota Underlords' 'Big Update' goes live with new heroes and a Duos mode,"The Big Update has finally gone live in Valve&apos;s autobattler <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords/"" target=""_blank"">Dota Underlords</a>, meaning that the Underlords themselves, Anessix and Hobgen, have now joined the fight. Players will select an Underlord at the beginning of each match to lead their team with abilities and buffs that will grow stronger as they play. The Underlords&#x2014;<a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1566616051187022659"" target=""_blank"">Hobgen</a>, a fairy arsonist who relies on fire-based ranged attacks and grows in power as he sets enemies on fire, and <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1654436877741746158"" target=""_blank"">Anessix</a>, the Mistress of Secrets, who summons demons to fight on her behalf and can cast healing buffs on her crew and curses on her opponents&#x2014;each have a set of 22 unique talents, half of which are locked by default. Playing the game unlocks the rest of their talents, which can modify their abilities &quot;in powerful and unique ways.&quot; Underlord abilities are powered by a resource called Hype that&apos;s generated both passively and by killing enemy units&#x2014;and also each other. Underlords are powerful but they&apos;re not immortal, and if an Underlord is killed in battle their counterpart becomes &quot;empowered&quot; and will earn double Hype for the rest of the fight. The update also brings in a new Duos game mode that pits eight teams of two against one other in tag-team throwdowns. Each team member will hire and level their own crews but will be able to help out their partners by sending them gold and heroes, and teamwork will be essential: Health and levels are shared, so ignoring your partner&apos;s woes to focus on your own probably won&apos;t get you too far. Duos will debut with Casual matchmaking, while Ranked Duos mode is expected to go live soon. Freestyle is another new Underlords mode that will give players the ability to set up and execute scenarios to see how strategies will play out or how different heroes will fare under particular conditions. (If you&apos;re curious what happens when you make a bunch of Potatoes fight a bunch of Tomatoes, for instance, now you can find out.) There are new alliance options for Insects, Healers, Brutes, and Champions, 12 new heroes available to hire, and because there are now so many heroes to choose from, the Jail, which will hold a random selection of 8-12 heroes, updated daily, who thus cannot be hired&#x2014;although all alliances can still be fully completed, even in their absence. The update also makes some big changes to the interface, including the dashboard and notifications, adds new voice lines to most of the game&apos;s heroes, and makes the usual array of bug fixes and balance tweaks. It is, as the name suggests, a Big Update. The full patch notes are available <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1654436877744268905"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. ",1571947135,
1046930,The Big Update,"Hello! The day has finally arrived and The Big Update is here. There’s a bunch of stuff to get through – and this post will just be covering the highlights. If you’re the type of person who likes to know all the nitty gritty details, you can check out the patch notes here. Without further ado, here’s what’s new in The Big Update. {STEAM_CLAN_LOC_IMAGE}/35233241/4e5bfa5e7e3ca48bf6ab7f566c472f1dc2b0fbe8.png The Underlords Have Arrived The Underlords (as in the folks we named the game after) have finally joined the fray after watching on the sidelines for months. Before every match you’ll choose an Underlord to lead your crew. They’ll fight alongside your heroes, fire off abilities, provide buffs, and grow stronger throughout each match. Each Underlord has their own set of unique Talents that can be picked as the match progresses – these talents improve and unlock your abilities. Anessix and Hobgen have a total of 22 Talents each, and 11 are locked by default. Play games (bot games count) to unlock and discover the rest of the Talents available to you. For more information about Underlords, see our previous posts about the Underlords, Hobgen, and Anessix. You’ll also be able to read about them in-game. {STEAM_CLAN_LOC_IMAGE}/35233241/f82475d142cbfac9d689c51aa6f54466a79eb850.png Duos Mode – Battle with Your Buddies With this update we are adding a new social game mode – Duos. In this game mode you’ll party up with a friend and queue up with seven other teams of two (16 players total, if you were counting). You and your teammate will each be hiring and leveling your own crews, but now you’ll be able to help each other out by sending gold and heroes to each other. Watch out though, your health is also shared, as is your level. Battle is fought in pairs against other teams, and round damage is summed up. We are launching Duos with Casual matchmaking with plans to ship a Ranked Duos mode soon. {STEAM_CLAN_LOC_IMAGE}/35233241/6ca698cd54afe8dc544053c2c6f39de5b1cea51b.png Freestyle Mode – The Board is Your Test Lab We’ve also added a new mode we’re calling Freestyle. With Freestyle mode you can quickly set up and test different scenarios. Maybe you want to test out different theories for your own strategies, or maybe you want to put a new hero through its paces to learn what they do and how they fight in a battle. Or if you’re like us you just want to see who would win between 32 Tomatoes and 32 Potatoes (Potatoes by a mile). {STEAM_CLAN_LOC_IMAGE}/35233241/7999aeea478702872846528f1e53d7fe09033d97.png New Heroes for Hire, and New Alliances to Form Insects, Healers, Brute, and Champion Alliances can now be formed, and favorite Heroes like Faceless Void, Io, Broodmother and Legion Commander are now for hire in the shop. In total, 12 Heroes have been added to the roster, filling out the new Alliances and padding a few of the existing ones. The team has also made a host of balance and gameplay updates to the rest of the Underlords roster, so head over to the patch notes for details if you’re curious. {STEAM_CLAN_LOC_IMAGE}/35233241/5af3574c7bcd53657a5a625724cbdf2468268513.png Too Many Heroes? Introducing JAIL You may be asking yourself “Wow, that’s a ton of new heroes. How am I ever going to get anyone to Rank 3 in a match?” We hear you, and the local law enforcement of White Spire also hear you. A random group of 8-12 heroes will now be detained in The Rookery for a day, and this group will update every day. To see who’s in jail, and what they’re in there for, we’ve added jail buttons to the dashboard, the game-start panel, and the Shop. Not to worry though – even though these heroes are in jail, all Alliances can still be fully completed. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/0826aee7a90fa245323f1dcdbaa85f01fb2bac4e.png New UI. So Fresh, So Clean Meanwhile, the team has been overhauling our PC and Mobile user interfaces. From the new Dashboard (lovingly referred to internally as the Beautiful Corner), to the new notification message system (all yo-able of course), to the new full-featured in-game PC UI - we’ve worked hard to give the whole experience an upgrade. This is all in addition to the new interfaces to help you communicate with your Duos partner, set up experiments in Freestyle mode, pick Talents for your new Underlord, and all of the other new features that have been added in this Big Update. A Note About Ranks When this update rolls out, ranked play will be disabled for a few hours as we watch to make sure things are stable. Once we set ranked live, player ranks will be compressed a bit as part of the new update. Try to beat your previous record, or be the first to climb back to Lord of Whitespire. And that’s all!

1046930,The Big Changelog,"With The Big Update, Underlords takes a large step forward as we move closer to the end of the Beta Season and the beginning of Season 1. So what is included in the appropriately named Big Update? We're so glad you asked... NEW MODES DUOS Team up with a partner in crime to battle 7 other teams in an effort to be the last pair standing. You share a health pool with your buddy and can freely trade heroes and gold with them. Currently, to queue up for Duos you will need to form a party with a friend. FREESTYLE Create any combat scenario that you want and watch it play out in a custom sandbox. You can easily share the board that you've set up with others. GENERAL GAMEPLAY JAIL Every 24 hours a small number of heroes are detained in The Rookery. These heroes won't be available in-game until they're released the next day. All Alliances can still be completed even with these absences. XP XP is now advanced in increments of 5 instead of increments of 4. Each click of the XP wheel now spends 5 gold to gain 5 XP. The XP curve has been adjusted to compensate: OLD XP CURVE Level 1 - 0 Level 2 - 1 Level 3 - 2 Level 4 - 4 Level 5 - 8 Level 6 - 16 Level 7 - 32 Level 8 - 56 Level 9 - 88 Level 10 - 128 NEW XP CURVE Level 1 - 0 Level 2 - 1 Level 3 - 2 Level 4 - 5 Level 5 - 10 Level 6 - 20 Level 7 - 40 Level 8 - 65 Level 9 - 100 Level 10 - 150 ITEM DROPS The table for item drops from Wave 30 and beyond has been adjusted.

That's it. That's this entire section. Just a ton of updates to the UI. Like a lot. HERO VOICE LINES White Spire got a lot more chatty. Almost every hero in Underlords has received a ton of voice lines, with the remaining few on the way! UNDERLORDS Starting with The Big Update you'll be able to pick either Hobgen or Anessix to be your Underlord. Underlords are powerful units that are the centerpiece of your crew. You'll be able to modify them throughout the game to fit your current crew by selecting Talents every 5 rounds starting at round 10. Underlord Talents modify their abilities in powerful and unique ways. Be careful though, Underlords are not immortal, and can be killed in combat each round. Hype Hype is required to power each of your Underlord's abilities. Each Underlord generates passive Hype in a unique way. Every time an Underlord kills a unit they gain 10 Hype. If an Underlord is Stunned or Hexed they lose 5 hype per seconds while under those effects. When the enemy Underlord is killed your Underlord is empowered and gains twice as much Hype for the rest of the fight. Hype is not consumed when an Underlord casts an ability. Underlord Abilities As long as your Underlord's Hype is above the threshold for an ability then your Underlord will cast it whenever it is ready. Each ability has its own separate cooldown. Trash Talk Each Underlord comes with their own unique set of taunts for both the preparation phase (which go out to all players), as well as the combat phase (which will only be heard by your current opponent). NEW HEROES Nyx Assassin: Alliances: Insect Assassin Tier: 1 Ability: Spiked Carapace - Nyx Assassin pops spikes out of its carapace, negating and reflecting 100% of the damage dealt (max once from each source), as well as stunning the source of the damage for s. (100 mana, 10s cooldown) Ability: Vendetta - PASSIVE: After teleporting to attack a unit, Nyx Assassin deals 200 bonus damage on his next attack and applies Break to the enemy for 4s, disabling all passive effects. Shadow Demon: Alliances: Heartless Demon Tier: 1 Ability: Demonic Purge - Repeatedly purges the target enemy unit, removing positive buffs, applying Break, and slowing the target for 5 seconds. The unit slowly regains its movement/attack speed until the end of the duration, upon which damage is dealt. (100 mana, s cooldown) Dazzle: Alliances: Troll Healer Tier: 2 Ability: Shadow Wave - Dazzle sends out a bolt of power that arcs between up to allies that are 3 cells apart, healing each ally for while damaging any enemy units 1 cell away for .

1046930,The Big Update Preview Part Seven – Introducing Anessix,"Hello friends, we are back again for one more installment of The Big Update Preview Series™. Today we will be introducing Anessix, the Mistress of Secrets – the other Underlord who will be joining us as part of the Big Update. Anessix summons a demon companion to attack her enemies on her behalf. After all, why do the dirty work yourself when you can just command a sidekick to do it for you? That said, she’s no mere bystander – Anessix also casts healing buffs for her crew and curses her opponents. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/7a61cd6920207c46456d0fa8defcb20a5a298a1d.png Like Hobgen, Anessix comes with her own set of unique talents. They can make her companion beefier, buffs buffier, and curses cursier. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/bdb59626ab53921a4c7e6c97972d1ec1d0461db1.png And that’s it for today. But no more updates though.

1046930,The Big Update Preview Part Six – Introducing Hobgen,"We’re in the home stretch now. Today we’re covering Underlords and revealing one of the first Underlords to hit the streets of White Spire. After months of watching the beta season from the sidelines, the Underlords are finally ready to join the battle. They fight alongside their crew, and each Underlord brings their own unique set of perks and abilities to support the team. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/b2bce75da9556f4637e20cf4aefb99bd29556c2a.png The first Underlord we’re introducing is Hobgen, a fairy who also happens to be an arsonist.

1046930,The Big Update Preview Part Five - Duos & Freestyle Mode,"Today we'll be taking a look at 2 new modes that are part of The Big Update. First off, Duos.

1046930,Dota Underlords is going to throw some heroes in jail every day,"Valve has provided <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1566616051178853367"" target=""_blank"">more information</a> on the &quot;<a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords-has-new-alliances-and-heroes-planned-for-its-next-big-update/"">Big Update</a>&quot; coming to Dota Underlords in the near future. Along with another selection of heroes drawn from the Dota 2 roster, the game will be adding a system to keep the hero pool from overflowing. Specifically, it&apos;ll be throwing some of them in jail. Here&apos;s how (and why) it works. As the hero pool expands, it becomes harder and harder to rank up the heroes you&apos;ve purchased from the shop, since the odds of finding matches for heroes on your bench get reduced each time a new hero is added to the general pool. Valve says it doesn&apos;t plan on removing any of the heroes that have appeared in the beta season, and so when season one kicks in and adds 12 new heroes to the pool, some of them will get tossed in jail for 24 hours. Each day, a different group of 8-12 heroes will be jailed, effectively banning them from appearing in the shop. This won&apos;t be completely random: Valve says that the list of jailed heroes for each day will be created such that players can still complete every alliance. A nice added benefit of this system is that it prevents an established meta from taking hold and making the game feel stale. You&apos;re going to be faced with different composition options each day. Valve <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1566616051175863949"" target=""_blank"">also revealed</a> the rest of the heroes who will be appearing in the Big Update. They include Shadow Demon (a tier one heartless demon), Bristleback (a tier four brawny savage), Sven (the ace of knights, who is also human and scaled), Io (a tier three primordial druid), and Faceless Void (primordial and the ace of assassins).&#xA0; There&apos;s still no word on precisely when the Big Update will drop, but&#xA0;judging from the way Valve&apos;s talking about it, it&apos;ll be sooner rather than later.

1046930,Dota Underlords is adding prison,"I presumed <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-underlords/"">Dota Underlords</a> was already set in some sort of dungeon, so it pleases me that Valve will soon add an additional prison. This is just one part of <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/09/13/dota-underlords-adding-duos-mode-and-actual-underlords/"">the upcoming Big Update</a>, which will add a buncha new heroes while substantially changing how the game works. Valve will be jailing 8-12 random heroes each day in an attempt to keep things fresh, but ensuring that all alliances can still be completed. It sounds like a neat way of keeping people on their toes, and makes the job of anyone writing guides for this often inscrutable auto-battler even harder. My thoughts are with Ollie in this trying time. On closer inspection Dunderlords takes place in an underground town, and my prejudices clearly need to be kept in check. Let us look at these upcoming heroes with the respect they are due. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/21/dota-underlords-is-adding-prison/#more-745915"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1571651369,

You might be asking yourself: ""Won't this make it harder to Rank Up Heroes?"". This is where the Jail comes in: Every 24 hours, a number of crimin Heroes are removed from the pool. This system will also make sure that when creating the list of Heroes to ban, that all Alliances can still be completed. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/5af3574c7bcd53657a5a625724cbdf2468268513.png Not only we have found it adds a great variance to the game from day to day, but most importantly, we didn't see any change to the rate Heroes can be Ranked Up.

1046930,Dota Underlords has new alliances and heroes planned for its next big update,"Valve has <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/1566616051167979215"" target=""_blank"">shared some new details</a> about the next &apos;Big Update&apos; for <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/dota-underlords/"">Dota Underlords</a>, and they weren&apos;t kidding: this one really is big. It&apos;s introducing brand new heroes and alliances, and it apparently marks the &apos;beginning of the end&apos; for the Dota Underlords beta. Heroes in Underlords are getting another reshuffle. Valve has established a new &apos;Healer&apos; alliance, which includes Enchantress, Warlock, Omniknight, Necrophos, and newcomer Dazzle. Dazzle is a tier-two troll healer who can send out a bolt of power that arcs between allies. The energy heals teammates but harms enemies nearby. When the Healer alliance bonus is active, all friendly healing is amplified. Valve also unveiled the forthcoming Insects alliance. Sand King is finally going to have some friends around, in other words. Sand King is joined by new heroes Weaver (tier two insect hunter), Nyx Assassin (tier one insect assassin), and Broodmother (tier four insect warlock). It&apos;ll be interesting to see how all of this shakes out. A couple heroes, Sniper for instance, have three alliance affiliations, so it&apos;s unclear whether heroes like Warlock and Necrophos will be losing one of their existing alliances in order to join the Healer gang. And this may be slightly picky of me, but at least three of the four members of the Insects alliance are arachnids. Maybe to be safe we can just call them &apos;bugs.&apos; Valve says they&apos;ll have more information to share about the Big Update in the days to come. ",1571413309,
1046930,The Big Update Preview - New Heroes & Alliances - Part One,"The Big Update is shipping soon, and we can’t help but start to talk about it. There are many pieces to this update (hence the name) and we’ll be sharing new details daily until release. At a high level, The Big Update marks the beginning of the end of the Underlords Beta. We’ve been constantly learning and experimenting over the last few months, and with this update we are polishing away a big chunk of ‘Beta’, getting us even closer to Version 1.0. We'd like to start our previews by showcasing Heroes and Alliances that make part of the new roster. Let's get started! Introducing the Healer Alliance and Dazzle: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/e91f714574d413d9e05b576a749047727333ee82.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/b78f37b54f6235a68bfbb8520b5a1a824b48f560.png The Insects Alliance is also here ready to bug your opponents, with 3 new heroes Weaver, Nyx Assassin and Broodmother: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/7999aeea478702872846528f1e53d7fe09033d97.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/0d69a981e99142327a4572bb58b10c408946557f.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/f8c9cce9714a914ec042542a2f9e82bf1ba5ad86.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/891f6769118c2dd638846d306b46b291ed7e3239.png We'll continue our showcase of new heroes and alliances tomorrow with Part Two, see ya then.

1046930,We're Channeling a Hotfix,"HOTFIXES Fixed an issue where, once a unit's channeling was interrupted, it could never cast at a higher power than that. This affected Keeper of the Light and Windranger. If their casts were interrupted, any later casts would be at the same power level, even if in the later casts they successfully channeled the entire channel time. Fixed the longstanding issue where more than one of the same type of Demon would still invalidate the Demon alliance. Tweaked Savage numbers to from . In our internal playtests, the game is different enough that the old Savage numbers (and the change to Demons) felt balanced, but public is in a very different space right now so this should work better for the public game.",1570765580,['patchnotes']
1046930,We Can't Bear This Bug Anymore,"NOTE: This is our last update before the Big Update. Next week you won't get a new update, but in exchange--if all goes well--we'll start showcasing each of the new features you'll find in the Big Update as we approach release day. See you then! GENERAL Fixed an issue where units could be forced to attack untargetable units (example: Pudge hooks an undying unit). Fixed an issue where all damage done by Medusa's Ace Effect, where all Scaled units do damage to units near them, would be credited to Medusa only. HERO CHANGES Enchantress: Nature's Attendants: Fixed an issue where the wrong heal amount was displayed on the ability tooltip. Lone Druid's Spirit Bear: Entangling Claws: Fixed an issue where Entangling Claws would never be cast. Viper: Max Mana is now 50. ITEM CHANGES Big-Time Contract: Players can now get more than 1 of this item again. Target Buddy: Can no longer be healed. ALLIANCES Blood-Bound: Changed to: When a Blood-Bound unit dies, it gives +125% Attack Damage, in addition to any existing Blood-Bound bonus it has, to a random friendly Blood-Bound unit. Savage: Changed to: Allied Savage units gain + Attack Damage each time they land an attack on an enemy or cast a damaging spell. This affects Venomancer and Sand King, the only Savage units with damaging spells. ",1570747675,
1046930,"Dota Underlords builds [October] 7 best builds for Knight, Troll, Mage, Savage, and more","<strong>Dota Underlords builds</strong> are wondrously complex and finnicky beasts. Combining your knowledge not just of heroes and abilities and items and alliances, but also the pacing of a match and your relative needs on different rounds can all get pretty mind-boggling pretty quickly &#8211; especially now that you also have to factor in the new Ace Tier heroes and effects with versions #245 and later. So we thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to revisit our <strong>Dota Underlords builds guide</strong> to see what still works and what no longer does. Below we&#8217;ve put together <strong>seven of the very best builds </strong>heading into October, from Knights and Dragons to Savage Trolls, and many more. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/07/dota-underlords-builds-october-7-best-builds-for-knight-troll-mage-savage-and-more/#more-739529"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1570450079,

Just as much as deciding which heroes to use, where to position them, and which items to equip yourself with, your combination of alliances will decide who lives and who dies on the 8&#215;8 battlefield. With all the minor and major updates that have happened to various alliances and heroes recently, we thought it best to go back over our <strong>Dota Underlords alliances </strong><strong>guide</strong> and let you in on which alliances are faring the best overall in the current meta. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/07/dota-underlords-alliances-tier-list-october-the-best-alliances-in-dota-underlords/#more-739531"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1570449954,
1046930,The Update in Which Tusk's Foes Are Brought Back Down To Earth,"GENERAL Removed Summon Units challenge. Fixed an issue where some abilities that preferred the unit's current target (e.g. Slardar's Corrosive Haze) could be cast outside their maximum range. Fixed an issue where Tusk could punch something so hard it never returned to earth. Added a new Notice animation for Tiny. HERO CHANGES Lycan: Shapeshift: Fixed an issue where Lycan was healing too much on shift. Slardar: Corrosive Haze: Will no longer be cast again on a target currently affected by it.

1046930,We're Lycan This Update,"GENERAL Fixed longstanding issue where passive abilities (excepting Dragon special abilities and Sand King's Caustic Finale) used stats from one rank higher, e.g. Crystal Maiden 2-star using Crystal Maiden 3-star's values. Some units got a buff to compensate (see below), and we'll be monitoring the others. A few Bots had their electronic brains unscrewed, tweaked, and reattached. Added some new animations for benched units when under unit cap. Fixed an issue where tiny quantities of damage could generate either too little or too much Mana. Warlock casting Shadow Word would cause this. Fixed a visual-only issue where Lina and Crystal Maiden would return from the dead at the end of combat. With most summons removed (see below), removed the Summoning Stone item. Units killing themselves no longer get those kills scored. Sorry Barricades! HERO CHANGES Axe: Armor changed from 5 to . Maximum Health changed from to . Disruptor: Static Storm: Fixed an issue where total damage dealt could be wrong. No longer gives units in the storm a miss chance.

Venomancer: Removed Plague Ward ability. Added Venomous Gale: Launches a ball of venom in a line, poisoning enemy units so that they take damage as well as damage every 3s for a duration of 15s. Affected units lose 50% movement speed and 25 Attack Rate. Mana Cost: 100. Cooldown: . ",1569541282,
1046930,The Update In Which Mr. Warlock Gets Flashy,"GENERAL 2-star and 3-star visual upgrades for Batrider, Enigma, Slark, Sniper, and Warlock. The janitor took out some more crash trash. Fixed an issue where Terrorblade could Sunder with the wrong unit at cast time, including dead units. Can no longer enter combat preview mode on the board when in combat. HERO CHANGES Bloodseeker: Bloodrage: Now ramps up to his existing maximum attack speed bonus of 500 earlier, at 20% health (was 0%). Lich: Chain Frost: Bounce range changed to 2 (was 4).

1046930,Dota Underlords adding Duos mode and actual Underlords,"It&#8217;s gone a bit quiet down in <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dota-underlords/"">Dota Underlords</a>. Valve&#8217;s autobattler hasn&#8217;t received a chunky update for a few weeks, with team-battle tacticians left to twiddle their thumbs while the meta stagnates. Last night&#8217;s patch made Arc Warden a bit weaker and poked at a handful of other numbers, but I&#8217;m more interested in <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/underlords/announcements/detail/2878286363677464817"">Valve&#8217;s explanation</a> for why update&#8217;s have slowed down a tad.

1046930,A tiny update,"As you've probably noticed, today's update is pretty small. Let's chat about why this is and what's coming. Last time we talked about our plans, we detailed the features we are working on for our next big update. Internally, we are calling that update The Big Update (surprise), and it's one of the last milestones on our road to Season One. This update will include 2 playable Underlords, the Duos team mode, 6 new Heroes, 3 new Alliances, and an updated user interface. We're currently shooting to release this update in the first half of October. The final stop will come not long after, with the official launch of the complete game in 1.0. This will come with 2 more Underlords, the Battle Pass, the City Crawl, and will be the official beginning of Underlords Season One. To give you an idea of how far apart the internal and external builds are, here's our current Dashboard: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35233241/c6a984652fce41e650c37c0ccf92c5de058fa9f5.jpg These differences extend to other areas as well and are fully intertwined, making it difficult to ship them separately. This is why we've decided to spend all our efforts on finishing and shipping everything together. You can expect any updates in the next few weeks to be more in the ""bugs & balance"" category as we prepare for the release of The Big Update. We cannot wait to talk more about Season One with you, so expect to hear more about it soon.",1568331877,
1046930,The Update In Which Tusk And Friends Get Mighty Stylish,"GENERAL Uncap Proto-Pass XP, up level cap to 99. 2-star and 3-star visual upgrades for Alchemist, Bloodseeker, Crystal Maiden, Sand King, and Tusk. Animation imrpovements. FX optimization and improvements. Added framerate option on mobile. Now you can select from the default (30FPS), 60FPS, and 15FPS (battery saver), as well as an option to up to 60FPS only while plugged in. When a unit in the shop can combine into a 3-star unit, the 3-star version rather than the 2-star version is shown. GAMEPLAY Melee units can now target barricades if no better targets are available. Assassin targeting and Blink Dagger targeting is now a bit more random between left and right when selecting the farthest target. HERO CHANGES Arc Warden: Tempest Double: There is now a 3 second cooldown on creating another clone whenever a clone dies. Sand King: Caustic Finale: Fixed an issue where duration was not set properly, leading to Caustic Finale doing the timer-expired rather than the on-death damage much of the time. Tidehunter: Ravage: Now applies its damage after the stun is applied, so the Shaman Ace Effect interacts properly. Tiny: Toss: Tiny can now toss Target Buddy. ",1567732533,
