1086940,Community Update #36 A Very Moddy Christmas,"Hello friends, The days are getting colder, the holiday decorations are creeping out early, and honestly? We’re leaning into it. It’s been a long year, one that saw Baldur’s Gate 3 receive twelve new subclasses, full cross-play support, and the arrival of photo mode - the last final, final last patch. It’s been an exciting year for us, what with also launching Larian: Channel From Hell, with weekly streams where you’ve had sneak peeks into our madness, met valued members of the team, and pushed Aoife to her limits with her Dark Urge run. However, they’re not the only stars of the show - your mods have caused tears, laughter, and pain. Lots of pain. Like getting rammed in the ankles by a muscle car pain. So before we close out on 2025, we’re looking back at some of the best moments brought about by your mods!The Devs Of Christmas - A Four-Hour Honour Mode Stream But before we start our reminiscing, we’re kicking off the festive season with a livestream party - and you’re invited! Don your ugliest Christmas sweater, warm up some cocoa, and curl up in front of the computer for a four-hour-long stream where Senior Communications Developer, Aoife Wilson, has bribed devs across Larian Studios with cheese and a joyous time, as they attempt an honour mode run! Live on the 3rd of December at 2pm GMT, every death will mean a new challenger will try their might. Nothing says Christmas cheer like Myrkul obliterating your existence, as my gran always said.This will now be our last stream for the year, as the Community Team heads on over to The Game Awards, where we’ve been nominated for Best Community Support! Which, bugger us sideways, to be nominated for a third year in a row is a complete honour.Should you want to share the love, sign in and vote for Baldur’s Gate 3 to win the Best Community Support award by following this link: https://www.thegameawards.com/nominees/best-community-support Modding MomentsBunnies Gate 3 Mod Author 0iml bore witness to the Patch 7 animated trailer and insisted giant bunnies should be a permanent fixture of the Sword Coast. Find the 126 bunnies (plus 3 top-secret special bunnies) or do as we do: install it, forget you installed it, and be pleasantly surprised by the expertly placed balls of fluff. Pool FloatiesAesthetically pleasing and life-saving. If you were drowning in a puddle, perhaps.Pool Floaties by baeator offers you a choice of four inflatable pool floatie hats that can be used in the helmet slot, each with varying stats to help you navigate the watery waves. To really give your playthrough an edge, the Goostarion Floatie Hat comes equipped with its own Astarion starting armour. Dye Astarion’s armour, and your Goostarion will match! Egg Magic: Clownify Made by Bugby128, consume a clown egg and learn the ability to use new cantrips that paint you with clown makeup. Nothing else to be said, really, beyond the fact that Bugby has undoubtedly dealt psychic harm by forcing the image of a clown laying an egg into our minds.Withers Big NaturalsParticularly effective at generating hysteria when forgetting you have those puppies installed and arriving at the Dank Crypt. Thank you, MaybeeAdam, we wouldn’t have him any other way. Car WildshapeThanks to mod author wa_rouk, you can now recruit Carlach, Gale Decarios, Ascarion, Shadowkart, Vehicwyll, Lane’zel… Or the whole fleet, if you will. We have a soft spot for Carlach; she unfortunately has a penchant for vehicular manslaughter.  Handsome AstarionA refined classic. Mod author FR05T has given Astarion a makeover, and it never fails to catch us off guard. Did you know he will also be handsome in his character portrait? Neither did we. All-rounder Owlbear BeanieSee, we added this mod for the adorable beanies, not realising mod author chunyou had enchanted them with quite a few luck buffs. But who needs game balance when you can look this adorable? Want an owlbear beanie of your own? These are inspired by the very real Owlbear beanies you can find in the Larian merch store! Such a Tease - a Raphael redressing mod & Raphameow (Raphael with cat ears) Listen, we have no excuse for enabling these.

Enjoyed by all.DinoScratch Mod author chunyou has lovingly stitched together these adorable dinosaur pyjamas for Scratch, perfect for those cold camp nights.

1086940,Community Update #35 Baldur's Gate 3 Turns Two,"Happy birthday, gang! Baldur's Gate 3 turns two - hard to believe, isn't it?It feels like only yesterday we were streaming our launch-day Panel From Hell from a cathedral in Ghent and earning a TikTok ban in the process for our druidic love crimes.But time flies. Two years later, Baldur’s Gate 3 has grown into something far beyond what we could have ever imagined back then - it’s become a shared universe shaped just as much by your imaginations as ours. You've embraced the characters, rewritten the rules, and made the world your own - and it’s been a joy to watch.Swen’s shared words couldn’t ring more true, and while we’ll spare you our soppy sentimentality, because of Baldur’s Gate 3 and your love for the game, we can now bring you a whole new craziness that we hope you will love just as much.So let’s celebrate the story so far with the only thing more powerful than magic: cold, hard stats.2 Years of Baldur’s Gate 3Since the introduction of mod support in September 2024, you’ve uploaded over 8,500 mods to mod.io and hit 265 MILLION mod downloads (of which, over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals by the way - we just thought you’d like to know.). We love seeing what you create, and the recent Modathon held by The BG3 Modding Community last month was no exception. The month-long community-run modding event saw 85 mod authors create over 160 new mods that have been downloaded over 150,000 times!

A big congratulations to everyone involved, from the organisation to the achievements awarded!You’ve raised the bar with every mod, and we want to match that energy.

In the meantime, tag us in your creations @larianstudios and share your creations with us in the official Larian Studios Discord server!Baldur’s Gate 3 In NumbersAfter celebrating the big numbers last year, we’re sharing some of the smaller stats, because honestly, does size really matter? Check out the rare achievements and the even rarer choices that you’ve been making in-game.

Approach with caution, there may be spoilers ahead!Of the half a million masochists brave heroes who finished the game in Honour Mode, a few of you decided to go about it in creative ways: We released Patch 8 (The Final Patch) in April this year, bringing you both cross-play, a photo mode, and 12 new subclasses, which we can only assume sparked many an argument between friends about whether Shadowheart gives Life Cleric or Death Cleric vibes (turns out the results are balanced, like all things in life and death).Photo Mode CreationsWe’re happy to see you’ve used your new tools for good, evil, rabbits, and butts.

From its sprawling, living world to its cast of lovable yet complex characters, Larian's Dungeons and Dragons epic rightfully deserves its place in the spotlight. In its wake, we've seen a resurgence in narrative-driven RPGs, with Sandfall's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being the latest triumph. But with BG3 now being considered the gold standard for RPGs, others will, of course, try to emulate its success.

GAME Crashes and Performance Fixed a crash when hovering over certain items in the inventory or while trading. Fixed trippy, high-saturation graphical artefacts appearing in-game, often when teleporting using waypoints. New Subclasses Hexblade warlocks can now replace a spell at Level 2 like the other warlock subclasses. Immutable Form now reacts to Arcane Shot: Banishing Arrow. The Fancy Footwork passive now also works even if you miss. Vaprak's Greed now takes into account Human Versatility and increases carrying capacity accordingly by another quarter. Arcane Shot: Grasping Arrow can now also damage Flying targets when they move. Removed the Long Rest indicator on the Accursed Spectre passive tooltip. Dazzling Breath now correctly applies the spellcasting ability modifier when an enemy succeeds its Saving Throw. Dismissing Wind Walk and Gaseous Form will no longer also remove your Starry Form. The Shadow Blade no longer shows an empty tooltip when you examine the item while upcasting. Fixed a bug causing Shadow Blade to lose properties when other conditions are removed. This could cause, for example, the blade to lose any bonus damage when Concentration is broken. Piercing Arrow's overall damage is now also reduced by half rather than just the bonus damage. Curving Shot will now only target enemies and not neutral parties. (This could cause neutral parties to, then, naturally, also become your enemies.) Fixed a bug allowing Sneak Attacks to be triggered on Dirty Trick: Sand Toss. Gameplay and Scripting Removed some defunct dialogue that mistakenly made it into Minthara's Speak with Dead dialogue in Patch 8. Fixed an issue preventing you from waking up if you Long Rested while Shadowheart was killed outside of camp after deciding her parents' fate. The recast of Cloudkill at Level 6 is now accurately marked as Level 6 instead of Level 5 in the UI. Fixed a bug preventing you from moving corpses into containers on the controller or split screen UI. Fixed a multiplayer bug where the Traveller's Chest belonging to the client wouldn't show up in the Basement (Blighted Village) camp in Act I. Fixed the Illusory Double invoked with Invoke Duplicity appearing to lack equipment and armour. Fixed a bug where if you had Scratch summoned and then travelled to a new region, he would be dismissed once the new region loaded and, as a bonus, appear dead in your party line. All barbarian Rages now correctly gain 3 damage bonus, instead of the previous 2, for objects thrown in a Rage once they hit Level 9. The movement-based Booming Blade condition will no longer apply to inanimate objects that can't move on their own anyway. Photo Mode Fixed Wild-Shaped boars and cats not paying proper attention to the 'Look at Camera' option. Fixed a 'FileSystem error' potentially triggering for users who use non-Latin Windows user accounts when trying to save a screenshot using Photo Mode. UI and Tooltips Fixed inconsistent damage values on the Booming Blade tooltips at higher levels. Fixed a bug causing certain skill tooltips to not appear when you hover over them unless you pin them.

Fixed an issue with the way the Gloves of Battlemage's Power interact with dual-wielded weapons. Fixed a bug causing paladins to lose their Auras after a Long Rest. The War Priest attack will no longer disable if the character moves before attacking. Tavern Brawler no longer adds a damage bonus to Elemental Cleaver's elemental damage in Honour Mode. Fixed a bug where, if you told the goblins at Moonrise Towers to sacrifice themselves, the subsequent cinematic wouldn't play correctly and the goblins would become uninteractable. Fixed a bug preventing camera movement with WASD while Shift is pressed. Polearm Clout now properly gains bonuses to its weapon damage from various sources. Weapons bound using Pact of the Blade or Hexblade now properly use the Charisma modifier for the Polearm Clout attack. Magical Ambush, Skilled Skullduggery, and Lethal Concealment no longer keep disappearing while sneaking. Recasting Cloudkill after upcasting it to Level 6 will now cast the correct upcasted version. Also fixed the upcasted Cloudkill visuals. Updated Shadow Blade to only give Advantage to melee weapon attacks made while the Shadow Blade is equipped. Cross-Play Fixed a bug where the client would get stuck in a loading screen when attempting to join a cross-play lobby uninvited. Fixed a bug letting you enable cross-play and invite players while in a non-cross-play session if you accessed the settings via the escape menu. Fixed a bug letting users try to join the lobby in the friends panel before the lobby list was updated. Fixed an issue causing cross-play hosts to get stuck at 0% loading if a client joins the game while the host is in the cinematic after Character Creation. Added a timeout that will bring you back to the main menu if your attempt to join a cross-play game fails. If your connection is interrupted on PC and you get the 'Online features are disabled' message, your online session settings will now be disabled as indicated. This mimics the existing flow on consoles. Improved the handling of network disconnections for cross-play. Made username character limits consistent across platforms. Photo Mode Fixed the 'Highlights' setting not working properly on consoles. Fixed the 'Mirror' option on Photo Mode appearing in English across the localised versions of the game. Fixed a bug preventing you from selecting Tavflayer or Karlachflayer in the Photo Mode settings. New Subclasses Kills made while drunk as a Way of the Drunken Master monk now count towards the Punch Drunk achievement. It's only fair. Updated the description for the Shadow Infusion condition tooltips, which still had developer text in them. The chance to inflict Hexblade's Curse on a hit no longer increases every time the Warlock uses Bind Hexed Weapon. Circle of the Stars druids can now gain the additional Wild Shapes (Deep Rothé, Panther, Owlbear, Dilophosaurus). UI Fixed the Bonus Action icon missing on controller tooltips for some players with modded games.
