With Valve notoriously hush about upcoming projects, virtually everything we've heard about 'HLX', as it's referenced, has come from datamines. But it's not the only mystery project that's been spotted this year, as a new branch for something titled 'TF' has emerged too, seemingly in reference to Team Fortress.

Dota 2 and Counter-Strike are of course the poster children, but <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong> is still going extremely strong all these years later and benefitting from occasional updates, too. However, over time, classics like TF2 evolve - new mechanics, maps, and modes, balance changes, and even engine upgrades often mean that a game's original feel gets lost. Team Fortress 2 Classic is a long-running mod that aims to take things back to those early days of TF2, and it recently made its way to Steam. However, its upcoming open beta has been scrapped after coming across an unusual issue - Valve won't let something be a mod and a demo at the same time. This strange case may have also spawned a new problem for Team Fortress 2 Classic - it might have to rebrand. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/classic-mod-steam-beta-canceled-valve"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/summer-update-2025"">Valve's new Team Fortress 2 update adds ten maps and a lethal taunt</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/system-requirements"">Team Fortress 2 system requirements</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/mann-vs-machine-update"">Valve is updating Team Fortress 2's Mann vs Machine mode, and it wants your help</a> ",1760103190,
