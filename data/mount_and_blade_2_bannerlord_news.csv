(Defender AI is unchanged.)Adjusted ship capture visuals so the previous ship's icon switches to grey instead of red after capture of the new ship.Reduced incoming missile damage to the player by 60% while controlling the ship.Adjusted air friction and projectile speed for ship ballistas, which should make long-range shots more effective.Adjusted post-battle behavior so all troops (including the player) are unable to attack once the battle ends.Fixed several ship control and interaction issues:Increased the interaction area size for the Roundship control point.Fixed a spawn point and control point intersection issue on the Cog.Fixed the hand position for the control point on the Ghurab.Fixed the hand position for the control point on the Lodya.Fixed rope issues on the Dromakion.Fixed a visibility tag issue on the Roundship ballista.Fixed a bug that caused naval reinforcements to spawn in inaccessible positions due to ship movement, which could trap agents and prevent battles from ending.Fixed a bug that caused agents to get stuck inside Ghurab’s interior due to a physics object, sometimes preventing battles from ending.Fixed a bug that caused troops to get stuck on the sail mast holder of the Eastern Galley.Fixed a bug that caused troops to wait for allies before climbing, preventing AI units from using climbing equipment quickly.Fixed a bug that caused floating ship debris to get troops stuck instead of being pushed aside.Fixed a bug that caused the player’s camera to get stuck when a ship ballista got destroyed while the player was using it.Fixed a bug that caused the game to freeze while a troop was climbing onto a sinking ship.Fixed a bug that caused troops to receive incorrect figurehead and other initial bonuses when ships and crews were rearranged in Order of Battle.Fixed a bug that caused corpses to get stuck mid-air in certain edge cases during naval battles.Fixed a bug that caused wave physics to reset during naval battles, resulting in ships briefly jumping unnaturally.Fixed a bug that caused the player to be able to attempt capturing a ship even without fulfilling the requirements. This action is now disabled in these situations.Fixed a bug that caused broken oars to still apply force and create visual particles such as water wakes.Ships & UpgradesAdjusted ship upgrades so that the pieces purchased for a specific ship can no longer be equipped on other ships.Battles and SiegesHuscarl’s spear changed to be braceable instead of couchable.Character Development SystemIncreased the Shipmaster skill experience rate multiplier from ×0.6 to ×1.4.War Sails Storyline“Free the Sea Hounds’ Captives” quest adjustments:Enemy reinforcement ships in the end battle now start with an “Engage” order, preventing them from kiting and improving the flow of the final naval battle.Removed the dromon ship’s ram (ramming is still possible but less effective).Purig and his bodyguards now spawn with his crew but will not engage until the boss fight.Increased wind speed during the large naval battle.Added an objective marker and progress bar to the “Defeat Purig’s crew” objective.Adjusted enemy ship spawn points in the final fight; they now spawn in two closer, better-grouped formations.Allied ships are now allowed to attack Purig’s ship.Updated upgrade pieces for mission ships.Purig’s roundship now includes roof upgrades and additional visual elements.Purig now wields a two-handed axe - which also means that he no longer uses a shield.Added world map travel commentary from Gunnar for events, quests, and locations encountered during the naval storyline.Adjusted naval storyline set-piece encounters so enemy party siz...",1765554843,['patchnotes']

If it happened after you made her a governor, she should be immediately spawned and returned to that position.Should another family member be missing (like the younger brother), the same rules apply.Please note that ""fugitive state"" has a 30% chance to spawn the character daily.

Join us in watching the War Sails Launch Trailer!War Sails Features With War Sails, we’re bringing full naval warfare to Bannerlord for the first time. You’ll be able to command your own ships, lead fleets across the seas, and take part in large-scale naval battles as part of your campaign. War Sails is a single-player expansion that plugs directly into the base game: new region & faction, new naval battles, and a lot of ways to get into trouble on the water. The Nords & the Northern Kingdom War Sails adds a new Viking-inspired faction: the Nords, based in the northern region. You’ll travel through jagged coasts, taiga forests, and frozen fjords, visiting scattered settlements that feel almost like ships rising from the sea. There, you can trade, recruit warriors, work with Nord clans, or try to challenge their power yourself. The Nords Naval Battles We’ve built a naval system inspired by historical medieval sea battles. You’ll command ships that are affected by wind and waves, decide when to ram, when to board, and when to keep your distance. You can seize opportunities by boarding already engaged ships, prepare for an incoming attack by creating a floating fortress, or take a risk to tie down several enemies at once - giving your allies an edge elsewhere. You may also ram an enemy ship to sink it - or at least throw men off board, shatter oars, and compromise buoyancy. Well-placed arrows and ballista fire can also ignite and destroy enemy sails and ships, forcing crews to abandon their stations. Burning Sails And Ships A Larger World to Sail Calradia now extends to the north, including a settled island, coastal routes, and open sea. Weather plays a bigger role at sea: storms and currents can speed you up or grind you down. Riding the wind can make journeys faster, but attrition will punish long, poorly prepared expeditions. Naval trade, piracy, and the Nord presence all feed back into the campaign. New trade goods, ship production, and coastal routes give certain towns a chance to grow rich - if they can survive raids and naval invasions. Sieges can also involve the sea now: to fully cut off a coastal settlement, you’ll need a fleet to blockade it and stop supplies and reinforcements from slipping through. New Northern Region And Island Building and Growing Your Fleet War Sails adds 20 ships: 15 warships, 4 trade ships, and a civilian fishing vessel, all based on historical designs with their own handling and roles. You can:Equip ships with siege engines, cargo holds, upgraded sails, rams, and moreCapture enemy ships and figureheads in battleAcquire vessels from shipyards that build and stock ships based on their town’s culture and development Ramming Custom Naval Battles If you just want to jump straight into fighting, you can set up custom naval battles. Pick your hero, factions, fleet compositions, ships (with randomized upgrades), crew setups, and then choose the wind, season, and time of day on River, Coastal, or Open Sea maps – no campaign required. New Skills, Items & Troops We’ve expanded the character system with Nord-themed hairstyles, beards, and tattoos, as well as three new nautical skills focused on navigation, tactics, and stewardship at sea. There are also new weapons and gear – spears, swords, axes, shields, and armor – along with mariner troop branches that perform better in naval combat. You’ll also meet new companions with seafaring backgrounds. Naval Battle Getting Started: War Sails Questline If you’d like a guided introduction, there’s a new questline that takes you from your first steps on deck to commanding a small fleet. Through cinematics, scripted missions, and familiar Mount & Blade gameplay, you’ll learn the basics of ship control, then take the fight to a pirate confederacy alongside your newfound allies. Audio & Music We’ve added new Mediterranean and Nordic-inspired tracks and updated the soundscape for life at sea: winds, waves, creaking hulls, and the chaos of boarding actions and ship-to-ship combat. Patch v1.3.4 Is Now Available!Alongside War Sails, we’re also bringing the base game Patch v1.3.4 to all players and platforms. Some of you have already played the patch during our Beta phase and provided immensely valuable feedback. This allowed us to further balance and refine the experience for which we’re truly grateful.

261550,War Sails Q&A #4,"Greetings Warriors of Calradia! Less than 2 weeks to go before War Sails launches across PC and Consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S) - on the 26th of November, 2025! Following the Gameplay Showcase, we’ve rounded up your most asked questions and tackled them below. If your question isn’t covered here, reply below and we’ll tackle follow-ups in the comments. Wishlist now to stay updated and be ready to set sail on launch day! GeneralWhen will War Sails release on the 26th of November?We’re aiming to release the expansion on all platforms at 9:00 CET / 3:00 AM EST / 12:00 AM PST.What hardware specs will be required to run War Sails?You will be able to find the system requirements on the Steam Store page. Note that they will likely still change leading up to the release, as we determine the profiles based on the latest tests.Will the War Sails expansion be on Xbox Game Pass?It won't be on Game Pass at or around release. It's not yet determined if it will come to Game Pass in the future.Will it be possible to pre-order or pre-load the expansion?No.How much disk storage will War Sails require?Our current PC development build sits at ~33GB. While this may change slightly as we prepare for launch, we expect it to remain close to that size. Console builds run a little smaller, and download sizes may vary depending on platform compression and packaging.Will we be able to play War Sails on Steam Deck?War Sails won’t be Steam Deck verified at launch, but you’ll still be able to play on it on Day 1 - just like any other Steam game. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord has a “Playable” status on Steam Deck.Will the expansion have a launch discount?Yes - War Sails will be 10% off on all platforms for the first 2 weeks to celebrate the launch.“War Sails will be arriving on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, and GoG)"" - What about the Xbox app on PC?It will be arriving on the Xbox PC app on Windows as well.Will there be a launch stream?Yes. We’ll be partnering with many of the content creators you already know to kick things off on release day. More details on this will follow.GameplayHow much will it cost to acquire ships?Ship prices will range from 12.000 denars for light ships to 150.000 denars for heavy hulls, depending on any existing upgrades applied to the ship at the time of purchase. Certain perks can also reduce the final purchase price. These are subject to change based on ongoing balancing efforts.Will there be a way to travel between ports without having your own ship?No.Will soldiers be able to escape while at sea due to no food or morale, or will soldiers die instead? Troops won’t desert due to low morale at sea (until you reach and spend time on land again), but will get wounded if there’s not enough food.Could you explain further if the player character can swim indefinitely, and if NPCs can climb back on board if they're quick enough?Yes, your character can swim without a time limit. Other troops, however, have limited endurance in the water based on their tier, whether they have a mariner background, and how heavily they're armoured. If their ship sinks or they end up overboard, they'll try to swim to the nearest friendly vessel and climb aboard - assuming they reach it in time.What happens if I board and take over an enemy ship, but my original ship sinks? Do I lose the battle?You won’t lose the battle - it’ll still count as a victory. However, since your original ship is gone, you’ll find yourself without a vessel once the mission ends. Unless you then capture an enemy ship in the loot screen, your party will be left rafting toward the nearest shore.If one of my ships is destroyed, and I have more than eight in my fleet, will another one join the battle? Or do reinforcements only come from the troops on the starting ships?There are no ship reinforcements during the battle — only the eight deployed ships participate. However, some vessels can reinforce their own decks with additional troops if their maximum crew size exceeds their deck capacity.Will using the ballista improve the Engineering skill, like in sieges?Yes - operating the ballista in naval battles will increase your Engineering skill, just like in sieges. It will also contribute to levelling the new Mariner skill.If you name a ship in the port, will that name be displayed in OoB?Yes.Will there be War Sails-specific cheats on PC?Yes, you’ll be able to conjure some epic-looking ships by giving yourself any hull you want and unlocking any figurehead you like.Will naval custom battles be part of War Sails?Yes! Following your feedback from a previous community Q&A, we’ve decided to add naval custom battles — and they’ll be available from day one! The custom battle setup will let you choose factions, select ships, randomize upgrades, pick troop types and numbers, and more.",1763029164,

Wind, oars and the naval readiness of your crew are essential, and the ship you bring to a fight only becomes dangerous if you handle it well. This blog focuses on the naval combat experience: how you steer, how boarding works, how rams land, and how a battle moves from opening volleys to the clash on the ropes and planks.Hoisting the SailsBefore the fight begins, the Order of Battle phase allows you to organize your forces — just as you would on land. In naval engagements, however, each formation represents a single ship and its crew. Here, you’ll select your flagship, the vessel you’ll personally helm, while assigning the remaining ships to companions or allied nobles.The number of ships armies can deploy in an engagement is determined by their members' perks, with each side being able to launch up to eight ships. If your fleet includes more than that, you can review the roster and decide which ships to bring into the fray. For those who prefer a quicker start, you can also choose Auto-Deploy and immediately set sail against the enemy.Order of BattleOnce the battle begins, you take direct control of your ship from the helm. Smaller vessels are steered by hand at the rudder, while larger ones demand authority from the quarterdeck, where you guide your crew through the stormy waves.Ship Control Points: Smaller ships, Bigger shipsThe opening moments of a sea battle are all about feeling the wind and setting your approach. Your sails impact both your speed and maneuverability — unfurl them to harness the wind’s strength and build momentum, or furl them when you need sharper handling with oars.Your wind dial shows the wind’s direction relative to your ship: green marks a favorable angle, while red warns that your sails will fight against the wind instead of working with it. Each rig type behaves differently. Square sails catch a smaller wind coverage but deliver powerful bursts of speed when aligned. Lateen sails offer broader coverage, letting you carry pace across wider directions, while hybrid rigs balance the strengths of both. Hybrid sail rigs have one unique advantage — you can choose to furl the square sail while keeping the lateen one unfurled, giving you a wider coverage but stripping you of some power in the process.Wind dial, left to right: Square, Lateen, HybridWhen the wind falters, oarsmen become your lifeline. Rowing serves as a secondary means of thrust in naval battles, letting ships move even when the sails hang still. Oars can be used directly by the player as well, and the troops will retract them when ships draw alongside to prevent shearing against nearby hulls. While regular hull contact won’t harm them, a direct ram strike can — oars caught near the impact may snap under the force.If you align a strong sail rig with a favorable wind angle and build speed, oars add little once you’re already moving fast — and knowing that may be crucial. Every man on a rowing bench is one less bow on deck.You can issue three levels of rowing commands:Stop using oars – benches are empty, and every crewman is ready to fight.Use oars at half power – half the benches are manned, giving steady thrust while keeping some hands free for combat.Use oars at full power – every bench is filled, maximizing speed but leaving fewer fighters on deck.With oars, you can maneuver without wind, pivot on the spot, or even row in reverse. Oar Power CommandsThe Battle BeginsEach ship functions as its own formation, following your orders. While you helm one vessel directly, you can still orchestrate the wider fight — not by directing allied soldiers but selecting their ships to issue formation orders: move, follow, skirmish, engage, or target a specific enemy. Should you choose to delegate command, AI captains can skirmish if they hold missile superiority, support pressured allies, avoid collisions, or close in to ram and board when the moment is right.Moving on from those first moments, most battles open at range. If your ship carries a ballista, you can take control of it from the helm. Line up your shot and depending on the ballista type — unleash bolts, stones or fire pots before proceeding with your next maneuver. And should you find yourself away from the helm, you can operate the weapon directly — much like in siege battles.Archers and javelin throwers trade volleys across the waves, drawing from nearby supply crates to keep the pressure going longer. With braziers, those volleys turn into raining flames — fire arrows that can burn sails and set hulls ablaze. A ship with its sails burned is left without ...",1761837415,"['workshop', 'mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1301790999_1761842098_0', 'ModAct_1434278705_1761894438_4', 'mod_require_rereview']"
261550,Dev Blog: Ships,"Greetings Warriors of Calradia!As Calradia’s coastlines open to trade, raiding, and full-scale naval warfare, it’s time to step aboard and take a closer look at the ships you’ll command in War Sails. This developer blog will dive into the variety of vessels, their design inspiration, their performance on the high seas — and how you can customize them to suit your own strategy.Ship Classes & SailsShips in War Sails fall into three core classes — Light, Medium, and Heavy — each tuned for a different role in naval engagements.Light ships are affordable and tend to excel in acceleration as well as maneuverability — making them the choice for flank attack. However, their lower crew capacity and hit points make them easy targets when caught off guard. Their smaller size also makes them less stable in rough weather and results in fewer potential upgrades.Medium ships strike a balance between price, durability, deck capacity, and upgrade potential. They are versatile and able to adapt to a range of roles without specializing in any one area. Heavy ships are built for staying power. Wide decks, large crew capacity, thick hulls, and a wealth of upgrades to pick from allow them to dominate in prolonged engagements — though all of this comes at a hefty price in denars. Their larger size tends to make them less responsive when changing direction, but enables them to power through rough seas in the heat of battle. Alongside these, some ships carry the Trade designation, a secondary characteristic that applies to vessels built for commerce and logistics rather than combat. Trade ships differ from warships in several key ways: they carry fewer troops, offer more inventory space, and require smaller skeletal crews to operate, making them the preferred choice for merchant convoys. Trade CogA ship’s performance at sea is also shaped by its sail geometry, which governs how it handles under varying wind conditions. Square sails offer quick acceleration and perform well in calm winds, but struggle against the wind. Lateen sails catch wind from more directions, enabling higher peak speeds and better versatility, though they result in slower acceleration and lower responsiveness. Hybrid rigs blend both types for steadier control in changing winds. A ship’s sail type is fixed to its design and can’t be swapped, but sail upgrades improve performance within those limits. Rig type, left to right: Square, Lateen, HybridShipsShips in War Sails are inspired by real-world vessels that match the cultures of Calradia. From square-sailed cogs and roundships in the west to lateen-rigged galleys and sailboats in the east, each ship draws inspiration from historical designs. Every faction fields at least one unique ship reflecting its identity, while drawing the rest of its fleet from shared regional pools — bringing the total to 20 unique ships. However, not all factions have access to every ship class. For instance, the Empire employs vessels across all sizes, while the Nords use light and medium ships geared for boarding. Access to these ships depends not just on location, but also on infrastructure. Ports must be upgraded via settlement projects. A low-level shipyard might offer only a few light ships, while higher levels unlock medium and heavy ships, with more vessels for sale. The Empire’s navy is the most well-rounded in Calradia. Their fleet includes the Liburna, a medium vessel with a compact hull and sharp contours, built to withstand hits and even deliver ramming strikes. The Dromon, their heavy flagship, is a broad, high-decked vessel with hybrid sails and tall sides, evoking the form of historical dromons. It’s designed to serve as a command ship, with ample space for crew and inventory, offering endurance and control in large-scale engagements. Liburna and DromonAserai ships combine sleek sailboat hulls with galley-like decks. Their heavy vessel, the Ghurab, features a lean frame with high decks and a sharply rising bow, relying primarily on sail power for speed while offering modest oar support for repositioning. Though slower to accelerate, its latten sails allow for higher speed with excellent wind coverage. GhurabBattania draws from riverine and woodland traditions, producing vessels reflecting this. Inspired by the real-world birlinn, a ship used in medieval Scotland. The Battanian Birlinn is a light, square-sailed ship with a narrow hull and modest height, designed for speed and agility in calmer waters. Its open deck layout supports ranged combat well, though limited crew capacity makes it more vulnerable to boarding and less effective in longer engagements. BirlinnThe Khuzait bring their nomadic speed and skirmishing tradition to the sea with ships like the Qalguk. This heavy flagship has a wide, long hull equipped with lateen sails. Its high speed, paired with solid deck space and archer positions, makes it ideal for long-range pressure. However, like most lateen-rigged ships, it suffers from lower acceleration and lacks...",1759405652,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1434278705_1759406504_0', 'ModAct_1434411615_1759410394_4', 'ModAct_1434411615_1759473628_4', 'ModAct_1434411615_1759480591_4', 'mod_require_rereview']"

In this War Sails developer blog, we’re turning our prow toward the untamed North to introduce the Nords. We will trace their backstory, culture, and highlight what defines the kingdom — covering architecture, equipment, troops, and more. Stick until the end to get a glimpse at the pirates that will prey on Calradia’s waters. As always, please note that some details may still change as we get closer to the release. Join us in watching the new trailer showcasing the Nords! The Nords In Calradia’s far-northern reaches, long before a single crown united the Nordvyg, each settled fjord kept to its own — relying on the sea for survival. The local chieftains had their longships sail south bearing walrus ivory, whale oil, and fish to sell – then return to the fjords laden with plunder and captives. Until recently, southerners could take comfort that the half-dozen so-called ""kings"" of the Nordvyg each controlled little more than a shrine or slave market surrounded by a wooden palisade. A generation ago, however, Volbjorn the Hungry returned from a decade in the empire's Vaegar Guard with great riches. He used this wealth to bend the northland to his will, forcing its chieftains through blood and bribery to pledge themselves as his jarls. Today, his son rules, and though the bonds holding this new realm together are weak, they may be strengthened by turning their vassals' attentions to conquest. Volbjorn’s son, Halthdar the Golden of clan Throsniring, now rules from Thronderlag. He is a seasoned warrior who would otherwise be beloved by all who followed him into battle and feasted alongside him, but he is a king in a land still unhappy to be a kingdom. Many blame him for his father’s sins and would gladly return to the old days when they answered to no one. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/Nord_King.avif Halthdar “the Golden” Throsniring In-Engine Cinematic Nord Homelands On the map, Nord lands run from the Jumne River in the east across Nordvyg to the isle of Beinland in the west, with four towns — Hargard, Thronderlag, Gretysfjord, and Hvalvik. Hargard, for example, stands on a rocky bank of the Jumne River, founded by Nordic tribes from the western fjords several generations ago. Today, it serves as the meeting place of Nords, Vanni, and Sturgians, all harvesting the wealth of the river valley to sell to the peoples of the south. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/Hargard.avif Hargard Town Here and throughout the North, life follows the old ways — longhouses serve as home and council hall, shipwrights turn pine and oak into longships, and each clan keeps its own sagas. Across the land, the Nordvyg is built of timber and turf, with mossy thatch, curved roofs, and dragon-headed beams. The walls of Nord towns and castles follow the lay of the hills, their lines bending with the land. Timber or stone towers rise above sturdy palisades, the logs set atop foundations of solid stone. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/68ed5ccf4c678cdd3d74281d5091731d2b98cb17.pngNord Gatehouse Levels Concept Art Past the palisades, the tavern greets friend and stranger alike — nets on the beams, a hearth at its heart, and long tables carved with the marks of many feasts. Higher still rises the keep, where the jarl’s high seat faces the hall, and chambers lie just beyond a screen of wood and wicker. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/TavernKeep.avif Nord Tavern and Keep Yet beyond these halls lies the true breadth of the Nord realm — the northern frontier, where the land itself shapes every path and battlefield. Along the coasts, rugged peaks rise steeply above the waves; inland, dense green forests close around the road; and farther still stretch wide, stony fields with only scattered trees. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/Battle_terrains.avif Northern Battle Terrains Nord Equipment & Troops Nord warriors arm themselves for the sea and the hard ground alike. Their round shields may be plain, painted, or decorated. They wield hand or long axes, and spears in the shield wall, with javelins and throwing axes to hurl before the clash. Straight-edged swords hang at their sides, while the finest among them carry the Atgeir — a long-hafted blade for the strongest arms. Their armor ranges from padded coats and tough leather to mail shirts, with cloaks thrown over the shoulders against harsh weather. Helmets are made to give clear sight and easy breath, for a man must keep his wits when the deck creaks beneath him. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/3c77d7eac29a609cc9aa3df3c92ee6f0d74e1ef3.pngNord Shields Concept Art A Nord warband begins with the Younglings — men barely old enough to grip a shield, armed with little more than a hatchet and courage.

261550,War Sails Q&A #3,"Greetings Warriors of Calradia! Our “Setting Sail” dev blog revealed the expanded Calradia coming with War Sails as well as the new campaign gameplay mechanics — and your questions quickly followed. Below you’ll find answers to some of the most common ones since our last Q&A.Got something else you’re curious about? Drop your questions below — we’ll be picking some for the next Q&A!GeneralIs the new expanded/changed map from War Sails also in the base game, or do you have two different world maps?There will be two separate world maps - the existing one for the base game and the new one for War Sails. The latter will contain changes relevant to naval gameplay and the new Nord faction discussed in our last blog.Will bridges interrupt sailing on rivers?No, bridges won’t disrupt your naval voyage.How many towns and castles will the new Nord kingdom control?Four towns and ten castles, though the exact number of castles may still change slightly as we balance the experience.What food will the Nordic villages produce?The harsh environment of the North makes it harder to produce surplus grain, leaving the Nords to rely more on fish. Several villages across the map also had their production changed to accommodate the new Warlus Ivory and Whale Oil trade goods, as well as to boost fish yields, bringing them on par with grain as another staple food source of Calradia. All of these will introduce new trade opportunities in combination with naval voyages.What will happen to the islands between the Aserai and the Empire?They will no longer be there in the War Sails map.How will ships enter the Perassic Sea — due to the passage between Aserai and the Western Empire?To open the seas, some land also had to give way. Two major crossings — once narrow land bridges — have been removed. The southern corridor between Quyaz and Ortysia, and the northern pass linking Omor to Varnovapol. This allows for travel into two massive bodies of water, which would otherwise be blocked off.When forming a naval army, does each party have to own and maintain its own ships, or can an army leader supply vessels for everyone?Each party is responsible for acquiring and maintaining its own ships. However, armies may set sail even if not all linked-up parties have ships, as long as some parties in the army have them. Additionally, a low ship vs troop ratio penalizes the army’s campaign movement speed.Shipless parties “on route” to join the army try to link up on land or move to the last known army embarking position if the army is already naval. Once the army disembarks, they attempt to link up via land again. Parties in this limbo state also take care of their urgent needs, like acquiring food or avoiding significant threats.The army creation menu contains information about which summonable parties have ships — allowing you to make informed decisions that impact your army’s effectiveness on waterways.In the previous posts, you mentioned how horses take up inventory space on ships and do not provide a naval speed bonus. Does this apply to cavalry units, and will the AI have the same restrictions as the player?Yes, it includes both cavalry and horse archers. This system benefits factions like the Nords, who rely more on mariner troops, while limiting cavalry-heavy factions like the Khuzaits. The AI follows the same restrictions as the player.Will we have a skill or a companion that can predict the storms?The Boatswain skill will reduce the negative effects, though the storms themselves aren’t predictable. These dynamic weather events will move across the sea and deal damage to ships caught in them. Players will be able to spot storms forming thanks to visual cues like dark clouds and thunder during a brief buildup phase. While you can’t forecast their paths, careful navigation and good ship stats can help you pass through safely or avoid them entirely.Can you order your ships to meet you at a port while you're elsewhere, or do you need to be at the port before you summon them?You need to be at the port yourself — ships can only be summoned to the port you're currently in.Will ships always have a fixed waiting time to arrive when summoned, or does it depend on how far they are from the destination port?Arrival time depends on distance, but it's shorter than regular travel time. Certain perks can reduce it even further.If a town is captured while our ships are docked there, will we lose them? And does the same apply if enemy ships are docked when we take the town?No, ships will automatically leave the port when the town changes hands, regardless of who owns them. However, they will not be interactable — you will need to visit another port to summon them.Do blockade-breaking naval battles take place in the port or open water? And near river towns, are river scenes used?They take place in coastal waters for seaside towns, and river battles are triggered for riverside towns.How will the AI nobles decide whether to follow a land or naval path?For each journ...",1752159769,

261550,Dev Blog: Setting Sail,"Greetings Warriors of Calradia!Welcome to the War Sails developer blog series. We’re excited to share our progress on the features taking shape, though as with all things in development, please note that details may shift as we navigate our course towards the release of the expansion in Early Fall 2025.With War Sails, Calradia’s horizons have grown — quite literally. Today, we want to take you behind the scenes of the world map expansion and share how we’ve reshaped the land and sea to support the introduction of the newly added Nords faction and naval gameplay. We’ll also be diving into the systems that shape life at sea — from the flow of ship movement to the tactics of naval blockades, and the stormy hazards that test every voyage across Calradia’s waters.New Shores, New StrugglesThe world map in War Sails now stretches beyond its former borders with an expansion to the north. We can divide these additions into three parts, starting with a new rugged long strip of a south-facing coastline — the Nordvyg proper. Passing through this terrain often means crossing rocky mountains and pushing through valleys filled with dense forests, not to mention the icy, cold winters. Nordvyg properTo the west of Nordvyg and across the sea, we find a recently colonized Island of Beinland — the land of bones. This refers to either the walrus ivory that drew the original settlers there or the remains they left along its desolate shores. Island of BeinlandTo the east of Nordvyg, you may find yourself wandering through the Jumne river area, where mysterious burial pits left by some long-forgotten people lie scattered along the riverbanks. The river runs south, eventually reaching Khuzait lands, allowing Nords to raid and trade along the shores of lakes Laconis and Tanaesis. Jumne river areaStrategic Considerations & BlockadesAdapting Calradia for naval travel meant more than opening the seas — it required reshaping the very veins of the continent. Certain rivers have been widened to support inland navigation, allowing ships to reach far beyond the open sea, while bridges have been reconsidered to maintain vital overland routes. Widened rivers Several towns have also been relocated closer to water, weaving them into the expanding maritime trade network. For settlements now hugging rivers and coasts, danger sails closer — rival ports are now just a voyage away. To meet this new maritime threat, both parties and armies can now travel by water, gaining access to naval movement and combat. Armies, in particular, are restructured into fleets once they set sail — retaining much of their land-based functions, though with some changes and limitations.Parties with ships and fleets play a major role in supporting sieges of coastal settlements — not by storming towns from the sea, but by enforcing naval blockades that cut off reinforcements, trade, and escape. When a force besieges a coastal settlement and has ships available, a blockade is automatically formed once the siege camp is established.Naval blockadeMaintaining a blockade introduces new risks and decisions. Enemy naval parties may attempt to aid the defenders — the besieging player must then choose to engage in a naval battle or withdraw. Victory keeps the blockade intact; defeat lifts both the blockade and the siege; withdrawing preserves the land siege, but allows enemies to reinforce the town by water. The player can also attempt to reinforce a besieged town from the water — either by breaking through the blockade at the cost of some troops, or by attacking the fleet directly to lift it. Likewise, if trapped inside, they may try a costly breakout or sally out straight for the enemy ships.Hoisting the SailsYour naval journey begins at any town with access to the sea or a river. From these ports, you can purchase or sell ships, repair and upgrade them — all for the right price in denars. Ships can also be given to your clan — either through the port, which requires a few days and a small escort of troops for delivery, or instantly by speaking to the clan members directly, where you can also take command of any ships they currently control.Ship managementOnce your ships are ready, you're free to set sail in any direction across Calradia’s expanding waters. You can then return to any town with naval access or disembark at suitable landing areas — though some coastlines, such as sharp cliffs and rugged shores, are not accessible for landing. Disembarking and boarding take time based on your party size and inventory weight, so consider this when pursuing enemies or trying to escape quickly.After landing, however, you may find yourself busy raiding and sieging enemy settlements, eventually wandering far off from your ships. To set sail again, you can either head back to your anchored ships or make for the nearest coastal town and summon your ships to meet you there.Naval Speed, Wind & CurrentsHow swiftly you cut through the seas on the campaign map in War Sails depends on a range of...",1751551537,"['workshop', 'mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1691520782_1751552496_0', 'ModAct_487486347_1757666200_4', 'ModAct_1425146861_1757926260_4', 'ModAct_1434723431_1759913819_4', 'mod_require_rereview']"

261550,War Sails Q&A #2,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/5d8cb6306a65c72488b2c64b4713648a1171e6f7.png Greetings Warriors of Calradia! Thank you all for your understanding and support following last week’s announcement about the delay of War Sails. Today, we want to answer some of the questions you had since our last Q&A with many more details to come in the following weeks. Got something else you’re curious about? Drop your questions below —we’ll be picking some for the next Q&A! General Will there be swimming and drowning? Yes. Characters can swim, dive, climb back on board, and they’ll drown under certain conditions. Will we be able to put horses on ships (keep them in inventory while sailing the world map)? Yes, you will be able to keep mounts in inventory on ships, but unlike on land, they will take up ship inventory space instead of providing it. They also won’t provide a speed bonus. Will you be able to travel through river systems? Yes, you will be able to sail on rivers in War Sails, allowing you to reach certain towns and strategic points. Combat on rivers will also be supported, with scenes designed to reflect the narrow, terrain-restricted nature of river warfare. Will you be able to run Merchant vessels like caravans? Yes! You’ll be able to buy trade convoys from coastal town merchants. You will also have the option of going for the standard or armed convoys, with the latter having more troops to protect against pirates. These convoys will travel from one coastal town to another, trading goods and generating profit, but they will be vulnerable to various threats along the way, so protection matters. Will there be a new Nord voice for character creation to go with the new hairstyles and tattoos? Characters from the new Nord faction will have distinct Scandinavian-inspired accents in campaign conversations (similar to the current unique voice-over content per culture). New voice presets will also be added to character creation, and they will be available to all cultures. With Nords being added, will Sturgian troops be modified further to be closer to Vaegirs, avoiding overlap in style? We’re making some visual and characteristic tweaks to Sturgia so that they will stand apart from the Nords, but we don’t want to make the changes so drastic that they feel alien to players who’ve gotten used to their current design. For example, one of the Sturgian cultural bonuses, as well as some Nordic-inspired Sturgian banner icons will be changed. Likewise, various Nordic items previously used by Sturgian troops and nobles (shields, weapons, armor, and helmets…) will be redistributed, and new shields will be added. Is there going to be a new attribute and 3 new skills, and can we know the names of the attribute/skills? We’re not introducing a new attribute, but War Sails will add three new naval-oriented skills, each bound to already existing attributes. Please bear in mind that some of these details may still change: “Mariner” - Enhances your personal combat prowess during naval engagements and bolsters your effectiveness in leading troops and employing tactics in sea battles - bound to Vigor and Endurance. “Boatswain” - Governs the well-being and discipline of your ship's crew, as well as the vessel's overall combat readiness, including rigging and supplies - bound to Social and Intelligence. “Shipmaster” - Improves your navigational abilities, the effectiveness of naval siege engines under your command, and the speed and quality of ship repairs and upgrades - bound to Control and Cunning. Will inland water bodies get covered with ice during winter so that they can be crossed? No. There won’t be pathfinding or traversability changes due to seasons on the world map. Will both Campaign and Sandbox modes be supported in War Sails? Yes. The Campaign mode will support both the base game's main storyline as well as the new naval questline. Will you start a new campaign with a free ship? You won’t get a free ship from the start, but you will find that smaller ones are quite affordable. Did you rework the city scenes to make docks or are these separate scenes? Ports are separate scenes accessible both through the settlement menu and from within the town scenes, much like the tavern scenes. Any chance we know how many ships we will be able to own? Technically, there will be no limit to the number of ships you can own on the campaign side, but each ship will require a certain number of troops to operate. Falling short of that number will proportionally slow down the party’s sailing speed. Additionally, as you go above a certain number of ships, you will start to incur naval campaign speed penalties. Will we have the ability to have multiple fleets? You will be able to own a single fleet consisting of multiple ships. Parties in your clan and kingdom can likewise have their own, allowing you to maintain a strong presence across the seas. Will there be a Tattoo Artist in towns where we can change our tattoos, or will it be at the same place we change...",1748861207,

In the time since, the strategy and action RPG hybrid has remained one of the best choices for players looking to blend the management aspects of medieval games like Crusader Kings 3 or Manor Lords with the more direct action of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 or Chivalry 2.

We’re thrilled to announce a major expansion to Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. War Sails will be arriving on PC and consoles (PS5, Xbox Series X/S) on the 17th of June, 2025! Watch the announcement trailer to get a first look at the intense naval warfare and epic battles that await. Wishlist now to stay updated and be ready to set sail on launch day! https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927200/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord__War_Sails/ Sail the high seas, lead mighty fleets, and forge your legacy in War Sails, the epic single-player expansion for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. Bringing naval warfare to Bannerlord for the first time, War Sails lets players command powerful ships, engage in thrilling sea battles, and master maritime conquest. Embark on daring naval adventures with new mechanics, territories, and challenges. Customize your fleet, conquer settlements, and carve your legend on the high seas! https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_RIVERS.avif MEET THE NORDS, A NEW VIKING-INSPIRED FACTION Chart your course to the Northern Kingdom, home of the fearless Nords—legendary seafarers and masters of close-quarters combat. Explore a land of jagged peaks, vast taigas and freezing fjords, where scattered settlements rise like ships from the sea. A bold adventurer may trade their goods, recruit their warriors, join their ranks or challenge their rule. Will you join the North or seize its riches? https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_NORDS.avif MASTER NAVAL WARFARE War Sails introduces a unique and immersive naval warfare system that has been inspired by accounts of actual medieval sea battles. Featuring realistic wind and water physics, ship-to-ship combat lets you board enemies from multiple points, ram them, or attack from afar. Captains can seize opportunities by boarding already engaged ships, prepare for an incoming attack by creating a floating fortress or take a risk to tie down several enemies at once - giving their allies an edge elsewhere. They may ram an enemy ship to sink it - or at least throw men off board, shatter oars and compromise buoyancy. Well-placed arrows and ballista fire can also tear through sails, further crippling mobility. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_RAMMING.avif EXPLORE AN EXPANDED WORLD Calradia has been reimagined with a northern region, a settled island, coastal waters and open seas. The dynamic weather system was also refined to include storms and trade winds. Ships move faster when riding the gales, but beware—attrition can unravel even the best-laid plans. The naval systems and Nord faction integrate into Bannerlord’s world, reshaping trade, warfare, and diplomacy. Ship production and new trade goods add regional variety. Coastal towns may grow rich from this — if they can fend off pirates and naval invasions. Sieges have also been adapted to naval warfare. Armies will have to bring along a fleet and set up a blockade, if they want to stop supplies and reinforcements arriving over sea. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_CAMPAIGN.avif BUILD YOUR FLEET Players can choose from 18 ship types modelled after historical vessels, each with unique handling, shaped by realistic wind and wave physics. They can be customized with siege engines, cargo holds, sails, rams, and more. Shipyards build and stock vessels based on their town’s culture and development. Players can also capture ships and figureheads in battle. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_Khuzait.avif EXPAND YOUR ARSENAL The character system has been extended with Nord hairstyles, beards, and tattoos. Three nautical skills were added that enhance navigation, tactics, and stewardship. There are also many new items including spears, swords, axes, shields, and armor. Troop trees now include mariner troops that are more effective at sea. Players can also recruit new companions with maritime backgrounds. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_VLANDIA.avif LEARN THE ROPES A new questline introduces players to the seas of Calradia through cinematics, scripted missions, and classic Mount & Blade gameplay. Learn how to command your ship, then take it into battle against a pirate confederacy. Lead a growing fleet of newfound allies as you face a range of nautical challenges. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/GIF_ASERAI.avif ENHANCED AUDIO The sounds of the sea come to life with new Mediterranean and Nordic-inspired musical tracks.

Singleplayer Crashes Fixed a crash that occurred when parties entered a settlement to exchange troops. Fixed a crash that occurred when the player rescued an imprisoned companion and gave them to a new party, while having a custom filter on the Party screen. Fixed a crash that occurred when riderless mounts tried to find a retreat position. Fixed a crash that occurred due to a deprecated policy being referenced in map notifications. Fixed a crash that occurred when assigning traits to teen heroes. Fixed a crash that occurred when talking to someone through the Clan screen while being in a settlement. Fixed a crash that occurred when trying to attack the besieger party after accepting a peace offer from that same enemy faction. Fixed a crash that occurred when a raid of a village that had no notables finished. Fixed a crash that occurred when a settlement claimant decision was canceled. Fixed a crash that occurred when entering missions or the campaign map. Fixed a crash that occurred when ending the mercenary contract through dialogue. Fixes Fixed a bug that prevented the player from leaving a siege after making peace with the enemy as an independent clan. Fixed a bug that caused party roles to be reset after the Rival Gang Leader quest battle. Fixed a bug that caused the town’s security to increase on success rather than decrease (and the other way around) during the Bounty Hunter quest. Fixed a bug that caused the courtship to end due to the player being in an army. Changes Certain Aserai helmets that were previously unavailable in shops have been made accessible. Multiplayer Crashes Fixed a crash that occurred when exiting the lobby as the News items were loading. Fixes Fixed a bug that prevented the player from speeding its mount up after dying and taking control of another unit in Captain mode. Fixed a bug that prevented the LogOutputPath launch argument from working for Dedicated Servers - now replaced with LocalOutputDir. Changes A multiplayer refactor that represents a deeper technical change towards a more scalable infrastructure has gone Live over a week ago. We expect it to provide greater flexibility in the backend development, help with our long-term server support, and resolve several issues with services not scaling appropriately during heavy load - i.e. it should help with lobby connectivity during a sudden increase in player numbers during f.e. an event.

Before we highlight the new creations and events, we would like to share more on the progress of the v1.2.x version series. Recently, we’ve released Beta v1.2.5 which addressed a plethora of issues, brought improvements to the settlement garrison balance and tweaked the combat AI by introducing a larger fighting skill gap between lower and higher skilled troops. Furthermore, Dedicated Server files have been made available for Beta, we’ve made a number of balance adjustments based on your feedback and added the ability to favorite servers. Finally, modders can now explore the new and improved moddability of the World Map, the bulk shader compilation (which reduces module loading times) as well as the ability to define and use your own decals. Finally, as 1.2.5 grew larger than expected, the previous November cross-platform release estimate will likely not be met. Having said that, this month still saw significant progress towards a release in the next few weeks. We appreciate everyone’s understanding and continued support as we strive to deliver a stable and well-rounded patch. A big thank you to everyone who has provided feedback, reported a bug or uploaded a dump report.

261550,"Development Update #12: Weather System, Formation Targeting and Warehouses","Greetings warriors of Calradia! In this development update, we have a look at some of the post-release highlights that were introduced in the current live version 1.1.0 as well as our recent Steam Beta version 1.2.0. The text version can be found below. ART NEW BATTLE TERRAINS To start, let’s jump right into our new scene additions. We have introduced an additional six battle terrains, bringing the total to 76 unique battle scenes. They are accessible at the following locations: West of Revyl, southwest of Quyaz, three terrains northeast of Razih, and one around the town of Odohk. NEW HIDEOUT SCENES Similarly, bandit hideouts now come in greater variety with 4 new scenes that span desert, forest, seaside, and mountain environments. NEW ARMOR PIECES To help you clear out those hideouts with ease - we also added 3 new armor pieces - Ornate Scale Armor, Khan's Coat of Plates, and Khan's Plated Bracers. CAMPAIGN MAP WEATHER & WEATHER EFFECTS We have introduced rain and snow weather effects to both world map and missions. These occur depending on the season of a specific region. Consequently, the grounds become wet or snowy and this lingers for a period even after the precipitation is gone. This not only enhances the overall atmosphere of the game but adds a lot of variety to the map and all of the scenes. But that’s not all. Wet or snowy grounds noticeably decrease mounted infantry and cavalry party speed bonuses. They also double the siege preparation time. As a result, winter campaigns should now prove to be more challenging. Moving on to the missions, wet or snowy grounds reduce the maximum speed and acceleration of mounts. And finally, if it happens to be actively raining or snowing, that reduces the speed of arrows and bolts, resulting in reduced damage and accuracy of archers and crossbowmen. AUDIO NEW VOICEOVERS Joining the already present Vlandian, Battanian, and Empire voiceovers, you can now experience distinctive voices when interacting with individuals of the Aserai, Khuzait, and Sturgian heritage. SIEGE ENGINE SOUNDS Siege engine sounds have also been revamped, so let me quiet down while you listen to the trebuchets and mangonels rain terror on those defenders. UI FOG OF WAR In version 1.1.0, we introduced a fog of war mechanic to our encyclopedia. This meant that information was no longer universally available, but would require you to meet characters or scout settlements to see their critical information. FOG OF WAR IMPROVEMENTS Our recent Beta builds upon this foundation by introducing new methods of unveiling the masked details. Taking into account community feedback, we have added the ability to pay the tavern keeper to learn more about a settlement's clan. At the same time, we have also integrated existing features with the system. Asking the tavern keeper about companions, receiving a marriage offer from another clan, or asking a lord about eligible bachelors now all unlocks the information of these characters in the encyclopedia. Marriage offers, in particular, also benefit from a new screen that does the occasion greater justice. BATTLES AND SIEGES SALLY OUT AMBUSH “Sally Out Ambush” missions have been added. Sharpen your blades, wear your best armor, mount your steed, and rush out of the settlement under siege with your cavalry - ambushing the attackers and destroying their siege engines in the process. But take note of time, for as the enemy realizes what is happening, they’ll send reinforcements to protect their siege towers and other equipment. PUSHABLE SIEGE LADDERS Siege ladders can now be pushed off the walls in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer even if there are troops on the ladder already. Picture this: you’re in the middle of a violent siege, eager to jump the walls, and just as you’re about to ascend, the defenders push the ladder back with a few of your comrades-in-arms falling to their demise. A shocking scene that must have been fairly common in medieval sieges. MELEE COMBAT AI We reworked the melee AI to make agents fight less recklessly and increase the duration of combat. The changes include a decrease of attack frequency, always blocking when within enemy strike range, and a faster target reevaluation when hit by another enemy. Troops now also detect the risk of becoming surrounded and attempt to escape such situations. Finally, additional logic has been added to preemptively raise the shield when running towards an enemy that’s preparing to shoot a projectile at them. RANGED COMBAT AI Ranged units were not ignored either. They no longer approach the enemy unnecessarily during a charge. Instead, they get in range and open fire until they run out of munition. They also reposition if their view is obstructed by a friendly agent or a tree. TARGETING SYSTEM The overall targeting system was refined to improve situations where agents would prioritize the player despite having better targets. This benefits melee, mounted, and ranged troops. CAVALRY COMBAT AI Cavalry AI likewise...",1687963041,

Fixed a bug that caused a save to get corrupted when overwriting save files. Old saves might still be corrupted when overwriting (this includes auto-save), so make sure to create a new save file (choose ""save as"") for any existing saves that you want to safeguard. Fixed a bug that prevented the deletion of corrupted save files. Reduced the save file limit from 32 to 16 to allow for larger files without corruption. If you have more than 16 save files, this will not delete your files. It will only prevent you from creating new files until you are below 16 again. You can overwrite all existing files. Changes Siege Engine Changes Decreased the minimum firing range of all mangonels, allowing them to shoot closer targets. This also makes higher walls not so detrimental for defending mangonels. Regular mangonels with multiple projectiles Increased the number of projectiles. Decreased the single-hit damage of each stone. Decreased the damage area of each projectile. Regular mangonels are still effective against troops but no longer overshadow their fire mangonel counterparts. Fire mangonels Slightly increased the area of effect. Increased the damage reduction towards the edges of the hit area. Increased the hit damage of a projectile. It’s harder to hit enemy engines or formations with them in comparison to the regular mangonel but the payout is much better. Not every unit hit by the fire mangonel will die due to the increased damage reduction towards the edges of the hit area. AI targeting behaviour of mangonels Mangonels now prioritize the battering ram and siege towers when choosing a target. Afterwards, they try to attack clumps of enemies. Fire mangonels now primarily target enemy troops. Trebuchets Increased the number of projectiles. Decreased the single-hit damage of each stone. Decreased the damage area of each projectile. We are working on further improvements to them. Battering rams and siege towers Increased the hit points of battering rams and siege towers (to compensate for the decreased mangonel minimum range).AI behaviour of ranged siege engines The AI now properly leads targets. Improved the overall accuracy calculation, resulting in fewer over or undershooting. Adjusted the target boxes of siege towers. Defending mangonels can now target them when they are closer. Troop AI Changes Attacking archers now use line formation spacing instead of tight formation spacing when taking positions. Defending troops now start on walls as the siege begins. Multiplayer Crashes Fixed a crash that occurred due to shield inverse kinematics not being fully synchronized with the server. Fixed a server crash that occurred on crowded servers when picking up an item from the ground. ",1672937325,

Reduced the save file limit from 32 to 16 to allow for larger files without corruption. If you have more than 16 save files, this will not delete your files. It will only prevent you from creating new files until you are below 16 again. You can overwrite all existing files. Changes Siege Engine Changes Decreased the minimum firing range of all mangonels, allowing them to shoot closer targets. This also makes higher walls not so detrimental for defending mangonels. Regular mangonels with multiple projectiles Increased the number of projectiles. Decreased the single-hit damage of each stone. Decreased the damage area of each projectile. Regular mangonels are still effective against troops but no longer overshadow their fire mangonel counterparts. Fire mangonels Slightly increased the area of effect. Increased the damage reduction towards the edges of the hit area. Increased the hit damage of a projectile. It’s harder to hit enemy engines or formations with them in comparison to the regular mangonel but the payout is much better. Not every unit hit by the fire mangonel will die due to the increased damage reduction towards the edges of the hit area. AI targeting behaviour of mangonels Mangonels now prioritize the battering ram and siege towers when choosing a target. Afterwards, they try to attack clumps of enemies. Fire mangonels now primarily target enemy troops. Trebuchets Increased the number of projectiles. Decreased the single-hit damage of each stone. Decreased the damage area of each projectile. We are working on further improvements to them. Battering rams and siege towers Increased the hit points of battering rams and siege towers (to compensate for the decreased mangonel minimum range).AI behaviour of ranged siege engines The AI now properly leads targets. Improved the overall accuracy calculation, resulting in fewer over or undershooting. Adjusted the target boxes of siege towers. Defending mangonels can now target them when they are closer. Troop AI Changes Attacking archers now use line formation spacing instead of tight formation spacing when taking positions. Defending troops now start on walls as the siege begins. Multiplayer Crashes Fixed a crash that occurred due to shield inverse kinematics not being fully synchronized with the server. Fixed a server crash that occurred on crowded servers when picking up an item from the ground. ",1672412041,['patchnotes']
261550,Robbing from the rich in Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord,"There&apos;s an ancient, established tradition of folk tales featuring outlaw heroes. In Britain we have Hereward the Wake and Robin Hood. The US has Davy Crockett and Wyatt Earp. And in China there&apos;s an entire genre of writing, called Youxia (literally &apos;wandering vigilante&apos;), devoted to tales about men who travel the land writing wrongs and protecting the weak. But is it possible to live this way in Mount & Blade 2? To eschew the feudal trappings of land and power in favour of a life spent living on the road, fighting injustice? Yes. To roam the forests, waiting to strike out against the rich, lazy, and powerful? Also yes, but to a lesser extent.

Inspired by Marco Polo’s and Ibn Battuta’s travel books, it follows the journey of Asoios across Calradia, a scribe tasked by Istiana with travelling the lands and reporting his observations to her. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/b89758532b8da0cb24e61cce13eee374f84816ef.png A hand-drawn map of the game world with many little details and a selection of concept art for every culture will allow for your own exploration as well. Coupled with pictures of the development & developers, these offer a glance behind the scenes of the creative process that brought forth the acclaimed and long-anticipated sequel to Warband. https://cdn.taleworlds.com/upload/news/digital_companion_release_map.png Finally, the application includes a collection of the game’s music that you can listen to while exploring the content. In celebration of our recent launch and as a thank you for your support throughout the early access, we are gifting the Companion to everyone that has purchased the game on PC up until this time. Going forward, the Companion will be available for $9.99 /€9.99 and the Digital Deluxe edition for $59.99 /€59.99 - though there will be a launch discount of 30% on PC and 20% on consoles during the holiday season (until January 5th). On Steam and GoG, owners will be able to select the Companion from within the game’s launcher. If you purchase it on Epic, Windows Store or consoles, it will appear as a separate application in your library. The Digital Companion texts are fully localized to all the languages available in the game. We hope that you will enjoy our (slightly premature) Christmas present and are looking forward to seeing you in our next development update!",1671216283,
261550,Bannerlord Creative Competition 2 Winners,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/e8a26e2c1f586a05d4689e2716e7ee3b8d50601a.png Greetings warriors of Calradia! We were very excited back in April, when we announced the second iteration of the Bannerlord Creative Competition, with the first one bringing many modders and creators together to turn in their submissions. We were amazed by the quality of creations and the variety of ideas brought to the table back then, and that hasn’t changed with the second iteration. We’re thrilled to report that many modders answered the call. After a thorough evaluation conducted by our developers, we’re now pleased to be sharing the winners of the Bannerlord Creative Competition 2! It brought new challenges for the participants in the form of three contents - designing hideout scenes, producing royal melee weapon sets and making a comic set in the Dark Ages of Calradia. Scene Design Contest - Hideouts Scene designers were invited to create a hideout, a sanctuary for thieving bandits who prey on the innocent that pass through the surrounding lands. The hideout mission is only reachable during the night - which is something the contest participants had to keep in mind while designing their submissions. Our judges were attentive to the composition of the scene props, the quality of the ground texture and painting work, terrain realism, how well the scene plays out in a hideout mission and the use of new and fresh concepts while designing the look and setting of the scene. 3rd Place Without further ado, let’s begin with the Scene Design Contest’s third place, achieved by Athaelas for their scene Abandoned Mine. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/5081fac2a24cf9c41dbe7200e00a9fb102ebc319.png Abandoned Mine by Athaelas The name suits the scene very well! We feel that the linear layout combined with ample torches to guide the player creates for an effortless bandit cleaning of the hideout. The location of the player spawn sets a great tone for the rest of the scene. It keeps the player entertained through unique touches such as the remnants of the mine, a great crane location that overlooks the hideout and the tree full of pottery and bags - which it seems like was used for target practice by the Steppe Bandits. 2nd Place Moving on, let’s take a look at the scene that won second place, the Battanian Burial Mound created by Klassix. Placed in the middle of a swamp, surrounded by deep forests, the player finds himself combating the formidable Forest Bandits. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/e99070882e1dabf6d1efad71c70bb2284d85f1a2.png Battanian Burial Mound by Klassix This scene captures the artistic style of Battania very well, making great use of the lights and fog to guide the player through the swamps. The great placement of invisible barriers prevent the player from wandering into unintended areas while keeping sufficient movement freedom. The AI troops can seamlessly move to every corner of the scene with the help of the well made navigation mesh. The hideout boss fight unfolds in the tumb, which is very thoroughly detailed through a smart re-usage of assets in creative ways, not to mention the crack in the ceiling which fills the room with moonlight. The overall atmosphere of the scene feels fantastic, making this for a great second place! 1st Place And the winner’s cup goes to Levente and their scene Valeria Lookout! It’s most impressive when eying it for the first time, utilising a vertical layout to bring uniqueness to both the gameplay and visuals of the scene. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26623866/77228a9264bcf6639baafce3bfe1d8f80a3237b6.png Valeria Lookout by Levente The impressive backdrop gives a sense of scale, with the homesteads and castle seen in the distance. The mission can be approached via two different paths without skipping any of the bandit locations and not having to backtrack which is quite impressive. It was great to see that a lot of work went into the details and placement of assets, bringing the scene to life. For example, the manually created shooting star in the sky, the flying birds and the gaps above the caves. Oh yeah, did we mention the cave system? After fighting your way through the narrow paths, you find yourself in an open cave full of Mountain Bandits that can’t wait to throw you over the ledge. And this is where we get to the final boss fight which just happens to have one of the best views of the lands in the background. An awesome location to wrap up the hideout! Other Winners OldVlandiaTown by ErdemliYns Urban Hideout by Sheepbitter Smuggler's Descent by dbwuh Ruined Castle Hideout by ImToni Brigands Keep by Ceftadzime Shipwreck Cove by Kazet Ruins of Erandel by Shishya Scene Pack You can check out all of the winners as well as other entries on our forums, where you can also download the scenes and enjoy them during your next playthrough. 3D Art Contest - Melee Weapons Set Next up, we have the 3D art contest.
