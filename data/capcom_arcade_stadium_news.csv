There are more old games coming to the collection in the future, too. There are already plenty of options in the collection to let you customise your experience, including save states, rewind features, and difficulty swaps. However, you can't straight-up turn on an invincibility cheat - at least, not until the $0.99 USD DLC featuring invincibility mode launches alongside the Steam version of the collection.
