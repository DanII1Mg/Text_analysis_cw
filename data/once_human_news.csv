2139460,Dev Blog丨RaidZone Experience Optimization,"Dear Metas,The unique charm of the RaidZone Scenario lies in the strategic combat interplay between players. To this end, we are rolling out a major experience update exclusively for RaidZone, designed to create a more focused, purer, and more immersive PvP wilderness stage for Metas, one that truly reflects the harsh realities of apocalyptic survival combat.We’ve observed that the current progression pace in RaidZone is overly rigid, lacking variability and surprise, with insufficient depth in survival mechanics. To address this, we’ve initiated a full-scale progression overhaul, covering technological advancement, wilderness resource acquisition, crafting formulas and production costs, item naming, and Memetic systems. Our goal is to refine the overall pacing of RaidZone, enhance survival-oriented gameplay, improve wilderness PvP and territory battles, and ensure competitive fairness and strategic retrusion, bringing the focus back to the battle of wits between players and their environment in a post-apocalyptic world.Below are the detailed optimizations： Ⅰ. Memetic ChangesThe current Memetic system suffers from unclear tech paths, ambiguous categorization, and numerous redundant nodes, all of which detract from the experience. This update will significantly optimize RaidZone’s Memetic system, allowing players to better understand what they can craft/build at different tech levels while providing clearer progression visibility.1. Memetic tabs have been reclassified into three categories: Construction, Combat, and Survival, aligned with RaidZone’s core experience for easier comprehension by Metas.2. The Memetic screen now displays tier indicators to denote formula levels, showing which items can be crafted at corresponding tier supplies workbenches or gear workbenches, making tech progression more intuitive.3. The nail gun, bronze pickaxe, steel ingot, tungsten ingot, sulfur crystal, all stone structures, and synthesis benches are now unlocked by default, with their associated Memetics removed. These no longer require data chips to learn and are freely accessible.4. The ore detector Memetic has been removed.5. Remove the mining operation platform Memetic and all material-type Memetics. For batch production/construction abilities, players must first collect the corresponding facility or item in the wilderness, then reverse-engineer and learn its formula through the synthesis bench.6. Memetic pins will now display the icon of the primary formula item within that Memetic node for better clarity. Additionally, the name will be updated to match the unlocked formula item.II. New Reverse-Engineering FeatureWe aim to provide players with richer, more diverse progression paths, avoiding rigid growth solely tied to Memetic unlocks. We also don’t want Memetic learning to be the only way for players to gain survival skills in RaidZones. This update links player ability progression and formula acquisition to random wilderness drops, offering more survival possibilities through randomly generated items.1. Added a reverse-engineering feature. Most crafting materials, weapons, armor, and building facilities can now be reverse-engineered by consuming one finished product plus RaidZone chips to unlock their crafting ability early.2. Reverse-engineering requires at least three steps: First, build a synthesis bench facility (unlocked by default; any team member or interactable synthesis bench from a Meta can enable this feature). Second, acquire the finished item or building item whose formula you wish to learn. Finally, gather enough chips to initiate reverse-engineering.3. Once all materials are ready, deposit the finished or building item into the synthesis bench and consume the required chips. After a set duration, the item’s formula will be learned, allowing batch production or construction.4. Reverse-engineering consumes the deposited item and chips permanently. These items will not be returned, so perform this operation in a safe environment.5. Note: Not all items can be reverse-engineered. Attempting to reverse-engineer an already learned formula will not grant the item’s formula again but will instead consume the item and chips to yield a small amount of basic materials.III. Item and Material AdjustmentsWe have observed that the current offense-defense dynamics in the RaidZone have room for optimization. To ensure Metas can fully enjoy the entire journey from survival construction to strategic confrontation, we have decided to implement a major balance adjustment to the combat system. Our goal is to provide all players with a more profound and rewarding experience.In this update, we will redesign and standardize the cost ratio between flammable items and player-built structures, optimizing the expenses for territory construction and flammable production. This ensures more players can level up their walls to resist DMG from explosives. Additionally, through the following adjustments, we aim to preserve the core gamepl...",1765967246,['enable_steam_china']

2139460,Dev Blog | Mod System Overhaul and Compensation Plan,"Dear Metas,The mod system is a core progression mechanic in Once Human, constituting a major portion of a character's combat power. Many players have invested much time and effort into acquiring and upgrading mods, making them crucial assets. However, we've consistently received feedback about several issues, such as the difficulty of obtaining certain mod sub-attributes, the system being confusing for new players, and upgrades having insufficient impact. The roots of these issues are:a) Mod sub-attributes are randomly generated. Once Human allows for a wide variety of playstyles, and every player has different needs. This means that obtaining mods with a specific level and sub-attributes is inherently difficult and luck-dependent.b) There is a wide variety of mod attributes and sub-attributes. This offers flexibility in developing builds, but currently lacks clear in-game guidance, resulting in a steep barrier to entry for new players.c) The rarity of a mod's sub-attribute is determined by its raw numerical strength. If too strong, it leads to excessive strength or large power gaps between players. If too low, it leads to a lack of noticeable progression.These three fundamental issues make it difficult to improve the mod system through basic optimizations, such as a guarantee system for sub-attributes or a more detailed guide. After careful consideration, we began planning an overhaul of the mod system in early 2025. Our goal is to solve the issues mentioned above at their roots while rebalancing them for both old and new players. After several months of planning, development, and testing, we will be launching the overhauled mod system on January 21, 2026 (PT). In this blog, we'll detail our optimization plan and reveal a compensation package for existing players.We deeply value your opinions and feedback. If you have any suggestions regarding our plans, please let us know via the Co-Dev Feedback Platform. We promise to review all feedback and use it to improve our plan. Mod System Optimization PlanOur optimization plan has two core objectives. Firstly, we want to make the mod system easier to understand and use for new players. Secondly, we want to reduce the randomness involved in acquiring and upgrading mods, allowing you to acquire mods with your desired attributes more reliably, while retaining the experience of pursuing rare mods. We also want to keep the core feature of transferring mods between scenarios to safeguard your long-term progression.1. Mods Field Guide: Easily Keep Track of Your ModsAdded a Mods Field Guide. All mods will be categorized by part and build in the Field Guide. This makes it easier for you to learn about all available mods and develop your own playstyle.When you obtain a mod, its Field Guide entry will be unlocked. Mods still have levels from Lv. 1 to Lv. 17, displayed in the top-left of their entries. The Field Guide will display the highest-level mod you have ever obtained of each type, allowing you to equip it. Duplicate low-level mods of the same type will be automatically disassembled into Mod Dust, which can be used to redeem Random Mod Crates in the Shop.2. Fixed Sub-Attributes and Shiny Mods: Simpler and Clearer Mod Progressiona) Overhauled mods will retain the same main attributes. The four sub-attributes will no longer be randomly generated, but fixed to match the mod's core traits.b) Mod level is determined by the sum of a mod's sub-attribute levels, up to a maximum of Lv .17. Thus, a higher mod level means higher sub-attribute levels. The mod level will be displayed on the mod icon for easier access and management.c) After obtaining a Lv. 17 mod, you may randomly obtain Shiny mods from specific high-difficulty dungeons or game modes. A Shiny mod has the same sub-attributes as a Lv. 17 mod, but its main attribute will be slightly higher. The icons and information panels of Shiny mods will be visually distinct from those of regular mods, allowing players to show off their achievements.* Shiny mods have a low and random chance of dropping. Only some Shiny mods will be available in the January 21 (PT) update, with more to be added afterward.Table 1: Mod Level and Attribute Level Correlation ChartMod RarityMod LevelSub-Attribute 1 LevelSub-Attribute 2 LevelSub-Attribute 3 LevelSub-Attribute 4 LevelCommon11000Common21100Uncommon31110Uncommon41111Rare52111Rare62211Epic72221Epic82222Legendary93222Legendary103322Legendary113332Legendary124332Legendary134432Legendary144442Legendary155442Legendary165542Legendary1755523.

Additionally, you can spend Mod Dust and Energy Links to redeem Random Mod Crates of varying level ranges from the Shop.4.

2139460,Dev Blog | Pre-Selection and Other Permanent Server Optimizations Coming Soon,"Dear Metas,We've received thousands of suggestions regarding permanent servers since their official launch. We deeply value your continued support, and your feedback is crucial to helping us improve the game.After evaluating your feedback, we've planned a series of optimizations for permanent servers, to be implemented in phases. The December 10(PT) and December 23(PT) version updates will address the most pressing issues you've raised, such as resource transfers, pre-selection for permanent servers, improved rules, and more.I. Supply Points Monthly Reset for Permanent ServersAfter the December 10(PT) update, Supply Points will be reset every month on all permanent servers. This will make it easier for players on permanent servers to try newly released content. The rules are as follows:1. At 12:00 AM (server time) on the 1st of every month, players on permanent servers will have their Supply Points reset to the maximum of 20,000, allowing players more flexibility in transferring resources. The next reset will take place at 6:00 AM on January 1, 2026.2. You can view your current Supply Points and the next reset time in Backpack > Inherit Resources.II. Pre-Selection for Permanent ServersSince permanent servers have a player capacity limit, players from the same scenario server may be assigned to different permanent servers based on their login time. This results in players being separated from their friends. After the December 23(PT) update, pre-selection for permanent servers will be available, guaranteeing that you and your friends can remain together!Rules:1. Individual and Hive Pre-Selection: You can pre-select a permanent server either individually or as a Hive. Hive pre-selection can be initiated by the Hive leader. If successful, all Hive members will be assigned to the selected permanent server during the server merge.Note:a) The Hive leader cannot initiate Hive pre-selection if any member has already pre-selected a server individually. Conversely, if the Hive leader has already initiated Hive pre-selection, any member who wants to pre-select a server individually must first leave the Hive.b) Permanent server pre-selection and scenario sign-up cannot be performed simultaneously. You must choose one according to your needs.2. Reservation System: After completing pre-selection, your place on the selected server will be reserved for 14 days. If you do not log in within 14 days, your pre-selection will expire, and your place will be released.3. Server Assignment: If you do not pre-select a server, your character will be automatically assigned to the server with the most remaining capacity during the server merge.4. Pre-Selection Limitations: You can only pre-select a permanent server of the same scenario type as your character's current server. For example, if your character is in a standard Manibus server, you can only pre-select a standard Manibus permanent server. You cannot choose a server with a different scenario or Visional Wheel status.III. Updated Permanent Server Scenario Challenge RulesTo better align the Scenario Challenge experience with player progress, an updated Scenario Challenge system will be introduced to permanent servers after the December 23(PT) update. The key improvements are as follows:1. Adjusted Unlock Conditions: Scenario Challenge tasks will be unlocked by collecting the required amount of Memetic Points rather than reaching a specific scenario phase.* Due to system adjustments, we plan to optimize the Scenario Challenge unlock conditions again in January 2026. This will not affect the progress or status of existing tasks. For more information, please refer to subsequent announcements regarding the planned adjustments.2. Task Progress Resets: Immediately after the update, all Scenario Challenge tasks on permanent servers will be replaced with new tasks and rewards, and all task progress will be reset.3. Server Merge Synchronization Rules: Following the update, when a character joins a permanent server during a server merge, all their Scenario Challenge tasks will be replaced with the permanent server's tasks and rewards, and all task progress will be reset.IV. Closure of PvP Scenario Permanent ServersWe've received much feedback regarding Evolution's Call and Prismverse's Clash permanent servers, citing issues such as too few active players for matchmaking and compromised fairness. Our data confirms that there are usually fewer than 50 active players on permanent servers for these two scenarios. This is insufficient to support a healthy PvP environment and has caused confusion and frustration for our players. After careful consideration, we've decided to close all PvP scenario permanent servers on January 8, 2026. The details are as follows:1. PvP Server Closure Notice: After the December 10(PT) update, a PvP permanent server closing event will be launched on the Event interface. Characters currently on the Evolution's Call or Prismverse's Clash PvP permanent servers can regi...",1765193730,['enable_steam_china']

2139460,Dev Blog | Visional Wheel S2: Lunar Revelry – New Event and Rule Adjustments,"Dear Metas,The crimson moon rises once more, enveloping Nalcott with even greater power. Having previously proved their strength, Metas must now race to complete a more formidable challenge where red moonlight and dark shadows meet.Crimson Night Showdown, the new event for Visional Wheel S2: Lunar Revelry, is coming, together with changes to the Lunacy rules!Crimson Night ShowdownEvent Period: December 10 – January 21 (PT)1. Event Rulesa) This event features three dungeons: Red Vulture Combat Zone, Esoteric Altar, and Hunting Grounds. Each dungeon includes 10 floors. You must defeat all enemies in the dungeon to complete it. Enemies grow stronger and more aggressive with each floor. This is the ultimate trial of your strength! (Spoiler alert: It's very difficult!)b) Red Vulture Combat Zone will be unlocked after the December 10 (PT) update. One remaining dungeon will be unlocked each week thereafter.c) When the third dungeon is unlocked, leaderboards for each dungeon will also become available. Players will be ranked based on their fastest dungeon completion times, and ranking rewards will be issued when the event ends.2. Dungeon Rulesa) Each dungeon can be challenged solo or as a team. Solo and team completions are independently timed and ranked.b) Both players and enemies are affected by Lunacy inside the dungeons.c) Each dungeon features distinct enemy traits and types, requiring different tactical approaches.d) All items and techs (e.g., mods, Cradle) in your Backpack can be brought into the dungeon. However, only three Adrenaline Shots can be used per dungeon attempt.e) Each dungeon consists of 10 floors. You must defeat all enemies on all 10 floors to complete the dungeon.3. Rewardsa) Each dungeon includes various challenge tasks. Complete them to claim their rewards from the event interface.b) After completing a dungeon, a loot crate will spawn. Open it to obtain Lunar and Crescent mod crates.c) Push your limits and climb the leaderboard. When the event ends, you'll earn trophy collectibles and other exclusive rewards.4. Additional RulesDungeons accessed from Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve will have modified difficulty and independent leaderboards. This is to ensure fairness, as the scenario features unique techs.Lunacy and Other Rule AdjustmentsPreviously, Lunacy was automatically inflicted during Lunar Revelry events, resulting in high survival pressure. We conducted a poll on how to optimize this mechanic with two options: A: Lunar Revelry events no longer inflict Lunacy. You must use a Lunacy Stimulant to gain the Lunacy status. Lunacy Stimulants require fewer materials to craft. B: Lunar Revelry events still inflict Lunacy. The Lunacy Suppressant formula is unlocked by default. Lunacy Suppressants require fewer materials to craft. After collating results across all platforms, Option B received slightly more votes than Option A.Based on this outcome, while also considering players who prefer not to be affected by Lunacy, we will make the following adjustments in the December 10(PT) update:1. During a Lunar Revelry event, players will still be automatically inflicted with Lunacy. However, Lunacy can be permanently cured by using a Lunacy Suppressant.2. If you want to be afflicted with Lunacy again, you must use a Lunacy Stimulant.3. The Lunacy Stimulant and Lunacy Suppressant formulas will be available in the Visional Wheel redemption shop for convenient purchase.4. The amounts and types of materials required to craft Lunacy Stimulants and Lunacy Suppressants will be reduced.5. Additional NotesThe updated Lunacy Suppressant only protects you from Lunacy (i.e., your Sanity will not fall due to the Blood Moon). Lunar Revelry events will still change the wilderness rules and cause Deviants to be affected by Lunacy.Additionally, there are several existing ways to prevent Lunacy and control the game's pace:1. Lunar Revelry incidents do not occur on non-Visional Wheel servers, so players will not be inflicted with Lunacy.2. On Visional Wheel servers, Lunar Loot Crates will yield the Lunacy Suppressant formula. Lunacy Suppressants can be used to prevent Lunacy.Thank you for your feedback and suggestions!That's all for this Dev Blog.

2139460,"Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve – Scenario Official Launch and Optimizatio","Dear Metas,Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve launches on October 29(PT)! Since the start of Early Access on September 24(PT), we've received lots of feedback and suggestions regarding this scenario, which has given us clear direction. Thank you for helping to make Once Human better!Welcome to the world of Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve!Scenario IntroductionDeviations are a crucial element of Once Human. They are much loved and sought after by Metas, making them one of the game's most important aspects. In the Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve scenario, Deviations take center stage. They'll appear all over the world, each with a unique ecosystem and habits, and will even fight by your side. In this scenario, finding ideal Deviation companions is crucial to progression. This unique mechanic delivers a fun experience that's completely different from other scenarios.In this world, Deviations can be found everywhere, living in harmony with the world. You must discover their habitats, craft special capturing tools, and assemble a Deviation squad to grow stronger with you!Here, the Symbiosis System will be unlocked, offering fun and relaxing progression. There's also a new PvE and PvP game mode: Deviation battles. You can challenge NPCs in arenas or engage in real-time competitive duels with other survivors.Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve is a new standalone scenario, meaning your stats on other scenarios don't apply here. This means that veteran Metas and newcomers alike will have the same fun experience in this scenario! Join Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve now and embark on the path to becoming a Securement Master!New TasksThere are many more tasks compared to the Early Access version, helping you to familiarize yourself with this new world!1. Main Story TasksDeviation: Survive, Capture, PreserveEnter a fantastical world where Deviations of all shapes and sizes live in harmony with humans, leading to the creation of a unique combat system. As a Securement Expert, you must collect powerful Deviations, challenge the Deviation League, and become the greatest Securement Master in the land.2. Side Story TasksMastery of SecurementThe path to becoming a Securement Master isn't easy. During your journey, you'll encounter setbacks and confusion. But when you hit a bottleneck, you'll meet your best friend in this world—Zeno. Together, you'll explore the liminal space between chaos and order, developing your skills and enduring crises. Investigate the secrets of chaos, uncover the truth behind the Deviations' frenzy, and protect the future of countless Deviations.Call of ChaosTo stop the spread of chaos, Lowe tasks you with investigating the chaos gyms and giant Deviations. During the mission, however, you encounter a young boy who desperately needs help, sparking off a high-stakes wager concerning faith and chaos.Early Access OptimizationsThank you participating in Early Access for Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve! More than 240,000 Metas joined the test, playing more than 3,000,000 hours in total! Other than receiving your feedback, we also observed some interesting statistics:- Everyone's a Securement Master! During Early Access, you captured a total of 6,677,319 Deviations, fought in 6,248,761 arena battles, and fused Deviations 724,610 times! We hope you found your favorite Deviation and formed the strongest combat team!- The Deviation used most in the arena was Atomic Snail, deployed a total of 6,191,788 times during Early Access! A true workaholic king!- The Deviation caught the most was The Digby Boy, captured 425,740 times during Early Access! Try running faster, Digby Boy! You have legs, don't you?During Early Access, we received 5,482 pieces of feedback on the Co-Dev Feedback Platform. Based on your suggestions, we've implemented the following optimizations for the official launch of Deviation: Survive, Capture, Preserve:1. Symbiosis Systema) Optimized the Symbiosis System access point. Added a button to the Symbiosis System below the scenario's main interface, making it easier to find and use the system.b) Adjusted the Symbiosis Level. Increased the maximum Symbiosis Level from 5 to 10 and reduced the value requirement for each level, making progression more balanced.c) Adjusted Deviation values. In addition to their inherent attributes, each Deviation's level now also affects their value. This makes it easier to reach value milestones in the late game.d) Adjusted Deviation abilities. The level of captured Deviations now scales with your Symbiosis Level. Deviation abilities will also scale to match your Symbiosis Level. This means that your Symbiosis Level will determine how strong your Deviations are.e) In each Deviation's information in the Symbiosis System, you can now view recommended lineups and skill information.f) Added Deviation habitat information to the Symbiosis System.g) Tech Memetics in the scenario are no longer locked by scenario progression.

2139460,Dev Blog | Details About Four New Deviations!,"Hi, Metas!The October 29(PT) update is almost here! In this Dev Blog, we're bringing first-hand information on the new Deviations. Let's take a look!I. Combat Deviation: Whalepup O-055Deviation O-055 is a quadrupedal vertebrate that resembles a juvenile orca. It measures approximately 1.3 meters long and weighs about 175 kilograms, and its stubby limbs are tipped with claws.O-055 exhibits behavior similar to large canines, with an intelligence level comparable to that of a six-year-old child. It can understand researchers' instructions and respond by spelling out words. Playful and curious by nature, it is friendly to humans and enjoys interacting with researchers. However, it often disobeys instructions or plays pranks.O-055 has an uncontrollable shapeshifting ability. If it has no contact with seawater for 24 hours, it transforms into a massive and hostile wolf-like entity (henceforth O-055-A). O-055-A is approximately 9.6 meters long and weighs about 10 tons. It exhibits immense strength, quick reflexes, and exceptional physical and biochemical resilience. O-055-A displays extreme aggression and an insatiable hunger toward all warm-blooded organisms, with clear evidence of surplus killing as it hunts.The primary Deviation Trait of O-055 and O-055-A is their shared ability to restructure matter. O-055 can convert all non-living materials within a 6-meter spherical radius into saltwater with a salinity of about 3.47%; the radius is extended to roughly 15 kilometers when used by O-055-A. Both O-055 and O-055-A can use this ability to swim along or through solid matter. While O-055 typically uses this ability to play hide-and-seek, O-055-A employs it to ambush unsuspecting prey.Summon Effect:Summon Whalepup to convert the battlefield into an underwater world. Inside this world, both Metas and Whalepup deal increased damage and immobilize enemies hit with water currents. II. Combat Deviation: Soul Summoner O-056Deviation O-056 is a combination of a red, oval spruce mask and a wolf skull with white fur. The mask has simple eye slits, while bone horns extend from both sides of the wolf skull's sagittal crest. It has a steady surface temperature of between 37°C and 39°C.O-056's primary Deviation Trait is its ability to manifest objects. Whether worn or not, O-056 passively generates translucent entities that vaguely resemble birds and beasts. These entities (designated O-056-A) are composed of unknown particles in a condensed state and can freely alter their density to pass through most solid objects. They also display strength and resilience far greater than that of real animals.When O-056 is not worn, O-056-A will seek out male humans aged between ██ and ██ and attempt to make them wear O-056. O-056-A will attack any individual or object that obstructs the achievement of this goal.When O-056 is properly worn, the wearer (designated O-056-B) can communicate with O-056-A and command them to perform simple tasks or attack perceived threats. All O-056-A will carry out commands with maximum effort. If no command is given, O-056-A will cluster around O-056-B to protect and guard the latter.All O-056-B refer to themselves as ""emissaries of the King of Beasts, guardian spirits of the hunters."" They claim their mission is to oppose and hunt ""the monstrosity of ████, the dark terror of the frozen depths—███-███."" If O-0██ is mentioned, O-056-B will state that ""they are spirits with a mission as well, though serving another great being,"" refusing to elaborate further.Summon Effect:Soul Summoner fights by your side in battle and grants you the ability to call forth a phantom firebird that deals massive damage to enemies.III. Combat Deviation: Zapamander O-057Deviation O-057 is an anomalous weather phenomenon. It causes severe convective weather, accompanied by heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and strong winds. Eventually, it coalesces into a massive storm cloud (hereafter O-057-A) with autonomous will and movement.Outwardly, O-057-A resembles a large, tailed animal with an irregular shape. Normally, its cloud base has a diameter of 6,000 meters and an altitude of 2,000 meters, though it can reach heights of up to 11,000 meters. The cloud appears dark gray and contains intense electrical discharges. O-057-A typically lasts for about 16 to 24 hours, during which it feeds on other clouds with higher concentration nuclei densities, exhibiting behavior akin to a predatory animal.O-057-A's primary Deviation Trait is energy manipulation. It can direct and control its lightning discharges and accompanying electromagnetic radiation, with electrical currents reaching several hundred thousand amperes. O-057-A is extremely timid and easily stressed, and will indiscriminately attack any moving targets nearby. Due to its large size and relatively low-altitude cloud base, it poses a significant threat to entities on the ground.In one securement breach, O-0██ was agitated by O-057-A's lightning and thunder, triggering an unprecedented spat...",1761134408,['enable_steam_china']

2139460,Upcoming Fixes and Adjustments to Visional Wheel S2: Lunar Revelry,"Dear Metas,Since the launch of Visional Wheel S2: Lunar Revelry, we've received a lot of feedback and realized that some aspects were suboptimal. We are currently working to fix the issues and optimize the gameplay experience. The fixed issues and planned adjustments are as follows:Issue 1: Defeated Deviants drop Lunar Whispers even when it's not a Blood Moon.This issue was fixed on the day of launch. Lunar Whispers will now only drop during a Blood Moon.Issue 2: In Prismverse's Clash (Visional), ore distribution is abnormal during a Blood Moon.This issue has been fixed.Issue 3: Lord of Moonlight is difficult to defeat as a solo player, and the rewards it drops aren't worth it.Following data analysis, we've adjusted the difficulty of Lord of Moonlight and added a loot crate drop. The latest reward rules are as follows:1. Lv. 40 and above Lord of Moonlight is guaranteed to drop S2 Mod Selection Crate - Stardust's Advent Ⅱ ×1.2. \ Lord of Moonlight of any level is guaranteed to drop S2 Mod Selection Crate - Stardust's Advent Ⅱ ×2.3. Electric Eel - Lunar Oracle, ZapCam - Lunar Oracle, and Atomic Snail - Lunar Oracle can only be obtained as a drop from Lord of Moonlight.Issue 4: The update announcement stated that, in the Endless Dream scenario, Lord of Moonlight would not be affected by Dream Zones. However, Lord of Moonlight is still too strong.In Endless Dream, the area levels are relatively high, which causes the Lord of Moonlight that spawns there to be much stronger. We've adjusted the basic stats of Lord of Moonlight across all levels for the Endless Dream scenario, reducing its difficulty.The visual bug incorrectly displaying ""Dream Zone"" buffs on the Lord of Moonlight has now been fixed. The Lord of Moonlight was never actually affected by these buffs, and the interface now correctly shows its unbuffed state.We apologize for any confusion caused. Thank you for your patience and support! Issue 5: After Lord of Moonlight attacks a player, the player's cosmetics or fashions become buggy.We are investigating this issue as a top priority and will fix it as soon as possible. More information will be provided in a future Bug Fixes announcement.Issue 6: Lord of Moonlight has infinite Adrenaline Shots.The Lord of Moonlight's AI reset logic error (occurring during high player activity) has been patched.Thank you for your feedback on this Visional Wheel. We'll keep improving its quality to provide a better experience.Once Human's first global co-op event ""Lunar Revelry: Omen of Affliction"" is now active as of September 28, 21:00 PM(PT).

Lightforge Loot Crate reruns now feature exclusive collection progress benefits! You can claim tiered rewards based on the number of Lightforge Collection items you've obtained.2. The Lightforge Loot Crate mechanics and probability rates are unchanged, and guarantee progress carries over:a) The original draw probability, redemption cost, and guarantee system of each Lightforge Loot Crate remain unchanged. For more information, refer to the specific Lightforge Loot Crate's rules.* For example, if the original loot crate guaranteed a Lightforge Collection item within 30 draws, the rerun version with the""choose 1 of 3"" mechanic will follow the same rule and also guarantee a Lightforge Collection item within 30 draws. Likewise, if the original crate guaranteed a Lightforge Gem within 20 draws, the rerun version will follow suit and guarantee a Lightforge Gem within 20 draws.b) If you've opened a theme before, its rerun will carry over your guarantee progress. For example, if you've drawn from a Lightforge Loot Crate theme 10 times, your guarantee will start counting from 10 out of the 30 draws needed. Please log in with the same character to inherit your guarantee progress.c) If you've already drawn all Lightforge Collection items from the selected Lightforge Loot Crate, you can claim its collection progress rewards from the rerun interface.3.

This choice is shared between all characters on your account and cannot be changed once confirmed.b) You can change your mind as long as you have not drawn or redeemed from the Lightforge Loot Crate them, or purchased its discounted Lightforge Ingots.c) Claiming collection progress rewards does not count as having opened the Lightforge Loot Crate.

This includes 468 players penalized for cheating, 127 accounts suspended for alt-account exploitation and linked violations, 53 players penalized for malicious interference.We are committed to providing the best possible gameplay experience and continuously improving our monitoring systems. Today, we would like to share the latest updates and optimization plans with all Metas.Because the AI model is still being updated, a small number of players who did not break the rules were mistakenly penalized. Monitoring data shows that actions like opening doors or getting stuck on stairs can sometimes trigger false bans. This issue will be fixed with the September 25 version update. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or objections about a penalty, please submit an appeal through the in-game appeal screen.To reduce violations and false penalties at the root, we will be launching a special initiative focused on fair operations.In the new version, we will improve detection for abnormal behaviors such as melee attacks, dragging other players, and teleportation. We will also refine the wall penetration detection system, fix false bans caused by character displacement during door operations or construction, and lower the chance of misjudging normal actions. If you discover new forms of violations, please report them through the reporting channel. We will keep improving our detection systems and patrol regularly to stop behaviors that disrupt fair gameplay.The game already includes features such as real-time ticker display of banned Metas and synchronization of character ban status with friends and search bar visibility. We invite all Metas to help us maintain a fair and healthy game environment and combat malicious actions. Thank you for your understanding and support!Below is a list of players recently penalized for severe violations. The accounts involved have been reviewed and confirmed to be in violation.

Improvements include upgraded smart filtering to reduce false positives and better manual review processes for more accurate judgment. We'll continue refining this system to make communication smoother.This world is brought to life by your interactions—whether you're sharing highlights or fighting alongside friends, every sincere exchange brings warmth to the game. We hope everyone uses kind words to build meaningful memories and protect the beauty of the world of Nalcott together.2.

Metas, are you ready?Here are the details for the new Visional Wheel:Visional Wheel: Lunar RevelryA crimson moon rises, enshrouding all realms in its light. A doom forever yet to come will descend once again. The Blood Moon will manipulate Nalcott for its amusement, provoking conflict among humans with tempting treasures. Only by defeating its avatar, the Lord of Moonlight, will you earn the ultimate reward.Duration:Starts after the September 24(PT) updateEnding time TBCAffected scenarios:Manibus (excluding novice), Evolution's Call, Prismverse's Clash, The Way of Winter, Endless DreamUpgraded Blood Moon GameplaySurvival EnvironmentEvery day from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM (30 minutes in real time, double that of S0: Lunar Oracle), as day turns to night, the Blood Moon will rise over Nalcott. During this time, Deviants will grow stronger, and Metas will be infected with Lunacy, diminishing their Sanity.Lord of MoonlightThe Lord of Moonlight is the avatar of the Blood Moon itself. Its appearance is ever-changing, and it is far more powerful than the Lunarspawn upon whom it bestows life and madness. It has descended upon Nalcott to instigate conflict for its own pleasure and entertainment.Rules:·      During a Blood Moon, you will be subject to the moon's gaze. When the gaze's intensity reaches a certain level, the Lord of Moonlight will take on your appearance and summon Lunarspawn to protect itself.·      On the verge of death, the Lord of Moonlight will use an Adrenaline Shot and summon clones to assist it in battle.·      In some cases, the Lord of Moonlight may even transform into a powerful Morphed Lord of Moonlight, which yields even better rewards when defeated.·      When the Lord of Moonlight defeats a Meta, it will level up and grow stronger, while also taking Metas’ Lunar Whispers. The Meta who defeats the Lord of Moonlight will acquire all the Lunar Whispers it has accumulated.·      In Endless Dream, the Lord of Moonlight is unaffected by Dream Zones, keeping its difficulty in line with other scenarios.Omen of Affliction EventTo pass the Blood Moon's trial, you must unite and work together to defeat the Lord of Moonlight and seize its treasure. Metas are organized into sectors to assist one another. Tonight, under the moon, let the show begin!*This image is a preview; the final effect is subject to the in-game display.Rules:·      The Blood Moon will divide Nalcott into sectors. Metas in each sector must band together to defeat the Lord of Moonlight. If you defeat the Lord of Moonlight within the event period, you will gain Lunar Essence, which you can submit to earn an equal number of sector points.·      To encourage participation and challenge their teamwork, there will be seven rounds of 1v1 trial matches between sectors. When submitting Lunar Essence, you can vote for a Lunar Omen to inflict the opposing sector. This will affect the abilities of their Lord of Moonlight. There are six Lunar Omens in total. The more Lunar Essence your sector submits, the stronger the omen's effects. The three Lunar Omens with the most votes will take effect in the opposing sector, creating different levels of difficulty.·      Each round of matches lasts one week. The sector that earns the most sector points during this time will earn 1 victory point. Unite to resist the Blood Moon and receive the ultimate glory!* As the Lord of Moonlight is a formidable opponent, sectors will be divided by time zone (region) to make it easier for you to challenge it together. You can check your sector on the event screen.Lunatic Medley EventCollect Lunar Whispers to unlock awesome rewards, including new weapon skins, and collectibles.

2139460,Optimizations to Permanent Server World Merges and Scenario Sign-up Cooldown,"Dear Metas,We're thrilled to see so many of you choosing to play on permanent servers. We've been closely monitoring your feedback, systematically investigating and addressing the issues you've raised. Frequently reported problems, such as new players being unable to obtain class fragments and the Scenario Challenge feature being absent, have been fixed in a recent update. In the September 11 update, we'll address the issues with World merges on permanent servers, as well as make optimizations to the sign-up rules.I. Final World merge on September 10, no World merges for permanent servers from September 11World merges for permanent servers were intended to maintain a stable server ecosystem. Since then, we've implemented multiple server optimizations and introduced voluntary migration to permanent servers, so World merges are no longer required to stabilize servers. Feedback has also shown that players on permanent servers tend to prefer long-term stability and a relatively consistent gameplay experience, goals which are undermined by World merges. Thus, after careful consideration, we've decided to implement the following changes:1. To maintain the performance of existing permanent servers and prevent critical issues, we will conduct one final World merge for servers with a high number of Worlds on September 10, followed by performance optimizations. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.2. After the September 11 update, Worlds in permanent servers will no longer be merged. Instead, you can voluntarily migrate to your preferred World.II. Added sign-up cooldowns for permanent servers and servers in their settlement phasePreviously, to ensure the freedom to explore various scenarios, we did not impose restrictions on signing up for permanent servers or servers in their settlement phase. However, this has not brought any meaningful benefits. Instead, it has made the system harder to understand and hindered the formation and stability of social ecosystems on permanent servers. Therefore, in the September 11 update, we plan to adjust the sign-up cooldown rules for permanent servers and servers in their settlement phase as follows:1. If a character signs up for and joins a permanent server or a server in its settlement phase, that character cannot join another permanent server or server in its settlement phase for 12 hours. This cooldown period will be increased incrementally each time the character signs up for and joins a permanent server or server in its settlement phase within a natural month.2. To ensure a smooth experience, the sign-up cooldown period will be reset every 1st day of the month.We will continue to update and optimize permanent servers in the future.

2139460,"Fair Play Announcement (July 30th, 2025 – August 25th, 2025)","Dear Metas, From July 30th to August 25th, Once Human banned a total of 781 Players. This includes 540 players penalized for cheating, 118 accounts suspended for alt-account exploitation and linked violations, 123 players penalized for malicious interference.Recently, we've received many questions concerning recent account bans for wall-clipping exploits in RaidZone mode. Hence, we wanted to take this chance to provide some clarification.Our backend data indicates that some players have been exploiting a flaw in our building models to perform wall-clipping actions, including passing through walls at certain corners or shooting through walls.Our anti-cheat system uses a combination of AI detection and human review. As our AI model is still being refined, a small number of innocent players were mistakenly penalized. For example, due to an edge case in the detection algorithm, some players were incorrectly penalized for using Shattered Maiden. This issue has been fixed in the August 28 update, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.If you have any questions or objections regarding your penalty, please contact us through the in-game appeal system.To tackle both cheating and false positives at their root, we're implementing dedicated fixes to our building and wall models. This includes optimizing their collision logic and patching known wall-clipping exploits. We're also upgrading our AI detection model to account for each player's gameplay history and habits. This holistic approach should reduce the chance of mistaken penalties.If you discover any new wall-clipping exploits or other rule violations, please report them to us through the Feedback Platform or our Customer Service channels. We'll also continue to monitor this issue and make improvements as required.Below is a list of players recently penalized for severe violations. The accounts involved have been reviewed and confirmed to be in violation. For any questions, please contact in-game customer support.1. Language violationsFrom July 30th to August 25th, 2025, a total of 2,681 players received bans of varying durations for language violations:30 days — 87 players7 days — 167 players1 day — 1,273 players2 hours — 644 players(Due to space limitations, we do not provide the list of players banned for speech violations.) We've been paying close attention to feedback regarding the chat restriction system and have launched a focused optimization effort. Improvements include upgraded smart filtering to reduce false positives and better manual review processes for more accurate judgment. We'll continue refining this system to make communication smoother.This world is brought to life by your interactions—whether you're sharing highlights or fighting alongside friends, every sincere exchange brings warmth to the game. We hope everyone uses kind words to build meaningful memories and protect the beauty of the world of Nalcott together. 2. Use of cheats or hacksWe will identify the characteristics of newly discovered cheats and use them for retroactive investigations.

2139460,Development Update | Update Preview: August Balance Adjustments,"Dear Metas,Every month, we implement new balance adjustments to improve Once Human's combat experience. In the August 28 update, our main focus is optimizing the Frost Vortex keyword effect. We'll also adjust the strength of some weapon blueprints, while buffing the Deviations: Polar Jelly and Lonewolf's Whisper.I. Frost Vortex Optimizations and Blueprint Effect AdjustmentsWe've noticed that the Frost Vortex keyword effect isn't performing as intended in some situations for the following reasons:1. It doesn't generate vortexes in optimal locations.2. The damage is delayed and has slow damage build-up, requiring multiple vortexes to deal maximum damage.To resolve these issues, we are optimizing the Frost Vortex keyword effect as follows:1. Optimize the locations where vortexes are generated so they're more likely to hit enemies or Deviants.2. Reduce the damage delay, shortening the interval between generation and dealing damage.3. Increase the damage of a single vortex. A single vortex will be able to deal more damage than three vortexes did previously. To compensate, we will slightly reduce the chance of triggering a vortex with Frost Vortex weapons. This change will enhance Frost Vortex's overall damage and damage build-up speed.We will also adjust Frost weapons and gear to improve the experience of using Frost builds.The changes are as follows: PreviousNowFrost Vortex - KeywordCreates a trap with a radius of 4.5 meters. Enemies inside the trap take 30% Psi Intensity as Status DMG every 1s for 4s. Up to 2 vortexes can exist simultaneously.Creates a trap with a radius of 4.5 meters. Enemies inside the trap take 50% Psi Intensity as Status DMG every 0.5s for 4s. Up to 1 vortex can exist simultaneously.Optimized the locations where Frost Vortexes can be generated.

Frost Vortex now deals damage instantly upon generation.Abyss GlanceTriggers Frost Vortex after 14 hits.Hitting a Weakspot counts as 2 hits.The closer to the Frost Vortex center, the higher the Frost Vortex DMG, up to +250%.Frost DMG +30%.Hitting enemies triggers Frost Vortex.

2139460,Once Human: RaidZone Update Preview,"Dear Meta,We've been paying close attention to your feedback since the launch of Once Human: RaidZone. The August 28 update will include optimizations to the anti-cheat system, vehicle mechanics, survival experience, and server rules. Below is a preview of the upcoming RaidZone content. We can't wait to share these improvements with you!I. Anti-Cheat OptimizationsMaintaining fair competition is one of our biggest priorities in Once Human: RaidZone. We have rigorously tackled cheating through continuous upgrades to our monitoring system, reverse-tracing of external cheats, and iterative improvements to our AI detection models. To further strengthen our anti-cheat efforts, we will introduce the following optimizations in the August 28 update:Increased Transparency on Sanctioned Accounts1. Banned players on your current server will be displayed in a marquee, ensuring cheaters have nowhere to hide.2. Character ban status will be displayed in the Friends list and search results, allowing you to identify sanctioned accounts more easily.Player Moderators3. To allow players to contribute to maintaining fairness, we will soon start recruiting player moderators through our community channels.As guardians of the Once Human experience, moderators will assist us in identifying and analyzing rule-breaking behavior.Successful applicants will receive an exclusive in-game Moderator Badge and earn rewards—including in-game items and limited merch—based on their contributions to game moderation.Recruitment details will be available in an upcoming dev update. We encourage all interested players to apply!We're also working on comprehensive upgrades to the in-game reporting system, including a streamlined reporting process, new violation categories, and improved progress tracking. These changes are scheduled for the September version update. Cheating not only undermines fair play but also negatively impacts the open-world experience for all players. We have a zero-tolerance policy against cheating and will continue to invest in our anti-cheat efforts. We also look forward to working with you to safeguard Nalcott through moderation and reporting.II. Vehicle OptimizationsTo allow you to traverse the wilderness more freely and smoothly, this update will introduce the following optimizations to the vehicle mechanics:1. Bicycles that spawn on the map will have full Durability by default and can be used straight away without repairs.2. Increased the maximum Durability of bicycles to make them last longer and more resistant to destruction.3. You can no longer carry a pillion rider on bicycles.4. Vehicles can now destroy most barriers in the open world by colliding with them, reducing situations where you're stuck on obstacles during exploration.III. Survival OptimizationsTo give you more freedom of exploration while preserving its challenge, this update will introduce the following optimizations to the survival mechanics:1. DurabilityReduced the Stamina cost of sprinting by 25%.Removed the Stamina cost of gathering.Increased the Stamina recovery speed by 25%.Developer Message: We want Stamina management to be mainly focused on rolling, gliding, and other actions relevant to combat or escaping, rather than regular exploration and gathering.2. Hydration and Energy EffectsNegative Effects: Previously, Load would gradually decrease when Energy was below 30%. Now, Load will only be reduced when Energy reaches 0. Previously, Stamina recovery speed and Movement Speed would be reduced when Hydration was below 30%. Now, only Movement Speed will be reduced when Hydration reaches 0.Positive Effects: Previously, the Stamina cost of sprinting was reduced when Hydration reached 60%. Now, this will only apply when Hydration reaches 100%. Likewise, a Force recovery effect will only apply when Energy reaches 100%.Developer Message: These changes aim to reduce the basic survival pressure, so you don't have to constantly monitor your Energy and Hydration to avoid penalties. At the same time, we want to offer bigger incentives for maintaining full Energy and Hydration to reward careful management of these parameters.3. Returning from BlackoutPreviously, after returning from a blackout, Energy and Hydration would be restored to their pre-blackout levels, which imposed a heavy burden on players with limited supplies. Now, Energy will be restored to approximately 50% and Hydration to approximately 70% after a blackout.4. SanityIn RaidZone scenarios, all Sanity-related negative effects will be temporarily disabled, and players' Max HP will remain fixed.IV. Phase Progression and Ending AdjustmentsTo deliver a more consistent experience, this update will optimize RaidZone's phase and ending rules as follows:1. RaidZone servers opened after the August 28 update will have Scenario Challenges unlocked by default and consist of a single phase rather than multiple phases.2. RaidZone servers opened after the August 28 update will no longer have triggerable endings or...",1755859053,['enable_steam_china']

If a character signs up for and joins a permanent server or a server in its settlement phase, that character cannot join another permanent server or server in its settlement phase for 3 days.We understand that you may sometimes join the wrong server by accident, so the cooldown will only trigger after a character signs up for a permanent server or a server in its settlement phase for the third time.Once Human Development Team ",1755856429,['enable_steam_china']

2139460,Once Human Server Launch Rules and Schedule Announcement,"Dear Meta,To foster a better server ecosystem and continuously enhance the gameplay experience for Meta-Humans within scenarios, we will be adjusting the server launch schedule. The updated rules are as follows:Ⅰ. Scenario Start Rule Adjustments1. After the version maintenance update on August 13, server launches will primarily focus on scenario servers with the ""Visional"" tag, including: Endless Dream, Manibus, The Way of Winter, Prismverse's Clash, and Evolution's Call.2. Scenario servers without the ""Visional"" tag will move to a monthly launch schedule, starting once on the 1st day of each month. This will officially begin on September 1, covering: Endless Dream, Manibus, The Way of Winter, Prismverse's Clash, and Evolution's Call.3. To create a better server ecosystem and improve in-scenario gameplay, the Southeast Asia, South America, and Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan regions will temporarily suspend the Evolution's Call scenario. Other regions will no longer launch Evolution's Call or Prismverse's Clash without the ""Visional"" tag.Ⅱ. Scenario Start Timing AdjustedWe have received a large amount of feedback from Meta-Humans requesting a clearer and more consistent server launch schedule.Therefore, after the version maintenance update on August 14, all server launches will be standardized to 8:00 AM in each respective region and will follow fixed weekly intervals.

The number represents your current network ping. If it turns red, it means the server is overloaded.1. Q: When does server overload occur?A: Server overload often occurs when many players gather in the same area and engage in intense combat. The sudden spike in traffic exceeds the server's normal capacity, causing server overload.2. Q: What happens when the server is overloaded?A: You may experience lag while moving. Skill effects or damage calculations may also be delayed.3. Q: What do I do when the server is overloaded?A: To maintain a stable connection, avoid staying in areas with high player concentrations for extended periods. You can switch to a less crowded World or move to a different zone. If you encounter a server overload warning during an event, try reducing your attack frequency to minimize potential skill effect delays or damage lag.The server will dynamically allocate resources to accommodate the combat situation. Data processing speed will slowly recover, allowing players to resume normal gameplay, and the server overload prompt will disappear. We will continue to optimize server performance to minimize this issue. Thank you for...",1752665306,['enable_steam_china']

We will gradually optimize the combat experience and stat balance of the class system in future updates.To ensure a smooth transition, we will issue Blueprint Conversion Attempt ×3 to all players after this update. Vehicles1) To align vehicle acquisition with the core survival and exploration gameplay, we have added vehicle scrapyards to the wilderness in all scenarios. After unlocking the Vehicle Garage in Memetics, you can craft Vehicle Repair Electric Drills at the Supplies Workbench and use them to repair and drive these vehicles. In non-RaidZone scenarios, vehicles with zero Durability no longer need to be returned to the Garage for repairs. Instead, they can still be summoned and repaired on the spot with Vehicle Repair Electric Drills. Once you've driven a vehicle back to your territory, you can lock it for 5 Copper Ingots and 2 Metal Scraps either by interacting with the vehicle or through your Garage....",1752652456,['enable_steam_china']

2139460,Once Human: RaidZone Update Preview,"Since the launch of Once Human: RaidZone, we have been closely monitoring the PvP combat and balance in this mode.Following a period of observation and analysis, we plan to address several game balance issues. In this post, we will share our preliminary plans so you can provide feedback.Territory OptimizationsAttacking and defending territories is a core gameplay element in Once Human: RaidZone. Currently, some construction features may provide unfair intel advantages, affecting the mode's fairness. Hence, we plan to disable or limit certain features, such as using flight mode in Construction mode, in RaidZone only.We want to ensure that all players, whether attacking or defending, can compete on an equal footing, where victory is decided by skill, effort, and strategy rather than exploiting shortcuts. Manibus Summon AdjustmentsThe Manibus summon mechanic is a key feature designed to increase excitement and add variation to Once Human: RaidZone. However, its current implementation does not fully align with our aims.Notably, its excessive damage and server impact have disrupted Once Human: RaidZone's intended pace.To make this mechanic more manageable, we're planning adjustments to the following key areas:1) Increase the tech requirements and resource costs of crafting Evolution Control Units and Manibus's Beacons.2) Reduce the range of Manibus strikes and limit the damage they deal to structures, making them less destructive than before.3) Remove the post-strike area effects that continuously drain Sanity and spawn additional Realm Fragments.4) Reduce the impact of Manibus strikes on the server's realm destruction progress.In the future, we will implement more comprehensive adjustments to the Manibus summon mechanic. We aim to refine it into a core aspect of the attackers vs. defenders gameplay. Stay tuned! Friendly FireCurrently in Once Human: RaidZone, having a simple numerical superiority has a disproportionate impact on team battle outcomes, significantly affecting game balance.To place more emphasis on team coordination and strategy, we will introduce a friendly fire mechanic. This means weapons, Deviation skills, and other attacks will damage allied units and structures.We will continue to monitor this feature and gather player feedback to decide if further adjustments are necessary. Weapon Accessories Changed to ItemsCurrently in Once Human: RaidZone, players who wish to strengthen their weapons must spend large amounts of time and resources to unlock accessories via the Memetics system. This approach has clear limitations, not only putting pressure on the player but also restricting their strategic options.To deliver a richer and freer gameplay experience, we will convert weapon accessories into item form. The actual changes are as follows.We will change weapon accessories into individual equipment items.1) Each accessory can only be equipped to one weapon.2) Equipped accessories can be unequipped and returned to the Tool Backpack.3) Accessories can be obtained through crafting, exploration, PvP loot, and other methods.4) Equipped accessories stay on their weapons. Weapons that are transferred through Gear Crates or dropped will retain their equipped accessories.These changes will diversify players' strategic options in the game. You no longer need to unlock Memetics to strengthen their weapons. As long as you have enough accessory items, you can maintain high stats on weapons in your Supply Box. If you find an accessory while exploring, you can use it to instantly strengthen your current weapon without spending additional resources to unlock Memetics. Additionally, the appearance of rare accessories will greatly improve a weapon's value, making them a high priority during PvP encounters. Anti-Cheat MeasuresFair competition is the core principle of Once Human: RaidZone. We do not tolerate the use of cheats, exploits, or other malicious acts that undermine fair play and the player experience. Combating cheaters is one of our top priorities, and we have implemented a series of forceful countermeasures to this end. We are constantly upgrading our anti-cheat monitoring system. We reverse-engineer third-party cheat programs to learn more about their development and operation, allowing us to better detect and prevent them. Simultaneously, we continue to refine our detection models, using cutting-edge AI and Big Data technologies to analyze and compare player behavior in real time. To date, we have implemented over 100 optimizations to our detection models, and fixed exploitable loopholes involving teleportation, flight, speed-ups, and more. We are also aware of players using ""cheat carrying""—knowingly playing with cheaters—to gain unfair advantages. This behavior not only affects the game's balance, but also harms other players, causing frustration to those seeking fair competition. We will show zero tolerance to players who break the rules and impose strict penalties based on the severity of their offens...",1752550035,['enable_steam_china']

Specific details are as follows:Crops: Only produce directly harvested by Meta-Humans in Eternaland (such as mature crops) can be taken out. Special yields obtained through Deviations are not currently eligible for transfer.Livestock: Byproducts and secondary products from raised animals (such as meat and hides) can be taken out. The animals themselves cannot.We have already begun optimizing these rules. Any future changes will be announced in a timely manner. Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
