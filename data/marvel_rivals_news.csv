Complete missions to earn a FREE costume: Spider-Man - Iron Spider! CompetitiveTo ease competitive pressure, we've adjusted ranked rewards:1. Gold-tier rewards remain the same; one costume per half-season. Season 5.0 Gold-tier costume reward is Gambit - Sacrificial Pawn.2. Crests of Honor (inc. Top 500) and Nameplate Frame rewards are now granted once per season at the season's end.Competitive Team Limit Adjustments:1. Bronze to Grandmaster: Team up with any party size except five-stack.2. Celestial/Eternity/One Above All: Only solo or duo queue allowed. Placement MatchesFrom Season 5 onward, your first 10 ranked matches are Placement Matches. Your performance determines your starting tier.Placement Rules 1.1 Predicted vs. Actual Rank• During placement matches, you will receive a predicted rank reflecting your estimated skill level. This predicted rank is used for matchmaking and team formation during placement matches.• Predicted rank is not your final rank. After completing all 10 placement matches, you will be assigned your actual rank, which may differ from your predicted rank. • If you don't finish all placement matches this season, you will not receive any season rewards.• If you complete placement matches in the first half of the season, you'll keep that rank in the second half. If you don't finish placements in the first half, you must complete them in the second half to be eligible for ranked rewards. Reward Rules:• To earn the Gold tier costume reward for a half-season, you must complete 10 ranked matches in that season's half and finish at Gold rank or higher at the end of the half-season.• To receive season-end rewards, you must complete placement matches and meet the required rank at season's end. Example:If you finish 9 placement matches in the first half of the season with an estimated rank of Platinum III, but don't complete the 10th match, you won't get the Gold costume reward. If you complete your 10th placement match in the second half of the season, you'll be eligible for season-end rewards but not both halves' Gold costumes.If you play 10 ranked matches in both halves of the season, you'll be eligible for both Gold costumes and the season-end rewards.Additionally, if you don't finish 10 placement matches in Season 5, your Season 6 initial estimated rank for placement matches will be Platinum III. 1.2 First-Time PlacementWhen doing placements for the first time (regardless of season), your initial estimated rank is determined by two criteria:• Initial Estimated Rank A: If you played 10 or more ranked matches in Season 4, your Season 5 placement matches estimated starting rank is your Season 4 final rank minus 3 divisions. Please note that players ranked in the Celestial II, Celestial I, Eternity, and One Above All in Season 4 will be uniformly reset to Grandmaster II as their initial estimated rank for the new season. Players in Bronze III, Bronze II, Bronze I, and Silver III will start at Bronze III as their initial estimated rank. • Initial Estimated Rank B: We'll also check your highest historical rank from any previous season with 10+ matches, subtract some sub-tiers, and set this as your historical initial rank for placement matches (capped at Platinum II). Your higher result from A or B becomes your initial predicted rank.Example: If A gives Gold I and B gives Platinum III, you start placement matches at Platinum III.If you do not complete 10 placement matches in Season 5, the same rules will apply the next time you do placements. 1.3 Subsequent Placemen...",1763010309,

Now, after a quick snooze (and a smack), everyone's back in the action, just like Star-Lord after his morning coffee. 3.Emma Frost's Diamond Dilemma: Sometimes, when Emma switched to her diamond form, textures from her own perspective would glitch out. She's now flawless, both inside and out! 4.Mister Fantastic's Portal Puzzler: When Reed tried to stretch his way after a target through a Doctor Strange portal with Flexible Elongation, he'd sometimes veer off in the wrong direction and would go through at all!
