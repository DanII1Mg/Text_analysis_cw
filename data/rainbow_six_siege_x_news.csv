359550,Rainbow Six Siege Devs Reflect on 10 Years and the Game’s Future,"When <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em> launched ten years ago, I am not sure many people expected it to outlive many of the games released that same year. However, here we are, and the game is still going strong with a massive install base, an esports scene, and—judging by the looks of things—Ubisoft has no plans to slow down. <em><a href=""https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/rainbow-six-seiege-xbox-one-review/"">Rainbow Six Siege</a></em> has managed to evolve with the times, and with a team of almost 1,000 people working across Ubisoft, it is a force to be reckoned with. On a recent visit to <a href=""https://www.cgmagonline.com/interviews/ubisoft-animation-watch-dogs/"">Ubisoft Montreal</a>, I had the chance to chat with <em>Siege</em> creative director <a href=""https://x.com/karpazis?lang=en"">Alexander Karpazis</a> and <em>Siege</em> game director <a href=""https://x.com/iSmallville"">Joshua Mills</a> about the game and where <em>Siege</em> is heading in the future. <a href=""https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/wildcards-siege-mode-10th-anniversery/"">Beyond the limited-time Wildcards <em>Siege</em> mode</a> that launched on Dec. 15, it sounds like the team behind the game is constantly looking ahead at what they can do next.

Now marking its 10-year anniversary, a milestone few online games reach, Ubisoft is introducing something special. From Dec. 15 to Jan. 5, the game will feature a new limited-time mode called Wildcards Siege. <em>Wildcards Siege</em> places players in a 5v5 bomb match on the reworked House map. This time, however, gameplay comes with a twist. At the start of each round, players vote on modifier cards that can drastically change how the match plays out. The two cards with the most votes are activated, altering the rules in unique and potentially fun ways.

359550,R6 SHIELDGUARD - Y10S3 UPDATE,"The R6 ShieldGuard team is here to highlight the progress made this season, with some news on what's to come.STATUS OVERVIEWCompetitive integrity is the foundation of Siege, and we've continued to listen to your concerns, and monitor your feedback. It's clear however, that cheating remains to be a core issue. We're committed to the betterment of Siege for all players, and although we have seen recent, minor improvements, it's important to note that this is part of a larger journey and vision.Firstly, we can confirm that we'll be doubling the cadence of R6 ShieldGuard updates in Season 4. Secondly, to help us develop the necessary improvements more quickly, we're working to share technology with partners across the industry. The R6 ShieldGuard team is also continuing to expand to accelerate future updates.PLAN OF ACTIONMORE UPDATES IN SEASON 4For multiple seasons now, we've been deploying R6 ShieldGuard updates with each patch and hotfix, but in Season 4 this will be changing. Starting next season, we'll be doubling how often these R6 ShieldGuard updates are pushed to the game, disrupting cheat makers more than ever before.TARGETING HIGH PROFILE CHEATSOur team has targeted high profile cheat makers, and we are seeing results with these efforts. After recent updates were made, R6 ShieldGuard perma banned 1500 cheaters using high profile cheats, with an additional 2000 cheaters being perma banned while using a single notorious cheat product.DISABLING CHEATS FOR LONGERThis season, we've been working to increase the impact we're having on cheat makers, keeping them offline for longer, and we've started to have more success in this area. This has resulted in us keeping select cheats offline for up to 5-7 days, up from 1 or 2 days previously. Our target is to carry this momentum forward, while we work to address the cheats that are disrupting legitimate players.ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL CHEAT TYPESELO TRAPPINGELO trapping is the act of intentionally matchmaking against known opponents who deliberately throw games to secure unfair wins and boost another account's ranking. A ban wave targeting ELO trappers was completed in October, with over 4300 cheaters being perma banned (including 36% of the top 100 console players). We will continuously ban any accounts related to ELO trapping.BOTTINGThis season we've seen bots infiltrating our less competitive game modes, mainly Team Deathmatch. We've perma banned over 6000 bots this season, and any accounts with suspicious botting activity will continue to be perma banned.ANTI-RECOIL DETECTIONWe've talked about our anti-recoil detection efforts before, and we want to confirm that it continues to be developed as part of R6 ShieldGuard. This is a complex, machine learning system which needs to train using high volumes of data. The system is currently in its data gathering phase behind the scenes, with further development and testing stages to follow.PERMA-BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 SHIELDGUARDHere are our updated perma ban figures covering the last 12 months, with new data for August, September and October. The total monthly perma bans issued has continued to increase from February, with ban waves being completed across multiple cheat types.HOW YOU CAN HELPACTIVATE TWO FACTOR ATHENTICATIONKeeping your account secure helps keep the game fair for everyone. That's why we strongly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), especially using a mobile authenticator app if possible. By turning on 2FA, you're not just protecting your progress, you're helping us to fight cheating and keep the community safe. For more information on 2FA, check our self-help article.REPORTINGIn-game reporting continues to be the best way to get your reports to us, helping us to identify potential cheaters and take action.Your in-game reports help by:Feeding our automated systems while combining with additional information.Aiding the manual review process allowing cross reference for specific actions.Providing an understanding of player perception on the current state of cheating at a global scale.FINAL NOTEProtecting players is our number one priority. We've seen minor but noticeable improvements over recent weeks with our updates to R6 ShieldGuard, and we're working to continue on this trajectory. We'll have more to share in the Season 4 reveal panel, with changes that will aim to strengthen our protections and the day-to-day experience for everyone.Competitive integrity is the foundation of Siege, and we will keep fighting with every patch and update to protect it.YEAR 10 SEASON 4 - REVEAL PANELA new season of Siege is almost here!

359550,Y10S3.3 PATCH NOTES,"See the upcoming changes with the release of Y10S3.3.BALANCINGJÄGERWe are boosting Jäger's secondary options by including a handgun with sights. This change should add versatility to the loadout and a more reliable mid-range secondary for players that want to use the M870 as primary weapon.LOADOUTSecondary weapons: Added the P-10CBANDITHitting exterior soft walls before reinforcing is a common tactic used to improve sound propagation, allowing defenders inside the objective to better anticipate enemy movements outside. Bandit has traditionally lacked a reliable secondary weapon to perform this kind of setup independently. With the introduction of the Keratos .357, Bandit gains the ability to create his own openings on exterior walls, enhancing his self-sufficiency during the preparation phase and reducing reliance on teammates for early-round destruction.LOADOUTSecondary weapons:Added Keratos .357SOLISSolis' use of her ability has not improved after the latest changes, players don't get enough benefit from it and we want to deal with this. We are reviewing her ability configuration and buffing a few parameters. The range of her ability will be increased along with its Overclock duration. We are also bringing the Impact Grenades back into her loadout to make her a more versatile roamer. SPEC-IODetection Range set to 20m (was 12m).Overclock Duration set to 15s (was 10s).Minimum SPEC-IO charge to activate the ability se to 25% (was 50%).LOADOUTGadgets: Added Impact Grenades and Removed Bullet Proof Camera.DENARIAfter statistical analysis and player feedback on Denari, we've decided to revert some of the changes from previous patches. We can admit they may have been done too hastily, so we have reverted the damage change and reconnection delay. In addition, the Glaive-12 has not performed the way we expected, and it is receiving a package of buffs to make the weapon more viable in gunfights.We've also taken in and understand feedback about its ability to create rotation holes feeling tedious. While slug shotguns can be used for rotation holes, the Glaive-12 primarily compliments Denari's T.R.I.P. connectors for precise lines of sight, foot holes and head holes.T.R.I.P. CONNECTORT.R.I.P. connector laser deals 20 damage.T.R.I.P. connectors reconnect instantly after having their line of sight blocked.GLAIVE-12Damage increased to 67 (was 63).Damage range drop-off increased up to 15 meters to match other slug shotguns.Improved recoil and first shot recoil (PC and Console).Total ammunition increased to 44 (was 29).Hip fire accuracy increased to match other slug shotguns.BUG FIXESOPERATORSFIXED - Alibi's Prisma prevents the formation of Denari's T.R.I.P.

359550,An Update to the Siege Community,"We've been reading your feedback and recognize there are important subjects we need to address. We acknowledge that we haven't communicated clearly enough about what we've been working on since the launch of Siege X, and we understand the frustration that's caused. We're committed to improving transparency and taking meaningful action on the issues you've raised. Based on your feedback, our upcoming priorities include anti-cheat, balancing, and ranked improvements. You can read about the current status of each below, with more updates coming on the road to Munich Major in November. We want to thank you all for your continued support while we work through these challenges, it means a lot.- Alex Karpazis and Joshua Mills, on behalf of the Siege teamANTI-CHEAT STATUS:Our systems in Siege X did not keep pace with the surge of cheaters that followed the move to Free Access, though we have made some progress. This is a difficult topic to address without tipping off cheat makers to our next move, so without saying too much here are a few key areas the team is working to improve, backed by additional resources.NEXT STEPS:Target high profile cheat makers and the use of a single notorious cheat product through advancements in Cheat Detection.Disrupt marketplace exploits.Issue permanent bans to players caught using these exploits.BALANCINGSTATUS:We've heard that updates can feel like all nerfs, no buffs, so we're changing up our approach when unexpected metas form and will prioritize a fun experience. We have high ambitions for larger system changes for the game's balancing, which will go into testing soon.NEXT STEPS:In patch 3.3 (coming Oct 14) we'll be reverting Denari's nerf. We reacted a little too quickly on tuning him based on what we saw on the test server. Additionally, Denari's Glaive-12 will be buffed. Solis will be receiving her impact grenades back to make her more fun to play. We can still see her influence in matches and how players use her shotgun for those post-plant situations.For Y10S4, we can confirm that Thermite, Hibana and Maverick will all be receiving buffs. Ace will have a lot more competition! Y10S4 will also introduce the Testing Grounds, a place to help us gather initial feedback and test implementation of gameplay features before they're integrated. An Armor and Speed system change for operators will be our first Testing Grounds subject. RANKEDSTATUS:Ranked 2.0 hasn't hit the mark yet and we're working on major changes. There will be matchmaking updates to start in Season 4 with more meaningful updates on the way.NEXT STEPS:With Y10S4, matchmaking will get more specific with Rank and squad size factored in.We are actively developing what we call Ranked Overhaul, with the objective of offering visible Ranked Reward Progression, as well as a visible Skill Progression.Player consultations are in progress with this new system, and we'll be running workshops during the Munich Major to further refine the design.We aim to have the Ranked Overhaul live in the first half of year 11. FINAL THOUGHTSWith much of this year's focus on setting a new foundation for updates to come, recent seasonal content has understandably felt lighter, especially for veteran players. We are looking at adjusting our seasonal approach to bring more substance to mid-season updates and we will share more on this topic during the November Munich Major.This update isn't exhaustive, but expect to hear more from us, and please continue sharing your reports, feedback, survey responses and gameplay. Your passion and commitment keep Siege growing. Your priorities are our priorities, and together we'll keep building Siege into the best it can be.   We look forward to celebrating our tenth anniversary together!{-}7 The Siege Team",1759948406,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_873083815_1759948871_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

359550,R6 SHIELDGUARD & ANTI-TOXICITY – Y10S2 UPDATE,"In our latest R6 ShieldGuard and Anti-Toxicity update, our teams will unveil key insights into Y10S2, along with actionable plans for both the current season and what's ahead.IN THIS UPDATER6 SHIELDGUARDStatus OverviewExploitsR6 ShieldGuard SecurityLive Security UpdatesAccount Related BansANTI-TOXICITYStanding Distribution UpdateReputation System SanctionsText and Voice Chat ModerationAbandonment PenaltiesPrivacy SettingsThe R6 ShieldGuard team is here to give an update on Anti-Cheat in Siege X. Today we'll look at the status since the release of Siege X and R6 ShieldGuard, and cover what's coming in the future. Check out the team's plans below.STATUS OVERVIEWSince the launch of Siege X, it's clear that there has been a surge in cheater reports. The share of matches featuring players who receive 4 or more cheater reports within that single game has risen from an average of 1.8% to 2.5%. This spike is tied to the evolution of in-game exploits and the ongoing development of cheat programs. We know the impact that this has had on the enjoyment of the game for many and we are very actively working on solutions.We've deployed several fixes since launch, though some of the improvements needed to strengthen R6 ShieldGuard will require longer-term development. Our goal is to make meaningful progress throughout Season 3 and beyond, ensuring we protect the game's integrity and improve your overall experience.EXPLOITSWith the release of Siege X and the increased number of players, bugs were found in the game that could be used to gain an unfair advantage over other teams and players. These exploits are also a form of cheating.With the help of our community, we've been able to address several major exploits as part of our most recent patches, including multiple teleportation glitches, legitimate external overlay applications providing an unfair visual advantage, impossible defusing spots or impossible use of weapons and gadgets, and crashes caused by specific operators. We have also identified and are actively fixing additional issues, with updates rolling out as soon as they're ready.We want to sincerely thank everyone who has contributed - content creators, players, and those who have submitted reports via R6Fix. Your input has been crucial in helping us reproduce and resolve many of these exploits. To further prevent new exploits, we're working on a global solution that includes stricter tolerances in given situations to prevent similar exploits. We continue to monitor the situation closely.R6 SHIELDGUARD SECURITYThroughout Operation Daybreak, we have deployed several updates to our underlying in-house obfuscation technology which hides and protects game code. These updates are strengthening our defenses, and while we're already seeing some positive trends, more updates will be coming with every patch and hotfix. We're also constantly investing in reducing and stopping new gameplay violations, while improving our detections, targeting specific cheat features and providers.LIVE SECURITY UPDATESYou may have noticed that Siege X occasionally requires a game restart and update. This is part of a new prevention system which has strengthened our anti-cheat defenses overall. While the system has been effective, we've identified bugs that have caused some players to be disconnected from matches or unable to reconnect. We understand how frustrating this can be and sincerely apologize for the disruption. Our team is actively working to resolve these issues so that players can benefit from enhanced protection without any unintended side effects.ACCOUNT RELATED BANSWe're actively developing new tools that detect accounts linked to previously banned cheaters. If a banned player attempts to return, they're flagged and removed as soon as suspicious behavior is detected. In addition, we're working on systems to hold players accountable if they knowingly squad up with cheaters. This is part of our broader effort to protect the integrity of the game at every level.PERMA-BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 SHIELDGUARDCheck out the last 12 months of perma-ban data, including new data for April to July. We can see here that the number of monthly bans has remained steady since the launch of Operation Prep Phase, with over 11,000 permanent bans issued on average per month. With a rise in cheaters being felt during the month of July however, investigation were started into whether our systems were still banning with the same effectiveness as previous months. This investigation led to adjustments being made to R6 ShieldGuard, which resulted in an additional ban wave being completed in early August. HOW YOU CAN HELPACTIVATE TWO FACTOR ATHENTICATIONKeeping your account secure helps keep the game fair for everyone. That's why we strongly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), especially using a mobile authenticator app if possible.

359550,R6 Shieldguard & Anit-Toxicity – Y10S1 UPDATE,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/491667e8b9afd37db62edf90e8ed24f639e5fc1a.png Today our R6 Shieldguard and Anti-Toxicity teams will be sharing their latest updates. We’ll have a deep dive on features and results from Y10S1, as well as a look at some of the updates coming to the game in the future. IN THIS UPDATE R6 ShieldGuard ANTI-TOXICITY Standing Distribution Impacts – Negative Actions Decreasing Tuning & Additional Repercussions Automated Textchat Moderation {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/c178ba4683802838adca5cc6d1c485db9843403a.png STATUS OVERVIEW Cheater reports have seen a downward trend throughout Y9S3, and this continued right up to the release of Y10S1.1. Since the Y10S1.1 update, we have seen an increase in cheater reports on PC. Thanks to your in-game cheater reports, our team has identified a correlation to some of our recent security updates. Below we’ll dive into those updates and the action we’re taking to turn this latest development around. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/9b885696b3b3f6df3351231a394aa10d8f45b6de.png MAKING OUR CODE STRONGER – NEW TECHNOLOGY In Y10S1 and in partnership with the security teams of Ubisoft, we introduced a hardening technology which enables new ways to secure our game code, making it more robust against cheat makers. This new technology now serves as a foundation for many other security improvements that will ship throughout the year. WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING The in-game impact of this technology was positive initially, though following Y10S1.1, we recorded an increase in cheater reports. We’ve seen that there is room for improvement, however this has only bolstered our commitment, and so we’ve worked to push new features throughout Y10S1, making the system more secure. Additionally, we’ve kept to our commitment to push security updates alongside patches, and so security hotfixes will continue leading up to and after the release of Siege X. Two additional security hotfixes are scheduled for deployment in May to further reinforce this approach. FIGHTING LAG ABUSE TO PROTECT FAIR PLAY In Y10S1, and with the help of the community, we fixed several exploits that were abusing network lag. We want to take the opportunity to heartfully thank the community, from content creators to everyone who submitted R6Fix reports. You have all helped us to both reproduce and fix many of these exploits that were possible on console. We’re continuing to monitor the situation and to help prevent lag exploits on a wider basis, we are currently working on a global solution, using stricter network tolerations (More info to come soon). PREVENTING MnK ON CONSOLE Previously we shared that console cheater reports increased after the launch of Crossplay, and that we fixed an exploit that would allow spoofers to by-pass detection. We can now confirm that reports have seen a drop of approximately 20%. However, Console cheater reports are still higher than pre-crossplay numbers and we are aware of anti-recoil cheats disrupting the community. Although our data shows that MouseTrap is performing well, catching spoofing devices such as Xim and Cronus, it currently lacks anti-recoil detection capabilities. We want to be clear, anti-recoil cheats are not acceptable, irrespective of platform. Although we cannot communicate on our roadmap at this time, rest assured that this is one of the R6 Shieldguard team’s top priorities, and we are actively researching solutions. In the meantime, please continue to submit in-game reports. SIEGE X & FUTURE PLANS SECURITY UPDATES WITH EACH PATCH We will keep making our code stronger with Siege X and beyond. A security update will go live at launch, with more updates rolling out season after season specifically targeting the ability for cheats to stay online and disrupt the game. R6 SHIELDGUARD UPDATES LIVE, NO MAINTENANCE REQUIRED A major update to R6 Shieldguard will allow us to distribute new executables with updated security measures to players without the need for scheduled maintenance. Periodically, a security update will be downloaded, and players will be asked to reboot their game. Note that this will never happen during a match. After a reboot, players can continue playing, knowing that they are now on a newer executable with new security measures. This will make cheats more difficult to make and more costly to maintain, forcing cheats to stay offline longer. SANCTIONS Thanks to the new gameplay violations introduced in Y10S1, combined with automated data analysis and investigations from our team, we continued the momentum from the start of the year by issuing strong permanent ban waves in March, resulting in over 6,500 R6 Shieldguard perma-bans that month alone. On average since the beginning of the year, R6 Shieldguard has issued about 2 times more permanent bans than last year, a clear testament to the performance and evolution of our systems.

This bundle has been designed in collaboration with artist Glambertiluvu and will be available for purchase in the in-game store for a limited time, starting May 8. With this program, we want to celebrate our amazingly creative and dedicated community artists and give them the chance to have their art styles represented in-game. Each chosen artist will have the opportunity to design a full set for an operator of their choice and the resulting bundles will become available for limited time during Year 9 and beyond. Glambertiluvu’s Iana Operator Bundle includes: Uniform Headgear ARX200 weapon skin Charm Don’t forget to have a look at our previous bundles if you haven’t yet: SAU_SIEGE, Sunstark, FrAgMenT, Pericote, Shinosaaaaaaang, Siege Tales, Retrodisaster, LevaSoj, and Notamutemain. ABOUT THE ARTIST Glambertiluvu’s – also known as RuL – interest for art started during her childhood as her parents were buying her art books and supplies. This led RuL to create doodles at a very young age, and even to draw on top of the illustrations in her school textbooks when growing up. Due to her obsession with visual arts and painting, she chose graphic design as her university major. In 2021, RuL transitioned from semi-realism to a 2D cartoon art style using flat colors. This style is reflected in her bundle for Iana: from the design of the charm to the color palette used throughout the operator and weapon skin. Impressed by Iana’s background and obsession for aerospace engineering, she chose to add different references to those in her bundle. Noticeably, the “space buns” hairstyle which is derived from the space-themed pop culture. Other starry details such as hair clips and face paint are found on Iana’s skin. The most astute eyes will notice the graffiti on Iana’s chest armor – “Meijer”, her real last name. Originally playing single-player games such as Assassin’s Creed Black Flag, Glambertiluvu was drawn into Siege thanks to Lion’s voice actor, Shawn Baichoo, who also interpreted Machiavelli in Assassin’s Creed II and Wrench in Watch Dogs 2. She described being chosen to collaborate with the Rainbow Six Siege team on designing this bundle as the highlight of her career, bringing her joy and pride. As a final word, we would like to quote RuL: “I would like to express my gratitude to the R6S community for their passion. Creating this concept art was a labor of love, and I hope it resonates with players as much as it does with me. The community's engagement and enthusiasm inspire me to continue pushing creative boundaries, and I look forward to contributing more in the future.” To see more of Glambertiluvu’s work, go check her Twitter and Instagram accounts. FAQ What is the Community Artist Bundle Program? The Community Artist Bundle Program launched in Y6S1 and it brings operator bundles created by some of our most talented and dedicated Siege fan artists into the game. I’m a Siege fan artist too – what can I do to get selected as well? Given the length of our production cycle for in-game content, the fan artists for Year 10 have already been determined. However, we are always on the lookout for future participants. If your goal is to see your bundle in-game, continue showing us your passion and strive to be an outstanding member of the Siege community. How can I get the Y10S2 Glambertiluvu Operator bundle? The bundle will be available in the in-game store for a limited time, starting May 8, and will remain live until the end of Y10S3. Players can purchase the bundle with R6 credits. Will this offer be available on all platforms? Yes, it can be redeemed on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Amazon Luna. How long will this offer be available?

The Siege team is excited to continue the Sixth Guardian Program in Y10S1 with a brand new bundle chosen by YOU, the Siege community. This season, Sixth Guardian is partnering once more with Worldwide Cancer Research, an organization funding visionary, game-changing cancer research around the world to start new cures. The “Sixth Guardian Hope” bundle will release on March 6th and features a full Azami set, as chosen by the Siege community in an online poll. One hundred percent of net proceeds (no less than $6 USD per bundle) will go to Worldwide Cancer Research to specifically contribute toward funding for cutting-edge breast cancer research. Starting on March 8th, we invite all Rainbow Six Siege creators and community members to join the movement by streaming or creating social media content over the weekend. We’ve put together a Creator Kit package available via the Ubisoft Creators Program for the occasion which includes stream overlays and assets. You can also download the kit here. SIXTH GUARDIAN HOPE BUNDLE This exclusive bundle includes a cosmetics set for Azami, and features her signature sleek suit accented with pink, the universal color for breast cancer. Specifically, the set includes: “Sixth Guardian Hope” Uniform “Sixth Guardian Hope” Headgear “Sixth Guardian Hope” Background Card “Sixth Guardian Hope” Charm The bundle will be available for a limited time. ABOUT WORLDWIDE CANCER RESEARCH Worldwide Cancer Research focuses on funding discovery research, the critical first stage of the research journey that uncovers knowledge that can lead to new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. Bright ideas come from anywhere, which is why they fund projects anywhere in the world. And they fund research into any type of cancer, because there are over 200 types that all need different cures. Since 1979, Worldwide Cancer Research has invested over £200 million in more than 2,000 research projects in 35 countries worldwide, leading to some remarkable breakthroughs. But with cancer rates increasing, and global discovery research funding decreasing, it is imperative to push forward faster and fund more new projects every year. This simply won't be possible without the continued support of incredible community of Curestarters - people who turn their compassion into action by supporting Worldwide Cancer Research’s work - for themselves, for their loved ones, and for the millions of people around the world affected by cancer. Becoming a Curestarter is a positive way to be part of something bigger and to contribute to vital research that will save lives. Many of you have already become Curestarters by supporting the previous “Sixth Guardian Health” bundle. We invite you to support “Sixth Guardian Hope” and recruit others to become Curestarters to help fund visionary, game-changing research around the world, and take us one step closer to a day when no life is cut short by cancer. Learn more about Worldwide Cancer Research here. WHAT RESEARCH WILL YOUR DONATIONS SUPPORT? All net proceeds from your donations will go to Worldwide Cancer Research, with no less than $6 USD per bundle going to the charity. SMART BOMBS: A NEW APPROACH Once cancer has spread, or metastasized, it often becomes incurable. A pioneering new team of researchers led by Professor Roberta Tasso at the University of Genoa in Italy have an ambitious plan: to find new ways to deliver drugs directly to hard-to-treat breast cancer tumors. By using nanoparticles that occur naturally in our bodies as 'smart bombs', the team hope to be able to knock out tumors even after cancer has spread. A MESSAGE FROM THE RESEARCHER ""I am truly delighted and honored that my project has been selected for the fundraising campaign in partnership with Ubisoft and the Rainbow Six Siege community. This project, while challenging, offers great potential to advance cancer treatment, and it is thanks to your support that we are able to push boundaries in such a high-impact area of research. We are incredibly grateful for your belief in our work, which we hope will have a tangible impact on cancer therapy in the future."" - Professor Roberta Tasso Together, the Siege community has already raised nearly $100k USD for Worldwide Cancer Research by supporting the “Sixth Guardian Health” bundle for Twitch. Let’s continue to push past that and help our partners support ground-breaking efforts in breast cancer research. If you’d like to support Worldwide Cancer Research further, you can make direct donations here. A MESSAGE FROM WORLDWIDE CANCER RESEARCH Years of collaborative and pioneering research have led to incredible breakthroughs in how we prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. But it is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and too many people still have to say goodbye to a loved one too soon. In 2022 there were an estima...",1740009840,

359550,Y10S1 Designer's Notes,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/a1c83293fbbb7307b037a0149f5672dfd068b232.jpg In this latest edition of Designer’s Notes, we are sharing details on the balancing changes process and why we will not be pushing additional changes this season. YEAR 10 SEASON 1 We have decided to let the game stabilize for a bit longer than usual in preparation for everything coming and start the new Siege era with more stable data overall. Every patch we release, even though we are building towards a fixed direction, adds more entropy into the mix, making it harder to evaluate the impact of every change. However, we wanted to take this opportunity to share some insights about our thought processes. BALANCING PROCESS INSIGHTS To begin with, in the context of strategy and tactics, the defensive team typically holds the advantage. It's like assaulting a fortress; expecting the attacking force to have equal chances of victory as the defending force is unrealistic. Defenders have the privilege of choosing the battlefield; they are essentially playing at home. In a game like Siege, defenders also alter the battlefield every round, while attackers have a mere 180 seconds to analyze and execute a new strategy based on the information gathered, which might only be reliable for a brief period. This is why we aim for a 55% defensive win rate with a 5% tolerance. The different matrices represent the big picture of the game and help us interpret its current state. We have plenty of them: different ranks, platforms, playlists, and even specific ones per map. Observing an outlier value triggers a discussion, not an immediate action. During these discussions, we focus on the overall vision of the game more than on the outlier. Siege has many moving parts, and even small changes can have significant consequences, which may not become apparent immediately and can take months or even years to fully manifest. This is why we continuously evaluate both new and old changes, as their effects on the game can vary from patch to patch. It's also important to highlight that buffs and nerfs are often two sides of the same coin. Buffing one operator typically means others are indirectly nerfed. As the buffed operator becomes more appealing, others with similar roles become less interesting, which has a similar effect to nerfing them. In reverse, nerfing an operator means that others are indirectly buffed and more appealing to use. When we see operators with very high presence, we see a reduction on variety. Playing and facing the same operators repeatedly can be boring and feel repetitive. Their ideal presence is around 13%, even though we don't aim strictly for this. If every operator were in their sweet spot data-wise, it would mean that everyone is viable in all situations, making operator selection feel meaningless. This is why we intend to make them situational, so the map, site, intel available, and team composition determine who is the best option. Every operator must be strong in the right situation but with flaws in the wrong one. On the other hand, operators with extremely low presence might be boring, not impactful enough, or simply not fitting into the current meta. And our approach is different depending on the reason. Regarding win deltas, they mostly represent how the operator is performing in the current meta rather than their inherent strength. We cannot say that Maverick is too weak when he can bypass any wall denial without help, or that Kapkan is too strong when there is always an Ash rushing without droning, leaving attackers one operator down 20 seconds into the round. COMMUNITY FEEDBACK Additionally to the hard data retrieved from your in-game matches, our teams also analyze your feedback via different means in order to have the best understanding of the current meta and what you, as players, have to say. There are two approaches to gather player feedback, one could be considered as indirect and the other as direct. For the former, the feedback is found through the comments you naturally share on social media or other platforms and generally touches broader topics. The latter, on the other hand, requires targeted investigations. The intel is then collected through workshops involving experienced players and community members, topic-specific surveys, and Seasonal surveys. Once gathered, the feedback data is then translated into digestible formats for a better understanding of the community concerns, thoughts and ideas. We will never say this enough: your feedback matters and changes the game. Please keep on sharing your thoughts on our different social media platforms and our dedicated Seasonal Surveys.

IN THIS UPDATE ANTI-CHEAT Status Overview MouseTrap - Mouse and Keyboard Detection on Console Rage Cheating & Gameplay Violations Lag Exploits Encryption - Binary Hardening Sanctions Final Thoughts ANTI-TOXICITY Reputation System Refresh Automated Text Chat Moderation Privacy Mode - Unacceptable Usernames Our Direction {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/d1b6625cacf22cc36946d8d966769b4be297020d.png In Operation Collision Point, we've brought changes to improve the experience for both PC and console players, with continued binary hardening improvements for PC, the new MouseTrap penalty for consoles, and more. Today, our Anti-Cheat team will cover how we got here and what they've been working on, while sharing new data and analytics. STATUS OVERVIEW CHEAT VENDOR EXITS We've touched on this before, but we'd like to share a little more on this here. Late last year, one of the most prevalent cheat vendors exited the Siege space. Leading up to this, the cheat vendor was either offline or being detected, meaning their cheats would be non-functional or result in a ban. This came from our multi-faceted approach to anti-cheat, combining measures in both detection and hardening. This has been a great success for Siege, and our mission is to continue making Siege less viable for cheat vendors. CHEATER REPORTS DECREASING {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/d1716b3ebf672b2f51fd43d5ee19a1b01329100c.jpg PC CHEATER REPORTS Cheater reports have been decreasing, and we've got all-new data to share on this. In the graph above, we can see that cheater reports have been consistently trending downward since the beginning of October, revealing that players are noticing the change in cheater presence. Cheater reports have now decreased by over 40% when compared to our highs of summer 2024, and year on year we've seen a drop upwards of 30%. CONSOLE CHEATER REPORTS Console cheater reports have remained largely stable throughout the year. Reports did see an increase at the start of December, though we believe the majority of these are due to the crossplay default setting bug that players had experienced at the launch of Y9S4. We remain focused on our console Anti-Cheat efforts, with more details on MouseTrap below. FUTURE UPDATES - OUR MISSION IS UNCHANGED The fight is not over. We know that other cheat makers will attempt to take advantage of the space left behind by a cheat vendor that has pulled out. The removal of this cheat creator changes very little for the Anti-Cheat team roadmap: we will keep investing and innovating in new hardening and detection technologies, to the betterment of Siege. MOUSETRAP - MOUSE & KEYBOARD DETECTION ON CONSOLE Reminder: MouseTrap is our console Anti-Cheat which works to detect devices that enable the use of mouse and keyboard. NEW PENALTY LIVE Y9S4 saw the release of the new MouseTrap penalty system. If detected 3 times, spoofers are forced into the PC matchmaking pool with PC recoil enabled for 90 days. This is a stark change in severity compared to the previous system, which would reduce its effects as soon as the player stopped using a spoofing device. Such a change was made possible by updates to the AI model which reinforced accuracy and further diminished false positives. Looking at the season launch we know that console players may not have felt the full impact of MouseTrap (as shown in the graph above with a rise in cheater reports at the start of December), with a bug enabling Console to PC crossplay by default, resulting in controller players being unknowingly matched with PC players who were legitimately using keyboard and mouse. Overall, our data shows that the system is working as expected, detecting and applying penalties to spoofing device users, forcing them into the PC pool. We are confident in our detection, though we know that some players have been able to bypass detection this season. This bypass method is currently being investigated, and we'll be enabling a fix for this soon. We are closely monitoring MouseTrap and will continue to do so as we ramp up its AI capabilities. Our team is looking into improvements and new ways to utilize AI, which will help us to bolster our detection of cheating on console. RAGE CHEATING & GAMEPLAY VIOLATIONS Reminder: Gameplay Violations are actions that are technically possible within the game engine but are in effect forbidden and not possible from a gameplay perspective, such as shooting while sprinting.Y9S3 has been our best season yet against rage cheating, thanks to a new system we implemented which detects Gameplay Violations. This new system has rendered the use of rage cheats a guaranteed ban, and at its peak, even outperformed our Data Ban system. With this foundational tech in place, it is now easier for the team to implement new Gameplay V...",1738683090,

359550,"Rainbow Six Siege is completely free to play right now, but you need to act fast","<strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong> was originally a tricky proposition. Between Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Counter-Strike, back in 2015, it felt like online shooters were driven more by outright aggression and pace than by tactics and teamwork. Ubisoft was trying to take the mechanics of slow-burn, single-player FPS classics like SWAT 4, Ghost Recon, and of course the R6 series itself, and make them work in competitive multiplayer. It wasn't easy, but nine years and dozens of seasons later, the studio has clearly made Siege's mix of brains and brawn into a success. XDefiant might be closing down, but with Year 9 Season 4 and Operation Collision Point underway, Rainbow Six Siege is as strong as ever, and now you can play it for the low, low price of zero dollars. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/free"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/update-crossplay"">Rainbow Six Siege update makes a dramatic change to reduce matchmaking times</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege-players-blast-new-membership-announcement"">Rainbow Six Siege players blast new membership announcement</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/reputation-system-beta"">Rainbow Six Siege reputation system will remain in beta for now</a> ",1733762241,

This notion had to be introduced to reflect the implementation of the pick & ban. Presence definition: pick rate of an Operator when not banned. Win Delta: The Win Delta is aggregated from Operator's Win Deltas per Bomb Site. OPERATOR BAN RATE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/7612f3ebe4a1e63f5883789eb45f894971cc5198.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/0c5d9aad2b243eb5546de29ab9781c051169bc5f.png OPERATOR BAN RATE {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/ac5a2da18091991eaf808d48bcb68ae241243845.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/8d0d1a8c17280486540b78e3cb63c7dfdf6696a5.png OPERATOR BALANCING BLACKBEARD Blackbeard's ability is designed to provide a defensive advantage while remaining lethal. Despite numerous adjustments to balance his ability, success has been limited. Currently, the Rifle Shield can withstand only 20 HP, making it unreliable for protection. This frustrates both Blackbeard and his opponents, as it can block a single headshot but leaves Blackbeard vulnerable. To address this frustration, we decided to eliminate the Rifle Shield and introduce a completely new gadget. The Blackbeard Remaster aims to balance his defensive and offensive capabilities. Additionally, we want Blackbeard to contribute more than just killing potential to his team. Blackbeard's new gadget is the H.U.L.L. Adaptable Shield. This shield functions like any other Ballistic Shield but with added features: - Rappel Shield: Blackbeard can change the shield's shape to use it while rappelling. - Breaching Dash: Blackbeard can perform a short, powerful dash using the H.U.L.L. Adaptable Shield's pneumatic system to breach Soft Walls, Barricades, Deployable Shields, Armor Panels, Talon Shields, and Kiba Barriers. After breaching, he will be concussed and slowed for a few seconds. - Big Guns: Blackbeard can use Primary Weapons (Mk-17 and SR-25) while wielding the Ballistic Shield. However, he cannot hip fire like other shield operators and will expose his upper body when aiming and reloading. We've aligned this new gadget with some changes to the Operator Balance aiming to compensate for his new fast breaching capabilities. Blackbeard will now move slower, as a 1 Speed / 3 Armor Operator. He no longer has access to the D-50, and the Stun grenades have been removed. We want Blackbeard to fulfill two main roles. As a Rappel Master, he should be able to sit comfortably on rappel behind his shield, watching the enemy and gathering intel. Additionally, he can now use the H.U.L.L. Adaptable Shield's breaching capabilities to push forward, hunt roamers with the team, and secure a path for the rest of the team. BASE STATS Armor: 3 Speed: 1 H.U.L.L. ADAPTABLE SHIELD Breaching Ability Max. resources: 4 Charges. 8 seconds Cooldown between use. LOADOUT H.U.L.L. Adaptable Shield Primary weapons: Mk-17 Damage increased to 44 (was 40) Magazine Size increased to 25 (was 20) Total ammunition increased to 226 (was 181) SR-25 Gadgets: Frag Grenades, Claymores. MONTAGNE The new fix we implemented for Ballistic Shield's guard break (more details below) made Montagne too vulnerable with the current configuration. The accumulative guard break strength allowed a single defender to take him down too easily. To address this, we have reduced the opening caused by a single melee attack. However, it's important to note that the overall opening a defender can create is now larger. Previously, with the third melee, the strength would be 40%, but with the new fix, it will be approximately 60%. Montagne must be smart when facing multiple defenders because if they collaborate, he won't be able to hold them anymore. LE ROC SHIELD Guard break animation strength when melee'd reduced to 20% (from 40%). SENS The new ability to turn the R.O.U. Projectors on and off will introduce a fresh layer of strategy when using Sens. This enhancement will make Sens' gameplay more dynamic, granting greater control over the gadget to precisely manage lines of sight. Defenders will need to exercise more caution when moving around, as the wall can disappear at any moment. Additionally, the projector's battery depletes only when the wall is active. Sens will have ample time to plan and deploy all the projectors without rushing, allowing for precise placement. To limit chaos and minimize potential mistakes, we have also reduce...",1732212126,

Each update and decision we make takes into account various elements such as player feedback, time allocated to ensure the quality of the features delivered, and more. With that in mind let's delve into this Mid-Season Roadmap Update! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/0ad2a32ff9ee4dea8fc99a484eb4513594f9229b.jpg ROADMAP UPDATES SHIELD NERF Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 The revamped shield mechanic was first released in Y9S1 and since then we've seen an evolution in their overall usage, becoming more relevant and impactful. It's now time for shields to be adjusted and to reduce their oppressiveness. PHANTOM PLAYER - IMPROVED LOBBY BALANCING Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 Phantom Player is coming to enhance the experience of all players. In a nutshell, the Phantom Player is a mathematical value, a ''6th player'', which will bring an extra layer of balancing to matchmaking. Concretely, the Phantom Player sees the skill disparity between players of a stack and adds the appropriate skill value to even out the matches depending on the number of players within this stack. CONSOLE TO PC CROSSPLAY 1.0 + MOUSETRAP IMPLEMENTATION Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 Console to PC Crossplay will enable PC and console to play together. This will work by allowing console players to join their PC friends, opting into the PC matchmaking pool. In Y9S4 MouseTrap will also force confirmed mouse and keyboard console players into PC matchmaking, with PC recoil values. CHEATER MATCH CANCELLATION Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 With Cheater Match Cancellation, once a cheater is confirmed and consequently banned, the match they are in will be automatically cancelled. This will lead to less time being spent by honest players in unfair matches, while ensuring that the legitimate players in these matches aren't incurring abandonment penalties or unjust Ranked losses. SIEGE CUP (BETA) - ALL PLATFORMS Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 The Siege Cup will provide a highly competitive experience on both PC and console, while remaining in its Beta phase to allow further testing. For more information, check out our FAQ. YING, SENS, & THUNDERBIRD Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 YING: Introducing a tweak to Ying aimed at reducing defender frustration. SENS: An update for Sens will expand the opportunities for more strategic plays. THUNDERBIRD: An adjustment for Thunderbird will help make her a more valuable asset for the team. AI CHAT MODERATION Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 AI will analyze and moderate all text chat messages in real-time, resulting in problematic messages being flagged or removed. Your messages will have an impact on your Reputation Standing, whether they are censored, flagged, or positive. REPUTATION SYSTEM REFRESH Status: Confirmed for Y9S4 This update will feel different from the Reputation System you know. We are actively working on the refreshed Reputation System for Y9S4 and are in the balancing stages right now, ensuring that the actions we're tracking have a meaningful and fair impact. DYNAMIC MATCHMAKING 1.0 Status: Delayed to Y10 A dynamic matchmaking feature for improved server allocation based on a broader set of players' data. This feature has been delayed allowing our Playlist team to focus their resources on Phantom Player, which is now coming earlier than was originally planned.

359550,PLAYER PROTECTION UPDATE - OCTOBER 2024,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/fbd2fab9955f05a2cf0f2565e2669242352fa472.jpg Today we'll be sharing updates on some of the developments we're making on our Anti-Cheat systems. We've also got updates covering Anti-Toxicity, including some info on changes that we've already rolled out. IN THIS UPDATE ANTI-CHEAT Current Status Encryption - Binary Hardening MouseTrap Detection Performance MouseTrap PC Matchmaking QB System Ban Data ANTI-TOXICITY Reputation System Refresh Update How It Will Work Automated Text Chat Moderation Unfair Abandonment Penalties Teamkill Kick Deactivation DBNO RFF Deactivation Privacy Mode Nickname Acceptance Next Steps {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/d1b6625cacf22cc36946d8d966769b4be297020d.png CURRENT STATUS The topic of cheating remains at the forefront for us here on the Rainbow Six Siege team. We're aware that cheating continues to affect high ranked players in most cases, however with the launch of Y9S3 seeing a decrease in cheating overall compared to S2, we know that we're finding the results needed to provide safer matches, more often. Below, we have updates on some of the topics we're working on, but not all; it's crucial that we're not giving any information away that could benefit cheaters. ENCRYPTION - BINARY HARDENING Reminder: Binary hardening is the act of using encryption and hardening techniques to update the game code base and enhance security, and we've continued to deploy these updates to the game with each patch. The launch of Y9S3 was a step forward in our efforts against cheating, with cheats being down for nearly an entire week. We can see that this was also felt by players, as we measured a stark decrease in cheater reports being submitted. Cheats are adapted over time however, and so while this was temporary, it does demonstrate that our hardening measures are having a meaningful impact in delaying the return of cheats. Previously, we also saw success in Season 2, when a security update resulted in a shorter delay to cheats coming back online. While this is an ongoing challenge, the delays we've seen are encouraging and to this end we've implemented further security fixes ready for Siege Cup, to help us maintain a fair and competitive environment, which is a top priority for us. We will keep pushing hardening updates throughout Y9S3 and of course, beyond. As we progress further, we'll continue to share our findings with you. MOUSETRAP - MOUSE & KEYBOARD DETECTION ON CONSOLE Reminder: MouseTrap is our console Anti-Cheat which works to detect devices that enable the use of mouse and keyboard. MOUSETRAP - DETECTION PERFORMANCE We've recently released an update to MouseTrap which has resulted in both an increase in detection performance and a reduction in false positives. As well as this, we're now completing tests for devices that aren't yet being recognized. MOUSETRAP - PC MATCHMAKING Since spoofing devices and controllers can be matched together, it's clear that frustration has remained. While working to release PC-Console Crossplay, which is coming in Y9S4, we've also been on track with its implementation into MouseTrap, which will force confirmed MnK users into PC matchmaking while automatically switching to the PC recoil values. We'll share more on this during the Season 4 reveal. QB SYSTEM Reminder: The QB System is one of our custom-built Anti-Cheat solutions designed to reinforce hardening by distributing different game executables to players while preventing tempering. Our top priority is ensuring the QB System stays robust in the fight against cheaters and cheat developers. Right now, our team is testing the next QB System Expansion prototype, and we'll provide more details soon about how this will impact players. BANS - DATA BANS + BATTLEYE BAN NUMBERS Before moving to Anti-Toxicity below, here's an updated view on our 2024 ban data, including new data for July, August, and September: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/8d8db7bba3219a6e83b2403d7f44d3b5b2a1222b.jpg ----- {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8328525/2c83a746a34d2ff4c1cf13c6f61506f51a579bb2.png REPUTATION SYSTEM REFRESH - UPDATE We are actively working on the refreshed Reputation System for Y9S4 and are in the balancing stages right now, ensuring that the actions we're tracking have a meaningful and fair impact. The focus of this system is to fulfil and stay true to our core pillars: transparency, understandability, and clarity. We know the system is already very complex, and we want to be sure to control its fairness before adding additional parameters, and so our mindset for this refresh is to ""do less but do better"", resulting in a system that's easier to understand and interact with. HOW IT WILL WORK This new system will feel different from the one you know, as we will be watching for negativity first, then positivity. Toxicity on its own will lead to a negative Standing, and positive behavior with minimal negativity will lead to a Standing of Exemplary. It's only in cases where a player is highly toxic over a number of ...",1729871490,

Here’s an overview of everything launching in Season 3. A new Defender named Skopós.

Skopós enters the battlefield in control of one as an Operator and the other as an Observation Tool protected by a reinforced shield. While she can only operate one at a time and will lose connection to both shells if one is destroyed, she can switch between them at will, making Skopós an effective intel and support Operator.
