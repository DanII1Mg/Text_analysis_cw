2807960,Battlefield 6 - Community Update - Winter Offensive Launch and Player Feedback,"Hi everyone,With this week’s release of Game Update 1.1.3.0 Winter Offensive, many of you jumped in right away, shared your first impressions, and highlighted issues and unexpected behaviors. Thank you for the quick, detailed feedback. It helps us move fast and stay focused on what matters most. We want to give you a clear status update on the issues we are tracking, the work already completed, and our near-term and future plans. The team has been reviewing all reports since the update, including items related to Breakthrough, the Firing Range, Portal, the Main Menu, and performance topics such as micro-stuttering on PC, along with several other issues raised by the community. Several items have already been identified, are being addressed, or have been resolved. We are preparing to publish hotfixes to resolve a number of these issues, currently targeting the below dates, while others will require additional investigation and validation before solutions can be finalized:December 12: SteamWe’re releasing this update early to resolve the Micro Stuttering issue. It also includes improvements to the Main Menu and the Firing Range based on your recent reports.December 15: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, EA appThis hotfix will include resolutions for issues related to the Main Menu and the Firing Range.Our goal is to keep you informed, show where resolutions are progressing, and set expectations for what’s coming next. Issues Identified After Update 1.1.3.0Below is an overview of the key issues identified since Update 1.1.3.0 went live, along with their current status and the work underway to address them. Battle Royale - Users remain stuck in air during insertionStatus: ResolvedWe have identified an issue in Battle Royale where players may remain stuck in the air viewing their aircraft instead of dropping in after the pre-round, and we have resolved this via a backend change. Battle Pass Tier Skipping with Winter Offensive Bonus PathStatus: ResolvedWe had identified an issue affecting Tier Skipping on the Winter Offensive Bonus Path, this was temporarily disabled across all platforms. Following a resolution this is now enabled once again and you are now able to tier skip within the Bonus Path. Changes to Soldier MomentumStatus: ResolvedWe have confirmed inconsistencies where players were losing too much momentum during successive jumps, as well as through sliding. These issues have now been resolved and players should now hold speed as intended prior to this Game Update. Daily Challenge RewardsStatus: ResolvedThe XP reward for Daily Challenges was unintentionally reduced from 5,000 to 3,500 XP. This has since been resolved, and the rewards have been restored to their original values. Conquest Ticket Count (1000 instead of 1200)Status: ResolvedConquest ticket counts were appearing lower than intended on some servers. We have implemented a resolution to restore the correct value of 1200. Main Menu NavigationStatus: Resolution Underway via HotfixSome players are experiencing a hard-lock on the bulletin panel or difficulty navigating menu tiles, or in some cases selecting Ice Lock and receiving the original variant of Manhattan Bridge. We have reproduced these issues and applied a temporary solution while a hotfix takes place shortly to address it fully. Micro Stutter taking place at set intervals (Steam)Status: Resolution Underway via HotfixWe have received multiple reports of recurring micro stutter during matches for players on Steam. The team is working through finalising a resolution to this. A temporary workaround for individuals is to set your online status within the friends list to Offline. A hotfix with a resolution is scheduled for December 12. Firing Range - Damage Display, Target Hit DetectionStatus: Resolution Underway via HotfixWe have confirmed inconsistencies in how hit registration and damage values are displayed at various distances in the Firing Range. We also identified a separate issue where targets were not correctly registering bullet impacts. A hotfix is planned to address this behavior across all platforms. Bot Stats TrackingStatus: Resolution in DevelopmentEarlier this year, we removed Bot kills from player stats but encountered a related issue that prevented us from removing deaths in the same way. This resulted in inconsistencies on the stats page, and while we work on resolving the underlying bug, we have temporarily re-enabled Bot kills to keep values aligned. Our goal is to fully resolve this issue in future updates, and we are currently investigating improvements to the profile page that allow customization of what statistics you want to show, providing you with more ways to express your Battlefield career. Instances of Rubberbanding with Min-Spec SystemsStatus: Resolution in DevelopmentPC players with CPUs near the minimum spec and running low graphics settings may see rubberbanding, hit-reg issues, or latency-like symptoms if the game can’t maintain the 60Hz simulation rate due to ...",1765468852,

2807960,BATTLEFIELD 6 GAME UPDATE 1.1.3.0,"Update 1.1.3.0 delivers a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6, improving soldier clarity, weapon reliability, vehicle behaviour, audio consistency, and overall gameplay flow. This update also includes several quality-of-life improvements across UI, HUD, and controller aiming options, along with map-specific updates designed to stabilise objective play and reduce round-end matchmaking frustration.We also made improvements to reduce cases where player settings could be reset when updating the game to the newest version. While this behaviour should now occur less frequently, we are still seeing isolated instances and expect to fully resolve the issue in an upcoming update.As always, thank you for continuing to share your feedback which helps us refine and evolve the Battlefield 6 experience.New Content: Winter OffensiveNew Time-Limited Map: Ice Lock Empire State. A winter-shrouded version of Empire State featuring frozen streets and seasonal environmental visuals.New Time-Limited Multiplayer and Gauntlet Mode: A themed event mode playable across Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations on Ice Lock Empire State featuring the event-limited “Freeze” mechanic.New Melee Weapon: the Ice Climbing Axe. Unlocked through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path.Portal updates: Ice Lock Empire State is available for use in supported Portal experiences during the event window.Battle Pass: Winter Offensive Bonus Path: an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, XP Boosters, and the Ice Climbing Axe.Major Updates for 1.1.3.0Improved hit registration across situations that previously felt unreliable, including quick aim adjustments, firing before a zoom completes, and close-quarters fights with many players. These updates make bullet impacts more predictable and damage feedback easier to read in the moment.Enhanced close-range soldier visibility, with stronger character highlights and improved prone animations to help soldiers stand out more clearly in low-contrast or visually busy areas.Refined weapon handling for more consistent accuracy, addressing issues with first-shot behaviour, recoil interaction, and attachment alignment so weapons feel more stable and predictable during firefights.Improved reliability across several core gadgets, including updates to the LWCMS Portable Mortar, Supply Pouch, Smoke Cover, and traversal tools to ensure they behave consistently and provide clearer feedback.Strengthened vehicle clarity and interaction, fixing issues around damage zones, HUD overlaps, seat reticules, and camera behaviour to make vehicle play more stable for both drivers and passengers.Updated Breakthrough and Rush layouts on multiple maps to improve attacker–defender balance, smooth out sector flow, and adjust vehicle distribution based on match outcome data and player feedback.Delivered a broad audio pass improving combat readability, including clearer footsteps and movement cues, more reliable armour-break feedback, and tuning across several high-priority gameplay sounds. AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTSAudioWith this update, we’ve made a wide range of audio improvements, including a dedicated tuning pass on footsteps to make movement clearer, easier to locate, and more readable at different distances. We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches. To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load. These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.

2807960,REDSEC - Community Update – Armor,"Hey everyone,The team is incredibly excited to see all the fun you’re having with REDSEC. We’ve poured years of work into it, and watching your clips, reading your feedback, and hearing your concerns has been fantastic. Thank you for playing and for sharing your thoughts.With tons of REDSEC matches played since the launch of Battle Royale and Gauntlet, we’ve seen a lot of feedback on the topic along with some recurring questions and misunderstandings around how armor works in REDSEC, how it differs from main Battlefield 6 Multiplayer (MP), and where we might be looking at bugs versus intentional design. So today we’d like to go in depth on the topic of armor and cover:Our philosophy for armor in REDSECHow this ties back to Battlefield 6 MPA deep dive on current armor mechanics from Ryan, the lead designer on the armor systemOur Armor Philosophy in REDSECWhen we set out to build the Battle Royale experience, one of our big goals was to keep as much parity with Battlefield 6 Multiplayer as possible, while still delivering the core fundamentals of the Battle Royale genre.We want skills and muscle memory you build in one experience to transfer into the others. If you learn recoil patterns, ranges, and damage breakpoints in MP, that knowledge should mostly still apply when you drop into REDSEC.At the same time, Battle Royale has some unique needs:High stakes: One fight can end your match.Looting: Gear progression is core to the experience.Map scale & pacing: Engagements tend to be mid- to long-range, which already lines up nicely with Battlefield’s overall DNA.Because of that, we made lootable infantry armor a key area where REDSEC intentionally diverges from standard MP tuning.What Armor Is Meant to DoArmor’s job in REDSEC is to extend time-to-kill (TTK) so you have a bit more breathing room in high-stakes fights. We want armor to impact how long you live, not make weapons feel totally different between modes.So our guiding principle is to leave core gun mechanics and soldier health damage the same across experiences, and tune REDSEC by adjusting damage vs. armor (extra health) instead.That way, a weapon feels familiar whether you’re in MP, Gauntlet, or Battle Royale. We can also make changes that only affect REDSEC by tweaking damage vs. armor, without breaking weapon balance elsewhere.We feel we landed armor in a good spot for the launch of REDSEC, but this isn’t “set and forget.” We’ll keep monitoring your feedback and our data, and we’ll make future balance passes where needed.Now, let’s hand it over to Ryan for the more detailed breakdown.Armor & Damage – A Deep DiveHi! I’m Ryan.For those who don’t know me, I’ve been around the Battlefield franchise in one form or another since BF1, and in various Battlefield communities back in the BF3/BF4 days. For REDSEC, I’m the lead designer of the armor system, and I’d like to walk you through how armor works, how weapon damage plays into it, and how it differs from the rest of Battlefield 6.Armor Values in REDSECLet’s start with some basic numbers:Armor in Gauntlet: 40 HPArmor in Battle Royale: 80 HP total (2 plates at 40 HP each)Think of armor as extra health layered on top of your standard soldier health. Once that armor is gone, everything works like you’re used to from other Battlefield 6 experiences.How We Think About DamageEvery weapon in Battlefield 6 has a damage profile. That profile is primarily driven by the caliber of bullet it fires. A specific caliber (for example, 7.62x39mm) has a core damage profile. When that caliber is used across different weapon archetypes (like rifles, carbines, LMGs), we may tweak it slightly, but they still share underlying values and behavior.For REDSEC specifically, each caliber effectively has two damage curves: Damage vs. Soldier Health and Damage vs. Armor.In REDSEC, we only adjust weapon damage against armor. Once armor breaks, that weapon will deal the same damage to soldier health, at the same ranges, as it does in the rest of Battlefield 6.The Two Big Systemic AdjustmentsWe currently make two systemic adjustments to how infantry weapons interact with armor in REDSEC.1. Extended Damage Drop-off Ranges vs. ArmorAll weapons have damage “steps” at different ranges (max damage, then lower damage as range increases). For damage vs. armor, we extend those drop-off ranges by 10 meters.REDSEC fights tend to happen at longer ranges (the larger map size and extended engagement ranges found on Fort Lyndon). Extending the effective ranges vs. armor helps weapons feel more consistent between MP and REDSEC, even though the context is different.This adjustment applies to all primary and secondary weapons.2. Lowering Extreme Close-Range Damage vs. Armor for Automatic WeaponsFor automatic weapons, we make another key change vs. armor. The first, very close-range max damage step against armor is essentially removed (or significantly reduced). In cases where we have a Carbine variant of a bullet (like 7.62x39mm vs. 7.62x39mm_Carbine), we...",1764864031,
2807960,Battlefield 6 - Community Update – Latest Updates Ahead of Winter Offensive,"Hello everyone, Welcome to our latest Community Update for Battlefield 6! With Update 1.1.2.0 settling in, we are taking a moment to share a deeper look at ongoing and upcoming work across the Battlefield Studios as we prepare for the Season 1 Winter Offensive update. Latest ImprovementsHere is a recap of recent adjustments before we dive into the upcoming changes.Escalation - On November 18, we increased the time required to capture objectives and territory in Escalation by roughly 20%. This keeps the mode’s high-energy pace while giving players more room for tactical decisions, better reactions, and smoother, more strategic matches. Your feedback has been positive about your experience in Escalation after the changes, and we will continue monitoring both internal data and community feedback.Challenges - On November 19, alongside the 1.1.2.0 Update, we made several changes and fixes to the Challenges system. While this has alleviated several issues with progression and reward tracking, we’re still seeing reports from players that not all challenges properly unlock their rewards after finishing them. The team is investigating, and we’ll provide an update as we get more traction on this. Anticheat - On November 28, our Anticheat team provided an update on the current state of anticheat, how the Match Infection Rate is trending, how we use it to help measure game quality, and what’s next for them.Portal - ICYMI, Downtown, Marina, Sandbox maps are now available in Portal, through REDSEC, and we’re excited to see what experiences you’ll create in these new areas.Winter OffensiveUpdate 1.1.3.0, Winter Offensive will be arriving on December 9, and the Update Notes are incoming over the next few days. Below you’ll find some of the highlights.Audio Improvements With this update, we have made a broad set of audio improvements, including better prioritization of important combat and vehicle sounds, and a comprehensive pass on footsteps to improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game. We have also continued to work on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as vehicles or footsteps, to sometimes not play as intended, which has been particularly noticeable on larger Battle Royale maps.Mode Adjustments Across Rush and Breakthrough, we’re making major updates focused on improving attacker flow, reducing defender oversaturation, and tightening clarity around objectives. Our goal is to make each push feel more readable, fair, and momentum-based without undermining strong defensive play.In Breakthrough, capture volumes and vehicle availability have been updated across several maps. These changes are guided by your feedback and internal data to help bring win rates closer together for both teams. As one example, Siege of Cairo now features an additional attacker tank in Sectors 1 and 3, along with an updated capture area on B to give attackers a clearer foothold.In Rush, M-COM locations on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak have been adjusted to give attackers more reliable access and to smooth out the flow between sectors.Across both modes, multiple capture zones have been reshaped or clarified so players understand more clearly where to contest or defend. Vehicle spawns have also been rebalanced on several maps to better support attackers where pushes tended to stall and to reduce setups where defenders held overwhelming vehicle advantages. These updates are intended to reduce bottlenecks, remove frustration points, and create more consistent and engaging fights around objectives.Beyond these highlights, we have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more, which you will see detailed in the full notes.Lastly, beyond the Winter Offensive update, we are also looking into recent performance issues reported by some players and are reviewing data to understand where improvements are needed.Combat SystemsIn this update we have also made broad improvements across our combat systems to help deliver more consistent, predictable, and responsive gameplay.Hit Registration and Netcode We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement. With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity.In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how dama...",1764777609,

Evolving Battlefield LabsAs Battlefield Labs continues to grow, we are expanding how we test new gameplay throughout our development phases to gather clearer insights, involve more players, and validate upcoming experiences more effectively. Looking ahead, we'll host two main types of play opportunities for Battlefield Labs:Planned Play Sessions - these are either experimental, or future focused and recurring sessions around specific features or content that we want to validate ahead of release, giving players the chance to experience upcoming updates early and help shape their final form.Quick, short-notice sessions - these sessions are put together on short notice and allow us to gather rapid insights on focused gameplay changes that benefit from immediate community feedback.Lastly, we are investigating new and smoother ways to make future Labs sessions accessible for more players. We’ll share more information as details evolve. Looking AheadIn the months ahead, we’ll use Battlefield Labs to look at a broader range of early concepts and experimental scenarios that benefit from real player insight. Beyond that, we are preparing future Labs sessions that explore changes to map layouts, pacing, and alternative team compositions such as smaller player counts or vehicle-focused setups. As we continue to grow Battlefield Labs, it will continue to be a reliable space for testing early ideas, gathering focused feedback, and involving a wider range of players in shaping what comes next for Battlefield across areas such as:New maps and experiencesNew modes and experimental rulesetsPrototype mechanics and systemsEnvironmental changesFuture seasonal beats before they fully solidifyStability and performanceGet InvolvedWe’re excited for the return of Battlefield Lab and to resume our playtesting efforts to build the future of Battlefield alongside you. Learn more about Battlefield Labs and sign up to EA Playtesting on our website today, and join the Battlefield Discord to join the discussion and stay updated on the latest information.

2807960,Battlefield 6 - Anticheat Update - Season 1,"Battlefield 6 is officially live — and what a launch it’s been! Over the record-breaking Launch and its initial weeks, players around the world dove in for millions of matches and a lot of conversation about our battle against cheaters.In a past Javelin blog, we’ve talked about measuring cheating through what we call Match Infection Rate (MIR) — our measure of confidence that at least one cheater impacted any particular match. You can interpret this as the chance that you as a player would encounter a cheater in your matches. We prefer using this to know whether we are being successful or not as opposed to just volumes of enforcement such bans because even though we’ve been busy blocking, kicking, suspending and banning cheaters, it doesn’t mean much if we haven’t protected your play experience. This helps make sure we focus not just on catching cheaters after they have already cheated and ruined your match, but that we are effectively keeping them from ever producing an impact to begin with.We’re proud to share that ~98% of all matches were fair and free of cheater impacts during the week following launch — meaning our average Match Infection Rate (MIR) was ~2%. That means almost every player who jumped into the Battlefield enjoyed a level playing field.A Quick Look Back: What We Learned in the Open Beta The Open Beta was invaluable for tuning our detection systems, operations workflows, and compatibility processes. We took those learnings and enhanced them for launch, directly contributing to the stability and strength you’ve all experienced so far.Throughout Open Beta, we had the opportunity to put our anti-cheat technology and operations teams to the test:Over 1.2 million cheat attempts were blocked — we removed tens of thousands of cheaters. We even banned some over-confident cheaters who were live-streaming their cheats in real time.We drove a significant increase in fair matches — from 93.1% at the start to nearly 98% by the end of the final day.Secure Boot adoption jumped from 62.5% to 92.5% — we wanted to thank you for getting this enabled so quickly and share that this enabled us to leverage it in various ways at launch with confidence. You should have seen a tank decal in your inbox in-game as a thank you if you were part of those players enabling the feature.Since Launch: Results & Impact Month 1 Over the launch weekend, EA Javelin Anticheat prevented more than 367,000 cheat attempts — less than during comparable Open Beta weekends but in line with the current number of cheat developers we are tracking. This has grown to 2.39 million cheat attempts blocked to date.Across all of our PC players so far, we are down to 1.5% of people not being able to activate Secure Boot on PC — thanks to your feedback, efforts by our Fan Care team, and involvement of some key community contributors and will continue to sort through remaining edge cases. Secure Boot isn’t a silver bullet to stop all cheating; but it is a barrier in of itself and enables other barriers. It helps enhance our detections to make each one just that extra bit harder for cheat developers. It can be circumvented, everything can, but sometimes even experts forget that those circumventions also light up lots of indicators; just getting around a barrier doesn’t mean we didn’t watch them the whole time as they dripped paint back to their nest for us to hammer drop their whole community.We are presently aware of, and have multiple detections for, 190 cheat related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers and their communities. Since launch 183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely. While there are still clips circulating of cheaters claiming to be undetected, it’s far more likely than not that when you see gameplay of someone claiming to cheat undetected, they are already banned or have a hammer incoming. This successful disruption of the cheater community is encouraging. But, we know that bad actors will keep testing our defenses, trying new ways to break through. We are constantly monitoring these new threats and are ready to respond, but these early results show that our layered defense strategy is delivering the fair experience players deserve.What’s NextIn the war against cheating, we’re just getting started. Here’s what’s coming next:Explore Additional OS Security Features.You may have noticed security features beyond Secure Boot like TPM 2.0, HVCI and VBS are part of the Battlefield 6 system requirements. It’s important to note that these are operating system security features, and in general are good security posture to have enabled for your machine and will help avoid any disruptions in playing BF6 when enforcing that requirement becomes necessary.Enforce against Cheating Hardware.Some of you might have seen various articles and screenshots of EA communications about users being banned because of use of cheating hardware. While most of these are humoro...",1764345627,

To access the Free Trial, simply download the free-to-play Battlefield: REDSEC experience on your preferred gaming platform. If you already play REDSEC, all your progress - Career Rank, Hardware Unlocks and Levels, Customization items, etc. - carries over to this Free Trial. All that progress also carries over to the full Battlefield 6 experience upon purchase; this Free Trial is your opportunity to try before you buy and keep everything you earn when it’s over.If you already own Battlefield 6, now is the time to convince those friends who haven’t experienced Battlefield to squad up during the long weekend.Here’s everything the Free Trial has to offer, including some tips & tricks to ensure you’re on the winning team:Initiation Breakthrough - An Introduction to Battlefield 6Held on Siege of Cairo, this playlist is a recommended entry point for those new to the Battlefield franchise, or who want a slightly more casual experience against both players and Bots.Initiation Breakthrough is a 48 player and Bot Multiplayer experience where teams go head-to-head in an intense frontline battle.One team of players and Bots are the Attackers, while the other team are the Defenders. The Attackers must capture objectives in a Combat Zone sector before they run out of lives. Whenever the Attackers capture all objectives in a sector, the battle moves to a new sector up until they reach the final sector at the Defender’s true headquarters. The game ends when the Attackers claim victory by capturing all sectors or when the Defenders reduce Attacker lives to zero (and winning the game).To secure a sector, Attackers must control all of the Defenders’ owned objectives at the same time. An objective is a small area labelled on the map with a letter (A or B); standing in - or sitting in a vehicle within - the zone fills up a progress meter which, when full, claims the objective for a team. Initiation Breakthrough, like Initiation Battle Royale in REDSEC, is a great way to familiarize yourself with online Battlefield Multiplayer. While the Firing Range (available via the Loadouts section of the main menu) is great for testing weapons against targets, Initiation Breakthrough can be a great warm-up for learning your Class benefits - passive abilities and Gadgets, for example - and how your weapons fare in actual engagements. Don’t worry about wins and losses here; Initiation is for learning purposes and rallying the squad together before venturing into other Multiplayer playlists.With that in mind, here are five tips specific to the Breakthrough mode for those focused on winning:Five Tips for Initiation BreakthroughTHE MORE THE MERRIER. The more teammates are on an objective, the faster its progress meter fills. Work with your squad - and across the entire team - to collectively capture objectives to advance (as an Attacker) or deny progress (as a Defender).IT’S BEST TO CONTEST. When both teams are on an objective, progress stalls. Especially as a defender, be a nuisance and attempt to remain on objectives as long as possible until they are under your team’s control.ON DEFENSE? HOLD A UNITED FRONT. The Defending team wins Breakthrough by creating an unbreakable, undivided line of defense that the Attackers cannot advance through to get to objectives. Using environmental cover pieces, suppressing fire, and clear communication, work together with fellow Defenders to quickly reduce Attacker lives before they can make significant objective progress.ON ATTACK? FIND A WEAKNESS, GET CREATIVE. Attackers succeed by finding holes in the enemy’s defense. Perhaps a flank route is uncovered, or all defenders are focused on a single objective when two are available. Learn the map, then use Gadgets and Vehicles to find new paths to victory: a wall or building between objectives can be gone over with an Assault Ladder or toppled with sledgehammers and rocket launchers, a Recon Drone can scout ahead and explode enemy mines, or sometimes, the best offense is an army of defibrillator-wielding Supports bringing back reinforcements every few seconds. OVERTIME MEANS IT AIN’T’ OVER TIL’ IT’S OVER. So long as progress is being made on a zone, Attackers can still advance to the next sector - or win - even when all their lives are expired. Don’t give up until the last zone is captured or the last Attacker is off an objective!Team Tactical Modes Infused with Battlefield DNA - Sabotage and Team DeathmatchFeel more familiar with smaller, team tactical modes?

2807960,Introducing Competitive Battlefield REDSEC: Elite Series and Open Series,"The greatest Battlefield moments happen when squads are pushed to their limits – when the path to victory demands ingenuity, teamplay, and gunplay. We want to create and support an ecosystem that champions unforgettable squad gameplay, one that empowers players to push the limits of what a squad can do. When we showcase the greatest players in our franchise, we want that action to be as intense - and fun - for them to play as it is exciting for our community to watch. Our journey to providing a better competitive Battlefield environment, in partnership with our community, starts with today’s announcement:The Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series, launching on Wednesday, December 10, 2025.Designed to introduce more competitive play to the franchise while also giving our community a new way to rise through the ranks, the Elite Series is the premiere destination of Battlefield competition, showcasing the absolute best competitive Battlefield REDSEC has to offer on the global stage through Battle Royale and Gauntlet.Competitive Battlefield shouldn’t just be for professional players: we want it to be open to everyone. Alongside our Elite Series, we are also proud to announce our Open Series as the official REDSEC community competition, which begins on Friday, December 12, 2025.The Open Series gives players of all skill levels the opportunity to compete; it’s your squad’s chance to hone and showcase your skills. With the right amount of practice and dedication in the Open Series, your squad can advance to the Elite Series to battle with the best in the world.All competitions will take place in a cross-platform and cross-input environment - whether you play on controller or mouse & keyboard, PC or console, we are calling all players to prove themselves in both the REDSEC Elite and Open Series.Both the Elite and Open Series are our first steps into an official competitive experience for Battlefield, and we plan on collaborating with the community to develop future competitions in our core Multiplayer modes.Ahead of the first competition days on December 10 and 12, here’s what you need to know about the Elite Series and Open Series for Battlefield REDSEC, with more details to follow closer to the first competition dates in December:REDSEC Elite Series - Format and How to WatchThe Elite Series is a weekly series of competitive cash cups split across three regions - The Americas, Europe / Middle East / Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) - and features over $1 million USD in prize money during its first season from December 10 to January 18.For this inaugural REDSEC Elite Series, we’re inviting 50 team captains from each region to handpick their dream squad of 4. These 600 total competitors not only represent the best Battlefield players in our community, but also the top FPS talent in the world. Each region’s 50 squads will compete in a unique competitive format: A series of six REDSEC Battle Royale matches, culminating in the top eight squads fighting head-to-head in a final showdown in the cutthroat, knockout-style elimination mode known as Gauntlet. This format is repeated over three Qualifying Match Days, with squads earning Elite Series Points for their performance. Compared to a regular, non-Elite Series Gauntlet that can be played in REDSEC, the competitive version of Gauntlet hones in on specific map and mode combinations, along with an extended round timer. Over time, we look forward to community feedback on how we can continue iterating on Gauntlet to create the most competitive experience possible.After three Qualifying Match Days, the top-25 squads with the most Elite Series Points will advance to the regional Season Finals.All competitions will be held online. Elite Series Qualifying Match Days will be streamed by all competitors, with Battlefield Studios hosting the Season Finals broadcast for each region.To ensure both entertainment and competitive integrity, we pre-vetted all 150 team captains for compliance, and will run all Elite Series competitions on official high-performance game servers in strategically placed data centers protected by our Javelin anti-cheat system.The Season 1 Prize Pool features over $1 million USD across all three regional finals, as well as tens of thousands of dollars for the top four teams of each match across all three Qualifying Match Days and the Season Finals.Specifically, the Americas region will have a $50,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, as well as a $500,000 USD prize pool split across all participating squads in the Finals Gauntlet. The APAC and EMEA regions will feature a $20,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, as well as a $285,000 USD prize pool for the Finals Gauntlet.And of course, Twitch Drops will be enabled for each Qualifying Match Day - and the season finals - to celebrate our new competitive initiative.Elite Series Season 1 ScheduleExact start times for all regions will be announced closer to the first Qualifying Match Day on ...",1763660106,

2807960,BATTLEFIELD 6 GAME UPDATE 1.1.2.0,"This update delivers a broad set of improvements to soldier responsiveness, aim consistency, animation fidelity, and overall stability across Battlefield 6. We’ve also introduced a new limited-time mode, refined Aim Assist behaviour, and resolved a large number of weapon, gadget, and vehicle issues based on community feedback. The update will be available tomorrow, November 18th, at 09:00 UTC. New Content: California ResistanceNew Map: Eastwood. A map with the Southern California theme.Variations of this map will be available for all official modes.Conquest mode on this map will include tanks, helicopters, and the Golf Cart.New Time-Limited Mode: Sabotage. A themed event mode focused on demolition and counterplay.New Weapons: DB-12 Shotgun and M357 Trait Sidearm. Gauntlet mode to include a new mission type: Rodeo. This mission provides multiple vehicles for players to fight over and battle with each other with. Players earn bonus points for defeating enemies while in a vehicle. Portal updates: Sandbox map. This option will let Portal experience builders start with a more level playing field to bring their imagination to life. The Golf Cart vehicle is available for use in building experiences. Battle Pass: The California Resistance bonus path becomes available for a limited time. New underbarrel attachment: Slim Handstop, unlocked via Challenge.New feature coming later in the update: Battle Pickups. These powerful weapons will be available in specific experiences and Portal with limited ammunition but pack enough firepower to help turn the tide of battle in your favor. Major Updates for 1.1.2.0Aim Assist has been reset to its Open Beta tuning, restoring consistent infantry targeting behaviour across all input types.Improved input latency and stick response for controllers, providing smoother aiming and more responsive soldier movement.Weapon accuracy and dispersion tuning: fixed unintended weapon dispersion increase rates and improved non-Recon sniper rifle accuracy while globally reducing dispersion across all weapon types.Challenge and progression clarity improvements make requirements easier to understand and track.Major polish pass to deployable gadgets, including the LWCMS Portable Mortar, LTLM II Portable Laser Designator, and Supply Crate systems.Fort Lyndon added to Portal, expanding available segments for community-created experiences. AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTAim AssistAs we got closer to launch, we revisited aim assist tuning based on internal testing and the full range of maps and combat distances coming with release. Our goal was to make aim assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and Open Beta.At launch, we increased slowdown at longer ranges, but once the game went live, we saw that this made high-zoom aiming feel less smooth and harder to control.After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim assist back to the values some of you experienced during Open Beta and Battlefield Labs. This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings.This change keeps aim slowdown consistent across all ranges, helping with muscle memory and providing a steadier, more reliable feel as we move into future seasons. CHANGELOG PLAYER:Aim Assist: fully reset to Open Beta tuning, with related options reset to default to ensure consistency.Fixed an issue where Vehicle Stick Acceleration Presets would affect Infantry Aiming Left/Right Acceleration option availability.Fixed an issue where setting Stick Acceleration Presets to “Standard” would set the Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options incorrectly to 50% instead of 70%.Fixed missing Infantry and Vehicle prefixes in captions for Stick Acceleration Presets and Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options.Fixed an issue where stick deadzones would ignore the first 10% of movement if using a PS5 Controller on PC.Fixed an issue where player movement (Left Stick) would not register until beyond 30% of travel past the deadzone.Fixed joystick aiming input behaviour.Added a short sprint “restart” animation when landing from small heights.Added new death animations for sliding and combat-dive states.Fixed a diving loop when entering shallow water.Fixed an issue preventing players from vaulting out of water in certain areas.Fixed an issue preventing takedown initiation against an enemy soldier if the enemy soldier already initiated a takedown against a friendly player.Fixed an issue where a dragged player could face the wrong direction if turning quickly.Fixed an issue where holding a grenade while jumping, sliding, or diving froze the first-person pose.Fixed an issue where switching weapons while drag-reviving would break the reviver’s first-person view.Fixed an issue where the Assault Class extra grenade ability would not grant two grenades on spawn.Fixed an issue where weapons could become invisible when ...",1763404278,
2807960,"Battlefield 6 is taking a big swing with its Eastwood map, and it could help salve the game's biggest complaint","""It's not about size, it's how you use it,"" is a rather crass way to describe map design, but I firmly believe it's the reason why many of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>'s maps have left players unsatisfied. To get big map energy in smaller sandboxes, you need to nail the illusion of space. From what I've seen so far, Battlefield 6's upcoming Eastwood map is going to provide some much-needed breathing room, despite its suburban trappings.

2807960,Community Update – Latest Updates Ahead of California Resistance,"To the Battlefield Community, With Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC, we’ve launched two massive experiences. From Support players pulling off clutch drag-and-revive saves to squads executing flawless REDSEC pushes and creators redefining what’s possible in Portal, you’ve shown us what Battlefield can be. For our teams across Battlefield Studios, this is just the start. We’ve been watching, reading, listening, and we’re hard at work on how we will evolve the experiences for you all. We’re focused, fired up, and getting it done because Battlefield has always been at its best when we build it together, as we have done on our journey through Battlefield Labs, our Open Beta, launch and the current Season 1. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45712411/94e579d0db7599388f823735dac90b3ab3ef8ca3.png The California Resistance Update arrives November 18 with Eastwood, our second new map of Season 1 that is primed for All-Out-Warfare, along with new weapons, the ultimate vehicle addition for creative mayhem, and more. Latest Live UpdatesIn our previous Community Update, we shared how your feedback has been guiding our work on performance, balance, and core gameplay improvements. Let’s take a look at what’s been updated so far and what’s next.Casual Breakthrough launched on November 1 as a more relaxed way to experience Battlefield while still earning progression and completing challenges. Featuring smaller teams and Bot support, the mode gives players room to learn, experiment, and level up weapons. We are exploring additional maps for the rotation while keeping the balance between player and bot counts, and we are also considering a similar Casual Conquest mode for the future.Challenge and Assignment updates went live on November 5, and we’ve already seen completion rates improve across the board. Our goal with these changes is to make daily and weekly challenges feel achievable within a few hours of focused play, while keeping certain cosmetic rewards as longer-term goals for dedicated players. We’ll continue monitoring data and feedback to make sure this balance feels right.Bots were reintroduced to Verified Experiences on November 6 in response to player feedback. Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush now each support up to 12 bots, and rounds begin once 8 players have joined to maintain a balanced experience between players and Bots. Bots grant reduced XP, while player XP remains at 100%, and all challenges remain completable. PvE bots in Custom Portal Experiences were unaffected by this change.Several major issues were resolved in our November 11 Quality of Life Update. We addressed a behavior that allowed players to reach unintended areas by striking a Recon Drone with the Sledgehammer, and Lock-Guided Missiles now respond correctly to enemy countermeasures such as flares. We also fixed issues that caused weapon dispersion to behave incorrectly when transitioning from sprinting to aiming down sights or when scaling with movement speed. Dispersion now properly reflects stance and movement. In Active Development Coming with California Resistance (November 18)Weapon Dispersion (Bloom) Fixes: We’ve made a small tuning pass that reduces how quickly dispersion and recoil build up during sustained fire. Dispersion adjustments apply to all weapons, while most also receive recoil tuning. These changes make weapons feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges where we’ve seen players engage more often. We’ll continue to monitor these updates and refine them based on gameplay data and community feedback.Lighting Adjustments Visibility Upgrades: We’ve made further improvements to soldier visibility, particularly when transitioning between interiors and exteriors. These updates enhance exposure balance to make enemies easier to see in varying lighting conditions. We’ll continue refining visibility and related visual effects based on player feedback.Challenge Clarity Updates: We’ve refined challenge descriptions and tracking to make your progress easier to understand and follow.Fort Lyndon in Portal: More segments of Fort Lyndon will be available in Portal for creating community experiences.Aim Assist Adjustments: We’ve adjusted Aim Assist to make aiming feel smoother and more predictable, helping players build stronger muscle memory. Tuning is now similar to the Open Beta experience. As a result, Infantry Aim Assist and Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown have been reset to match the new values, so try the update before making changes. Note: Infantry Aim Assist Zoom Snap settings are only active in Single Player and Portal experiences, and not in Multiplayer.Targeting the Winter Offensive Update (December 9) In addition to the new limited-time event and new melee weapon, here’s a quick peak at a few of the other updates that are in progress for Winter Offensive:Vehicle Balance Pass: We’ve made an initial tuning pass to smooth out some of the biggest balance outliers between vehicles.

2807960,Community Update – Changes to Challenges & Assignments,"Recently, we introduced updates that increase the XP earned in official matches and reduce the XP needed for the first 20 attachment ranks. As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback. Some of the adjustments in this update are substantial, and we wanted to share more context on how we arrived at them. This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length. Assignments will continue to range from goals you can complete through regular play to a few that reward true mastery, particularly those tied to cosmetic items. Some of the original criteria did not fully reflect that intent, and we have updated them to make their difficulty and purpose clearer. The first set of changes went live today through a server-side update and are available immediately. Any progress you’ve already made will automatically be applied when you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet based on the updated criteria. As previously indicated, the scale of our plans for Challenges and Assignments are large and will take place over multiple server-side and client-side updates, expect additional updates in the future. We wanted to get the first set of changes into your hands as soon as possible while we prepare further game updates. We’ll follow-up with more details on the rollout in the future. In this first set of changes we made a total of 90+ adjustments to Challenges and Assignments. Below we’ve highlighted a few examples. Class ChallengesAssault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.Assault 2: Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.Support 2: Revive teammates as Support.Reduced from 200 revives to 60.Weapon AssignmentsAll weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle: Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.Mode & Unit AssignmentsThe majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.Conquest 2: Wins in Conquest.Reduced from 5 wins to 2.Conquest 3: Objective kills in a round of Conquest.Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.Gameplay & MasteryGeneral “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.Explosives Expert 2: Get Multi Kills (2+ Kills Onwards) with explosives.Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.Adaptable 2: Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500. REROLL CHALLENGES SYSTEMWe have also made adjustments to the reroll challenges system. When rerolling a challenge, it will prevent Battlefield 6 players from receiving a challenge that can only be completed in REDSEC. REDSEC players will continue to receive additional challenges that can be completed in REDSEC when rerolling. Which challenge you gain after rerolling will still be random. Our intent is to have clear and achievable goals where reward meets challenge. These challenges and assignments are meant to be achievable without significant time commitment, while some will require a bit of mastery and reward you for that. These changes are rooted in your feedback, so we hope that you’ll continue to share your constructive thoughts and concerns. You can report bugs on our EA Forums and join the community on the Battlefield Discord server. See you on the Battlefield. //The Battlefield Team This announcement may change as we listen to community feedback and continue developing and evolving our Live Service & Content.

2807960,Battlefield REDSEC - Gauntlet 101,"Survive and advance in Gauntlet: an all-new cutthroat, knockout-style elimination mode where squads race to complete missions.In Gauntlet, eight squads go head-to-head in a series of special missions that push every squad to their limit. Decryption, extraction, territory domination, target protection, explosive transport and more–only squads with the complete package will come out on top in this Gauntlet of elimination ending in a squad vs. squad showdown.Ready to run the Gauntlet? Assemble your squad and claim glory in this competitive experience.Gauntlet at its CoreGauntlet is a competitive, round-based mode based on a four-mission sequence :FIRST MISSION - Eight SquadsSECOND MISSION - Six SquadsTHIRD MISSION - Four SquadsFINAL MISSION - Two SquadsThe Combat Zone for each mission is based on sections of Fort Lyndon and is custom fit to the number of remaining squads, so that the First Mission has the largest Combat Zone and the Final Mission has the smallest. Its order of mission - namely the Second and Third Missions - can be skipped in specific circumstances, such as Multiple squads forfeiting the Gauntlet by leaving early.At the start of Season 1, there are eight mission types; one additional mission - Rodeo - will be added during Season 1, with more to follow in additional seasonal updates. Unlike Battle Royale, Classes in Gauntlet are the same as those in Battlefield 6 Multiplayer; if you are coming in from Battlefield 6 Multiplayer, your loadouts will carry over into Gauntlet.Specific missions may benefit from unconventional Class choices across the squad; rather than choosing the standard “Assault, Engineer, Support and Recon” balanced composition, you may find more success on double, tripling, or quadrupling up on a Class.ReassignmentNobody likes a quitter, especially if you are performing well in a Gauntlet despite them. When your Gauntlet team is eliminated due to teammates leaving, there is a chance that you will be assigned to a new Gauntlet team rather than be eliminated. Reassignment ensures all teams have four active players throughout the Gauntlet match, rewarding top performers from squads with teammates who leave mid-operation. At the end of each mission (save for the Final Mission), all squads, including eliminated squads, will be checked for open spots. If there is an open spot on a surviving squad, or if there is a unique scenario with open spots across multiple eliminated and surviving squads, then a Reassignment will occur, guaranteeing the next mission will have the correct number of squads. Full squads of four who advance to the next mission will not be reassigned.Gauntlet MissionsEvery Gauntlet “round” is a different mode or “mission” - with eight mission types and numerous Combat Zones, it is incredibly rare to have the exact same Gauntlet mission sequence in back-to-back matches with over 70,000 different possible combinations. However, prior to each mission, a miniature briefing takes place that details the rules of engagement and how points are scored.Every mission offers one point for every kill and revive. This means reviving a squadmate is technically a two point play, as it earns your squad one point while denying a point from the enemy. Keep this in mind when determining your strategy for success as well as Class choice, since the Support Class has multiple tools to help with revives.True to Battlefield’s core principles, however, the most effective point scoring method across all but one mission is to play the objective. Whether it is destroying M-COMS, holding consoles, or remaining on designated zones, objective play will rack up score faster than playing for a K/D ratio.Across all missions, points are doubled in the last minute of that mission. For example, if a mission normally rewards a squad one point per kill, then a squad will receive two points per kill during the last minute of the mission.Some missions will only appear in specific Gauntlet rounds. For example, “Heist” is only played as a Final mission between two squads and does not show up as a First, Second or Third mission.The eight available Gauntlet missions, as well as when they can appear in a Gauntlet, are as follows:Name1st Mission (8 Teams)2nd Mission (6 Teams)3rd Mission (4 Teams)Final Mission (2 Teams)Circuit✓✓✓✓Contract✓✓✓Deadlock✓✓✓✓Decryption✓✓✓✓Extraction✓✓✓Heist✓Vendetta✓✓✓Wreckage✓✓✓✓CircuitSquads earn points by simultaneously capturing and holding as many control consoles as possible. Think Domination, except you must actively capture each control console, the number of which varies by stage:FIRST MISSION - Up to 36 Control ConsolesSECOND MISSION - Up to 24 Control ConsolesTHIRD MISSION - Up to 12 Control ConsolesFINAL MISSION - Up to 5 Control ConsolesOne point is earned every 20 seconds for each console controlled.The Support Class and its wealth of revival and defensive Gadgets could be great to lean on in this fast-paced mission, or the Assault Class can shine through its abilities to c...",1761905525,

2807960,REDSEC New Player Guide,"You are now entering Battlefield: REDSEC.This free-to-play Battlefield* experience is open to all those who are not only interested in FPS Battle Royale games, but who also want to explore the high-octane team tactical competitive mode known as Gauntlet.If you are already familiar with Battle Royale and FPS games, then we advise reading the Battle Royale 101 and Gauntlet 101 guides, as they speak to core game mechanics, including differences that sets Battlefield REDSEC apart from the rest, and finer details. However, if you are unfamiliar with these video game genres and are completely new to Battlefield, then consider this your bootcamp:Battlefield in SummaryBefore understanding what REDSEC is, what is Battlefield?Since 2002, the Battlefield franchise is known for producing iconic all-out warfare FPS experiences, built on the concepts of tactical destruction - environments that react to your in-game actions and may help you gain an advantage - and high-intensity team-based combat. REDSEC is Battlefield’s first-ever “free-to-play Battle Royale” game, but it’s not just Battle Royale: this experience includes Gauntlet, a round-based elimination mode that samples from the franchise’s rich Multiplayer history, as well as REDSEC’s Portal Community Creations, an ever-evolving sandbox from our community developers.However, your first steps into REDSEC - or rather, your Initiation - will more than likely come in the form of the Battle Royale Initiation playlist:Battle Royale InitiationIn BR Duos, eliminate hostels, track intel, and dodge the chemical ring on a condensed map.Battle Royale Initiation is built for new players: in this Battle Royale variant, you and a squadmate can drop into a match with the following key differences:This version of Fort Lyndon is significantly smaller than its full version. Specifically, only the southeast portion of the map is accessible, with the Marina, Fleetview Ridge and Golf Course serving as the northern border, and the Defense Nexus as the western border.Players who can access this mode are limited to newer players.A 48 player maximum, inclusive of Bots.Essentially, this is a low-stakes learning environment to learn how Battle Royale is done the Battlefield way. Specifically, your path towards victory will involve the following:Dropping InChoose your Class, which comes with its own benefits such as Gadgets and a “Training Path” that grants passive traits as you and your squad perform in-game actions.ASSAULT - The ultimate frontline fighter, skilled at punching through enemy defenses. Dominate close to mid-range encounters and limit the enemy’s ability to fight.ENGINEER - The battlefield’s leading vehicle and equipment technician. Execute repairs to keep allies combat effective, or strike hostile armor with force to break their attack.SUPPORT - The backbone of any combat unit for defense and sustained fighting. Heal and resupply friendly forces, while fortifying defensive positions to keep them protected.RECON - The perfect intelligence and counterintelligence operative. Neutralize targets from a distance, or infiltrate, gathering intel and disrupting hostile forces.You also get to choose a Sidearm, a small personal defense weapon that is great in a pinch, but is not meant to carry you through an entire match. Next, get ready to parachute into Fort Lyndon! Either you or your duo will be labelled as the “Squad Leader;” when the Squad Leader calls for a jump, both of you will leap out of the infiltration plane.At any point, the non-Leader can “break away” from the formation and continue dropping on their own. However, we highly recommend that new players stay in formation. Your parachute will automatically deploy when you get close to the ground (unless you switch this Setting off, which we don’t recommend to new players). Alternatively, you can manually deploy the parachute to delay landing in favor of a more intentional landing spot, but remember that every second off the ground is another second for every enemy to start getting better weapons.Securing Better Weapons, Ammo and ArmorYour sidearm can only get you so far. That’s where scavenging for weapons, ammo and armor become the tools for survival.These are all available through a variety of crates found in the map; look for giant rectangular boxes that are green (Common), red-and-black (Rare), or red with Class symbols (Class Chests). Class Chests are the rarest of the trio, but often contain rewards that fit your chosen Class. Look for vehicles that can be opened to contain more items, as well as locked vaults that the Engineer Class can open with their Repair Tool.Crates can also contain Ammo, which is shared between all weapons in a given weapon category. For example, picking up Assault Rifle ammo will grant ammo to any and all Assault Rifles you use. While there are other ways to gain more ammo like picking it off eliminated enemies or getting an Ammo Resupply Call-In, the easiest way to restock is to use the Support Cl...",1761753583,

2807960,"Community Update - Introducing REDSEC: Battle Royale, Gauntlet, and Portal","Hey everyone,We are stoked to finally pull the curtain back on what we have been working on for a while. Word has spread about our version of Battle Royale, and players have been anticipating when they will be able to ride around in a golf cart. We’re excited to announce that Battlefield REDSEC is now live, alongside Battlefield 6 Season 1.Battlefield REDSEC is Battlefield’s free-to-play experience that you can drop into without owning the base game. Already own Battlefield 6? Squad up in REDSEC with your friends, whether they have Battlefield 6 or not.REDSEC delivers three ways to play:The Battle Royale Mode - The Battlefield WayGauntlet - An all-new, round-based elimination modePortal - Make and play custom experiences based on elements available in REDSECFort Lyndon: The Biggest Battlefield Map EverWelcome to Fort Lyndon - part SoCal beach community, part military blacksite, all battlefield. You’ll fight through urban city centers, dense military compounds, and once-idyllic suburban neighborhoods. This is our largest Battlefield map ever created, with secrets and intel waiting to be discovered.The Battle Royale Mode - The Battlefield WayHere’s a quick rundown of what you’ll need to know.Player count: 100 per match - 25 squads of 4 or 50 duos.Battlefield DNA, tuned for the Battle Royale mode:Core Battlefield classes are in play, but altered from Battlefield 6 to work within the context of Battle Royale. For example:Assault class retains the use of the ladder for vertical flanks from Battlefield 6. Their traits have been tweaked with benefits, including faster armor recharge, faster gadget regen, and more.Support class spawns with the ability to carry extra armor plates and ammo. They can rank up to providing full-health revives and boost the regen rate of nearby squadmates.Training Paths give each class unique abilities that unlock or upgrade gear.Locating hidden intel caches and completing missions are an efficient way to level up your training path. The higher the risk, the higher the rewards, including caches and access to combat vehicles.We evolved destruction to tactical destruction, turning it into a tool you can use to reshape the environment to your advantage. Breach walls, destroy buildings, and use rubble as cover.Battlefield isn’t Battlefield without vehicles capable of wreaking havoc on land, water, and air. Scattered across the map, you can find helicopters, boats, and even golf carts to ride to war in.Looting is a key part of any Battle Royale, and it’s no different here. Navigate throughout the map to find crates holding weapons, armor plates, ammo, and more. Search for your favorite loadout that will lead your squad to victory.Oh, and did we mention that we have the deadliest ring in BR already? We advise against testing how dangerous it actually is unless you’re willing to risk it all.We’ve already implemented player-driven changes and outlined what changes players can expect at launch from our Battlefield Labs play sessions. Read the details here and please keep the feedback coming as we continue to shape the game with you. If you want to learn more about the Battle Royale mode in detail, read up on our Battle Royale 101 blog here.GauntletWe wanted to bring something to the table that no one’s played in Battlefield before, so we built Gauntlet. It is structured as an elimination series where squads work together to score points by completing objectives, getting kills, and supporting one another across 4 randomized missions of vital importance to the operation in Fort Lyndon. Eight squads of four soldiers each enter, but only one will make it through all four missions. After every mission, the squads with the fewest points are eliminated from the match, with the top 3 earning bonus progress on their training paths to gain the upper hand in the next mission. Intensity rises as staying above the cut line becomes more and more difficult until the two best squads finally face off in one last mission to determine who will claim victory. If your squad is eliminated because teammates leave mid-operation, top performers can be reassigned to a surviving squad instead of leaving the game. At the end of each mission (except the Final Mission), reassignments may take place. The game will check for open slots and fill them so squads stay full and you can get back to gaming. There will be 8 different types of mission varieties at launch. Here’s a taste of what some of these missions will entail:Decryption: Squads compete to pick up and protect locator beacons while they transmit dataWreckage: Your squad needs to find, transport, and detonate bombs at hostile M-COMs scattered across the combat zone.Vendetta: Your squad needs to eliminate marked hostile High Value Targets and protect a High Value Target of your own.Circuit: Your squad earns points by capturing and defending control terminals; the larger the network, the more points you earn.Every Gauntlet match is different - mission draws, locations, an...",1761672669,

Scour the map to find loadout items, including weapons of various rarities and Upgrade Kits, or complete squad missions to unlock powerful rewards. You may even find a vehicle keycard that grants access to a heavy armored tank.We detail everything you need to know about Battle Royale in this guide here.REDSEC: GauntletReady to run the Gauntlet? This all-new cutthroat, knockout-style, fast-paced elimination experience pits squads against each other in a series of high-octane missions, some of which will be familiar to Battlefield Multiplayer veterans.In Gauntlet, eight squads go head-to-head in a series of special missions that push every squad to their limit. Decryption, extraction, territory domination, target protection, explosive transport and more–only squads with the complete package will come out on top in this Gauntlet of elimination ending in a squad vs. squad showdown.Every Gauntlet “round” is a different mode or “missions,” such as Deadlock, a multi-team variant of King of the Hill, or Wreckage, which is similar to Rush. With eight mission types and numerous Combat Zones, it is incredibly rare to have the exact same Gauntlet mission sequence in back-to-back matches. However, prior to each mission, a miniature briefing takes place that details the rules of engagement and how points are scored.At the end of each round, the bottom two teams in that mission are eliminated ...",1761669063,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_487176015_1761671128_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

2807960,Battlefield 6 - Community Update - Latest Changes and Preparing for Season 1,"Hello everyone,Thank you for continuing to share your experiences and for helping us shape Battlefield 6 together. As we approach the launch of Season 1, we want to share another update on the changes and improvements we’ve been working on based on your feedback. Priority Battlefield 6 Game UpdatesOur immediate focus is on overall performance and the combat experience. As we move forward we’re investigating potential changes on key areas such as weapon dispersion, balance, visibility, aim assist, progression, and more. A number of updates have already been made available and we have more that are planned to rollout over the course of Season 1. Live Now:Custom Search: We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed. Vehicle Spawn Bug: We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.Portal Server Availability: Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the details on how to get Full XP in Verified modes. Upcoming Changes:Player Movement: We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience. In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.Progression: We are continuing to monitor the impact of the changes that were made last week and already seeing a smoother experience as we roll into Season 1. Some additional areas we are tracking:XP earned in Escalation and King of the Hill is not always working as intended. We are planning to significantly increase the payout to bring them in line with other modes and will keep monitoring once the changes are live.We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates. Some examples of what we are currently considering are:Class Assignment - Assault 1 - Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector - 30 to 3Class Assignment - Engineer Expert 3 - Repair Vehicles in a Match - From 6000 to 1000Weapon Assignment - Deadeye 2 - Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles - from 150 to 5In addition, a later game update will reduce the 200m distanceVisibility: We are actively looking into adjustments to exposure and brightness. This will lead to improvements in places where players have experienced blinding light when looking outdoors, overly dark interiors when looking indoors, and a lack of visibility around weapon optics when zooming in. These adjustments are part of a wider pass focused on improving visibility that we expect to complete later in Season 1.Weapon Dispersion: As part of our Season 1 Update 1 (October 28), we’re making several adjustments to how weapon dispersion behaves. These changes are aimed at ensuring each weapon’s accuracy better reflects its intended performance over range. We’ve also fixed a bug that caused dispersion to not decrease as expected when transitioning from sprinting to a prone position.We’ll continue refining how weapon accuracy behaves in battle to make your shots feel more consistent and rewarding across all weapon types. Our upcoming tuning pass will reduce the overall impact of dispersion across multiple weapon types while keeping the core intent intact. Burst-firing will remain the most effective way to control a weapon, and each weapon will still perform best within its intended range. We’ve also identified a couple of bugs that caused weapons to feel less accurate than intended:Post-Sprint Firing: Weapons fired immediately after sprinting while zoomed could retain higher dispersion, reducing accuracy.Movement Start: Dispersion was increasing faster than it should when players began moving, making even small adjustments unexpectedly impac...",1761310829,
2807960,"Battlefield 6's XP farm crackdown is having all the right effects, and the dev just got even more ruthless","In the grand scheme of things, there really isn't that much to complain about with <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>. Especially when you compare it to its predecessor... It's a return to form for the series, and while there've been a couple of small pain points, you know as well as I do that constant grumbles surround even the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters"">best FPS games</a>. One such frustration involves XP farm servers, which were letting players zoom through weapon and attachment unlocks but were also cluttering Portal with samey, soulless, bot-farming experiences rather than unique, creative ones. Last week, Battlefield Studios' crackdown began by <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-6/update-progression-changes-conquest"">increasing the XP gained in regular game modes</a> to disincentivise XP farms, and starting to hide Portal experiences that were blatantly built for that purpose.

2807960,Community Update - Update on Community Servers and Portal Experiences,"Hello everyone,As we mentioned last week, we are in the process of addressing some known issues that are affecting Portal's Community tab and the availability of servers and experiences there. Update on Community Experiences Recently, we shared that we’re making changes to reduce the number of XP farm servers appearing in the Server Browser and Community Experiences. These servers have made it harder for players to discover the kinds of experiences Portal was created for. We have organized a series of changes to emphasize our commitment to highlighting the player community and making this a space where you can celebrate creativity, find unique experiences, play with friends, and build communities. As part of this effort, we’ve rolled out several backend updates to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal. This includes resolving unintended systems that affected XP progression and balance across experiences, and for now, removing bots from Verified Experiences to help improve the overall quality of matches. Further updates that were made today:Verified Experiences with “Bot Backfill” disabled continue to grant Full Progression and XP.Custom Experiences will continue earning reduced progression, regardless of whether bots are active. This keeps creative freedom and allows you to express yourself within Portal while maintaining progression balance. To pick up these changes properly and have an experience earn full XP, any qualifying experience would need to be unpublished, have “Bot Backfill” disabled, and then republished. Servers, including persistent ones, may occasionally need to be restarted. These brief interruptions may continue until ongoing improvements are fully implemented. At an initial glance, we’ve started to see a decline in PvE servers with fewer active players, while PvP servers, where players compete against one another, are becoming more active. PvE options are still available through Custom Experiences, but Verified Experiences with full XP are starting to better reflect our focus on player-versus-player gameplay. Also, we’re still exploring potential solutions that address current issues that would allow us to reintroduce bots in the future while continuing to deliver a great player experience.Regarding ChallengesWe wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that we have seen the discussion that these farming servers are necessary due to the difficulty of challenges or issues affecting them. We are actively working on updates for challenges and will share details as progress is made in this area.  What’s Next for Portal We believe the best Battlefield moments happen when players connect and compete in shared, player-driven experiences. The kind of experiences that capture the unpredictability, teamwork, and intense moments that define Battlefield. These updates will move us closer to that goal. We’ll continue to monitor, adjust, and refine Portal and Community Experiences as issues are resolved. At the same time, we want to recognize the incredible creativity and passion within the Portal community; it’s been truly inspiring. From faithful recreations of classic modes to completely original ideas, your imagination continues to impress us, and we’re committed to fostering that innovation moving forward.We have also seen a few questions about Verified Experiences and official servers. The “BattlefieldOfficial” servers are legitimate, official servers created and maintained by the Battlefield team. You’ll see them listed in the Server Browser under the BattlefieldOfficial or BFPortalOfficial account; both names refer to the same verified source.These servers host persistent, official Battlefield experiences, like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, with standard “vanilla” settings. Currently, multiple persistent servers are hosted under BattlefieldOfficial, so players can reliably find populated matches without needing to rely on bots or random matchmaking. We also maintain a variety of Verified Experiences, such as Hardcore, Infantry, and Closed Weapon variants, that appear in the Featured Experiences section or through the search function. These experiences are intended to rotate regularly to keep the gameplay fresh and reward full XP. How to Join BFPortalOfficial Experiences/Servers:Go to the Community tab in the main menu.Select an experience such as Hardcore Conquest.Click View More by Creator in the bottom left corner. From here, you can see all of the BFPortalOfficial modes and can choose a mode you and your friends want to play, like Hardcore Conquest.Browse or host a server, and share the name and host with friends so they can easily join you.Season 1 is Almost Here We have other updates and changes planned for Season 1 based on your feedback. We are actively finalizing these details to share with you, and thank you for your continued feedback. //The Battlefield Team This announcement may change as we listen to community feedback and continue developing and ev...",1761275022,

2807960,Portal 101: Playing and Hosting Portal Community Experiences,"Battlefield Portal is a massive sandbox where creators and players can push Battlefield to the limit. Now in its second iteration, Portal is available to all Battlefield 6 owners alongside the full Multiplayer experience and single-player Campaign.Unlike Multiplayer and Campaign, Portal Community Experiences are created by fellow Battlefield community members like you. In other words, it's our tools with your - and the community’s - rules.If you are ready to create your own Portal experience, then we suggest advancing to the Portal Builder guide here. Otherwise, if you need inspiration, or you rather play community creations first before creating your own, here’s how to get started:How to Play Portal - In-Game Experiences and Server BrowserThe easiest way to jump into a Battlefield 6 Portal Community Experiences is to look for the Community Category of the Main Menu, or by directly searching for the experience in the Community Experience Library on our website here.You can find the Community Category by booting up Battlefield 6 and entering its main menu, where you can also access Multiplayer and the Single Player Campaign. Scroll down or select the Community tab on the Main Menu to see a selection of Community Experiences; think of these as Portal’s “modes,” which can either be modified versions of traditional Multiplayer modes, such as Conquest and Domination, or completely unique ways to play Battlefield 6.What you see on this initial Portal screen are “Featured Community Experiences,” player-made creations curated by Battlefield developers based on the Experience’s exceptional creativity. If you want to search for more, then you can use the “Search” button to go through the in-game Community Experience Library.There are multiple ways to sort through the Community Experience Library, including by “Most Popular” or “Featured,” and you can also filter experiences by the following parameters: Tags: A collection of pre-defined words that automatically get applied to Community Experiences based on their settings.Maps & Modes: Allows you to see Community Experiences that are on an exact mode, such as Multiplayer offerings like Breakthrough or Custom modes, or a defined map or maps, such as Operation Firestorm and Siege of CairoSearch by Word: Find Community Experiences with a name of description containing the word you specify.Experience Code: Most helpful when you know the exact Community Experience you want to play. This string of characters is directly associated with one Community Experience; type that in here to find only that experience.If your search comes up empty, then that Community Experience hasn’t been created… Yet. That’s where you can come in to create it on your own, provided it can be made using Battlefield 6’s tools and follow our Community Guidelines!Another way to search for a Community Experience is by using the Server Browser; when in the “Search Experiences” menu, tab over to “Servers” to see this screen:You can use the sort and filter features to get the exact lobby you want to play in. Sorting works for properties like player count, map or ping (connection quality from your PC or console), while Filtering allows for specificity on host region, max players, tags and more.How to Play Portal - Hosting GamesPortal Community Experiences can also be hosted with no special network nor developer skills required.After selecting a Community Experience, select “Host” to reach another screen with several simple options; scroll down to see the following in order. First is the Server Name and Description; make sure these are as accurate as possible within the designated word count, as this will drive players to your server. Next are optional Welcome and Periodic Messages, which will appear when a player joins your server and periodically during the match respectively. The most complicated hosting steps are inputting a password and choosing to host a persistent server. A password is recommended if you want to play a Community Experience with friends only. Otherwise, anyone who searches for your hosted experience can join. As for persistent servers, this option allows players to still search for - and play - on your Community Experience server even if you are offline.Choosing Your Portal Experience - Full Progression vs. Limited ProgressionPlaying Portal grants XP and Progression opportunities just like any Multiplayer mode.

2807960,Battlefield 6 - Community Update - Player Progression and Portal Servers,"Hello everyone, It’s been an exciting first week for Battlefield 6, and we’re thrilled to have you with us as we embark on this journey together. We’ve been closely listening to your feedback and wanted to take a moment to address some of the initial concerns on progression and community experiences that we’ve seen from players around the world. Progression and XP AdjustmentsWe’ve heard your feedback around the pace of progression, especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets, and weapon attachments. We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield. As initial steps, we are working on the following changes to progression and how it feels as you play:The XP gained from match completion and the daily bonus are being increased by 10% and 40% respectively. The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you’ll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast.Please Note: For weapons that are already being progressed, the UI might display something abnormal at first, but this should resolve itself once a match is played while using that weapon.  The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively. While this allows these assignments to be started sooner, we are aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves and are actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes.Our goals here are to make the progression experience feel smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone like fully mastering a weapon. Regarding Community ExperiencesOver the past week, many of you noticed that we reached maximum capacity on community servers. After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it’s become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people. The Experiences in the Community section is a key part of what makes Battlefield 6 special. It’s meant to be a space for creativity, experimentation, and connection, where you can easily find and enjoy great modes with your friends and squadmates. Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas. We are developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences. Implementing this will require some maintenance on the backend. After the update is live, we expect all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server. Whether that’s Hardcore Conquest, All-Out Warfare, longer matches, or your favorite community-created experience, we want you to be able to find and enjoy it easily with your friends as you play your way together. More Updates Incoming We’re targeting these updates to go live within the next week, potentially sooner depending on testing and verification. We’ll provide updates on x.com/battlefieldcomm as these changes are deployed and we’ll be closely monitoring to ensure server stability is maintained as everyone jumps in to enjoy their favorite modes. We have also seen your concerns on other areas of the game, including visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more. We’ll share more details on these as updates are determined. Please continue sharing your thoughts on your platform of choice, as your feedback is helping us shape Battlefield 6 into the best experience it can be. This is just the start. As we prepare to go into Season 1 you can expect more adjustments as we continue fine-tuning gameplay, progression, and the experience based on your input. Thank you for being part of this community and we’ll see you out there on the Battlefield. //The Battlefield Team This announcement may change as we listen to community feedback and continue developing and evolving our Live Service & Content. We will always strive to keep our community as informed as possible.",1760691068,
