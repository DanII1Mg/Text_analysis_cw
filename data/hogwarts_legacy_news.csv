990080,Hogwarts Legacy Patch Notes - 01/30/2025,"Build Version – 1326194 Developer notes – This patch adds new Ray Tracing features and enhancements, DLSS4 support, Bug Fixes, and MODs support to the PC version of the game. Ray Tracing now has more toggles exposed for users to customize their experience. Previously, users could just turn RT features on and off, with a global RT Quality setting. We now expose quality settings for each feature, excluding RTAO, and an additional RT geometry quality. In addition to the following: All Raytraced Reflections are now rendered at a higher fidelity, resulting in crisper, more detailed visuals. Raytraced Reflections have been enabled on bodies of water, including the Black Lake. Additional settings have been exposed for the Raytracing feature on Hogwarts Legacy, allowing users to customize the visual experience to best suit their hardware. Previously Raytracing was simply enabled or disabled via a global quality setting. In the latest patch, we now expose quality settings for each feature (excluding Raytraced Ambient Occlusion). Raytracing Geometry settings have also been exposed; this allows users to adjust the render distance and realism of both Raytracing Shadows & Reflections. This affects the level of detail that the game renders raytraced geometry. Support for Nvidia’s DLSS4 has been added to the game. Support for Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction technology has been added to the game. RTX 50 series GPU owners can utilize Nvidia's Multi-Frame Generation technology. Another new addition is now Hogwarts Legacy’s MOD support on the PC. You now have the ability to play with Community MODs that have been added to our PC version of the game, adding MOD browsing and installation in our PC Client. We have also modified our game editor and made it available to the modding community on Epic Game Store, integrated with CurseForge MOD system, and spent some time improving the character, quests, and dungeon systems to make them more user friendly in the editor. This system will open the creativity of our community for our Hogwarts Legacy community. Playing with MODs: By linking a WB account, players can now install mods from the new MODs menu Link your account — WB Games Players can browse and discover new mods from the new mod browser, click “Play MODs” Players are able to create new saves and copy existing vanilla saves in order to play with MODs while keeping your vanilla save files safe. Create, Access, and Play MODs on the Enable MODs screen in “Play MODs” Players are able to assign a different mod configuration to different saves to allow mod experimentation Reminder that you need to be online for the MODs system to work properly MODs Creator Kit with Curseforge Integration Best Practices & Do’s and Don’ts Do use some form of source control to back up the contents of any mods that you are working on. When the Creator Kit is updated from the Epic Game Store, sometimes files that are not part of the official installation (such as a user’s mods) will be removed. Backing up your mod source in some form of source control will help you prevent lost work such as this. Don’t attempt to open the Creator Kit uproject directly (e.g. by double-clicking on it) - users should always launch from the Epic Game Store. Don’t change the activation state of any of the Creator Kit project’s plugins - it tends to break things. Don’t use non-alphanumeric characters in the names of assets (this includes whitespace characters) or database fields. This will likely cause problems and may prevent things from working as intended. In place of whitespace characters in names, use an underscore _ instead if needed. Don’t attempt to change the enabled / disabled state of any existing plugins in the Creator Kit. That will break things. Don’t attempt to add / remove any plugins from the Creator Kit. That will break things. Don’t force-delete Blueprints / other assets that are referenced by any mods you might be working on in the Creator Kit. Force-deleting in-use assets can lead to instability / crashes. Don’t attempt to create a new character from within the Creator Kit multiple times. Specifically, entering the avatar creator portion of the Root Level more than once per program run in the Creator Kit can cause the Creator Kit to get stuck, requiring the user to restart the Creator Kit. Do link your WB Account with Curseforge - Link your account — WB Games MODS FAQs - *Known Issue: PC Game Client Due to changes to both data serialization and upgrades to our Raytracing features in the Hogwarts Legacy engine, level code changes were made that will break all 3rd Party MODs that use skeletal mesh assets made before the upcoming MODs patch.
