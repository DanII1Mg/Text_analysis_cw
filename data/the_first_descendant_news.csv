(+30%)# Director’s CommentsGreetings, Descendants. This is the Director of The First Descendant, Minseok Joo. Following the recent update, we identified an issue where the Sprint speed of certain Descendants—specifically Hailey—was unintentionally matching that of Bunny. This occurred during the process of increasing Melee Weapon Sprint speeds and resulted in behavior that deviated from the Dev Team’s intentions, ultimately conflicting with our goal of preserving each Descendant’s unique identity. In this patch, we’ve adjusted the method used to increase Melee Weapon Sprint speed so that only Bunny can reach a Sprint speed of 1600 through her skills, as originally designed. Melee Weapon Sprint speed will continue to follow the previous baseline of 1040, but Hailey will now only be able to reach up to 1440 when using her skills. We kindly ask for your understanding, as this change may affect your gameplay experience. We also addressed an issue where Harris’s skill, “Waste Disposal,” was providing an abnormally high amount of DEF.We sincerely apologize for the confusion this unexpected bug may have caused. To apologize for the inconvenience, we have prepared compensation consisting of a Crystallization Catalyst and a set of five Boosts. Please understand that these adjustments were made to clarify the individuality and balance of each Descendant.We will continue to monitor all Descendants to ensure they maintain their unique strengths, and we remain committed to delivering more stable and reliable updates moving forward.Distribution DateCompensation Details11.12.2025 (Wed) 23:00 –11.19.2025 (Wed) 22:59 PST※ The Mail Expiration Date is 11.26.2025 (Wed) 22:59 PST.

2074920,Notice on Individual Skin Quality and Future Plans,"Greetings, Descendants. This is Minseok Joo, Director of The First Descendant. We have thoroughly reviewed all feedback regarding the quality of the Halloween skins. We sincerely empathize with your concerns, and based on this feedback, we have reoriented our approach for individual skins being prepared from 2026 onward to ensure that each Descendant has a clear and distinct identity. \   However, since skin production—from design to implementation and release—requires several months or more, the new direction could not be applied to the Halloween skins or some that are already in production. We sincerely apologize to those who may have felt disappointed by this. The entire Dev Team has reviewed the feedback provided regarding the individual skins currently being released. As a result, we have decided that the previously revealed “Cleaning Service” and “Medical Support” skins, introduced during the recent Dev Live, will not be sold as paid products. Instead, they will be made available through various future events and other in-game activities. We will provide a separate announcement regarding their release schedule at a later date. Moving forward, we will thoroughly prepare individual skins to ensure both distinctiveness and quality for each skin. However, as the number of Descendants increases, it is becoming increasingly difficult to create individual skins for all Descendants simultaneously. Therefore, we plan to rotate Descendants for each individual skin theme going forward. However, when there are major season updates, we plan to release skins for all Descendants together. Of course, we will continue to release universal skins as well. Beyond skins, we are reviewing all the feedback from the community following the October update. We are currently establishing mid-to-long-term development plans to address The First Descendant's shortcomings and improve its overall quality, and plan to share more information through a separate announcement once preparations are complete. The Dev Team will continue to steadily improve the game's quality and address content shortage issues. We are deeply grateful for your continued support and love for The First Descendant. The decision to make the aforementioned skins available as event rewards reflects our sincere desire to give back to our dedicated Descendants. The Dev Team remains committed to delivering a better game experience. Thank you once again to all who stand with us on this journey.",1761202887,

2074920,Apology and Compensation Announcement for Issues After Season 3 Update,"Greetings Descendants. This is The First Descendant Producer Beom-jun Lee. I would like to sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment you experienced due to the recurring issues during the recent Season 3 update. Through today’s announcement, I would like to address the issues related to the ""Battle Pass"" and ""Wall Crasher"" content. First, regarding the ""Battle Pass,"" there were continuous errors such as Weekly Challenges not refreshing and abnormal Daily Challenge EXP gains, which directly affected our Descendants' achievements and rewards. This issue arose during our response to Battle Pass errors after the 1.3.1 patch, and it was caused by inadequate handling by the Dev Team and an insufficient QA process. As the person in charge, I would like to apologize once again. We would like to assure you that we are continuously working to resolve the remaining issues. Next, regarding the highly anticipated ""Wall Crasher,"" we identified issues with reward drops at the beginning of the season, as well as unintended gameplay that exploited the party play function. We are currently preparing improvements for these issues. We also humbly accept the feedback that Season 3 content as a whole has not met expectations in terms of stability and completeness. The Dev Team will do their utmost to address the remaining issues with urgency while ensuring the previously announced monthly update plans continue without delay. In addition, the Dev Team aims to pursue more fundamental and sustainable improvements by learning from the issues that have emerged this season. Above all, we plan to establish a more stable development environment by reorganizing inefficient internal processes that have accumulated since launch. Not only will we make short-term efforts to prevent issues through more thorough inspections, but also, in the mid- to long-term, plan to comprehensively review and address problems within our inefficient development processes that have accumulated over time. Through these efforts, we will do our best to develop faster and more stable response capabilities to provide updates that will better satisfy our Descendants. While it may not fully make up for the disappointment our Descendants have felt regarding these issues, we have prepared the following compensation as a token of our sincerest apologies. ■ Compensation- Rewards will be delivered to your mailbox within approximately 10 minutes of logging in on the distribution date specified below.ㄴ The Battle Pass EXP compensation will not be delivered through the Mailbox but will be automatically applied upon login. If it is not correctly applied, please try logging in again.- The Mail Expiration Date is 09.10.2025 (Wed) 23:59 PDT. Please make sure to claim your rewards before expiration.Distribution DateCompensation Details08.21.2025 (Thu) 00:00 PDT -09.04.2025 (Thu) Before Maintenance2,400,000 Battle Pass EXP (Approx.

2074920,Our Sincere Apologies for the TikTok Advertising Issue,"Greetings, Descendants. We would like to sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment caused by the recent issue regarding the TikTok Creative Challenge. The TikTok Creative Challenge is a program where TikTok creators voluntarily produce and submit content that may be used as advertisements. After confirming with TikTok, we learned that no system currently exists to verify potential copyright infringement, and TikTok is now conducting further investigations to identify any additional cases.One confirmed case involved unauthorized use of DanieltheDemon’s content by another creator. TikTok identified this as a violation of its guidelines and has already blocked the creator’s account. We would also like to clarify that we do not upload creator advertisement videos as regular posts on The First Descendant’s official TikTok account. Creator advertisement videos are displayed when users access The First Descendant’s official account through advertisements.In contrast, if the official account is directly searched and visited, these creator advertisement videos are not displayed. This feature was newly implemented by TikTok on August 15 (Friday), and therefore these videos may have appeared as if they were posted and then deleted, but that is not the case. We are taking the TikTok advertisement issue very seriously, recognizing that we failed to uphold the authenticity of our marketing content and to respect the efforts of our creators and community. As a result, we will strengthen our advertising and marketing review processes, including additional review steps with our development team, to ensure that such issues do not recur. We are committed to thoroughly improving our review practices. We will also be committed to continuously being more transparent and responsible to regain the trust of our community and creators.Once again, we deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this incident has caused. Thank you for your understanding.",1755602156,

Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts.   We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice.   Thank you for your patience and understanding. ",1755506407,

Each one features an AI streamer rambling about the new boss Wall Crasher and maybe the Nier: Automata crossover while doing an odd headbob that I assume is supposed to make their rubber faces look more excited and emphatic.
