Vanguard Relics are available for Aya containing the Blueprints for the Warframes listed. These new Relics were created specifically for this event to offer players a chance to earn all six Prime Warframes.

Note: Caliban Prime and Protea Prime were both recently available via Prime Access and have not yet been vaulted.

Uriel incinerates foes with searing brimstone, and commands three fiendish summons to do his devil’s work. Ability 1: Infernalis Manifest an aura of flames inflicting Heat Damage and Status Effect on nearby enemies. Tap Dodge to take flight as a flaming meteor of destruction. Ability 2: Remedium Uriel heals himself and his demons. If his demons are dead, they are resurrected. Ability 3: Demonium Uriel rips out the souls of his demons, draining some of their health, and sends them in search of new victims. Souls explode on contact with an enemy, inflicting Damage Vulnerability. Ability 4: Brimstone Uriel and his demons create a growing ring of flaming brimstone. Damage inflicted increases with each consecutive hit. Passive Uriel commands, empowers, and protects three unique demons: CATENACH: Snares and slows enemies chaining them together. Damage dealt to the last enemy in the chain is inflicted on all snared enemies. (Unlocks with Infernalis) GULPHAGOR: Latches onto foes dealing damage over time. If killed, a circle of pain is spawned. (Unlocks with Remedium) VYTHELAS: Inscribes demonic runes upon fallen foes that add Fire Rate and Heat Damage when collected.

230410,TennoGen Celebrates the Stories of Its Creators,"It's been 10 years since Digital Extremes started the TennoGen program, allowing independent artists to create unique Customizations for your favorite Warframes. These community artists bring unique concepts and viewpoints to life, while your Fashion Frame shines even brighter thanks to TennoGen creators. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4437469/b353698f365e0fec69fe1a44a127a0815e59a1ce.jpg Hundreds of designs are made by these artists, carefully reviewed by Digital Extremes’ internal art department before their inclusion in the game. Once their work is released through the TennoGen program, artists are paid for their accepted items. That means your purchases can literally be life-changing for these fantastic community artists. Here are a few stories of success that creators have found thanks to your support of the TennoGen program. Goosmo {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4437469/3c55c6b961ea9bbc015d1c3bee21f8e98c53aa42.png TennoGen creations can be the first step on a larger path for certain creators. For Oliver Thanh An Vu, also known as Goosmo, it's been the door that's allowed him entry into the wider gaming industry. He's currently an apprentice 3D Artist at Bitfire Games, honing his craft and pushing his passions forward. Goosmo has always been a builder and creator, even from a young age, moving from Lego to Minecraft and then to robust 3D tools like ZBrush and Blender. He's also been a Warframe player since Open Beta, but it was a simple livestream that convinced Goosmo to make the jump to TennoGen. ""I saw Mike Skyers sculpt the first Valkyr Deluxe Skin live on stream,"" Goosmo told us. ""I think that was the first thing that really piqued my interest in TennoGen. So I just said 'screw it,' got my hands on ZBrush and tried sculpting. The learning curve was steep, but well worth it."" His first item in the TennoGen program was the Revenant Draugen Skin, but one of his favorite featured creations is the Gauss Nitrolyst Skin. Continuing to submit to TennoGen has helped Goosmo hone his craft and enhance his portfolio, landing him an apprenticeship at Bitfire Games. ""I always wanted to work in the game industry, I just wasn't really sure what kind of position it would be, or if it was even possible since the industry is small in Denmark. It was TennoGen that made me realize it had to be a 3D artist position and that it was possible at all,"" he said. Led2012 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4437469/cdf8eed1ff41e7385ad1f5353d83156c1c6fddc6.png Another creator who has seen success through the TennoGen program is Filipino artist Lendel Fajardo, also known as Led2012. Fajardo submitted an entry into the first Warframe TennoGen Contest at Polycount back in 2015. ""Everything changed due to that one Polycount x Warframe TennoGen 'test round' almost 10 years ago,"" he told us. Despite not having a winning entry, he caught the TennoGen bug and released his first Customization several months later. Since then, Fajardo has released more than 30 TennoGen Customizations, including the Protea Kollapsar Skin, the Baruuk Zamariu Skin, and the recently-released Xikonos Syandana. He's been able to use that TennoGen revenue to support his family and local community. He previously paid for his sister's college education, purchased food for families during the pandemic and currently funds his younger brother's university tuition. ""My sister has her own family now, along with her one year old baby,"" he explained. ""I still have one sibling that I'm funding and sending to college. Two more years and I'm done sending siblings to school."" Rekkou {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4437469/5e85438b06b58c14a60f20927f2c94fe2272c2ad.png Rekkou is one of the earlier participants in the TennoGen program, with his first accepted Customization — the Volt Arrester Helmet — appearing in the original TennoGen x Polycount Workshop Contest. His first item is also still his favorite TennoGen creation. ""Because it was for a contest, there's this pressure of making something that everyone will like to increase the chance of it being picked,"" said Rekkou. ""But I decided to just ignore that and make something I personally liked by combining various mecha designs I enjoyed. When it was chosen as one of the winners, I felt very validated."" Rekkou has enjoyed a long career as a TennoGen creator, with excellent past Customizations including the Gauss Agito Skin, the Volt Zener Skin and the Trinity Knightess Skin. His efforts have ultimately paid off in allowing him to start his own business in Japan. ""Right now, I'm opening my own 3D printing business that specializes in Airsoft equipment and garage kits,"" said Rekkou. ""It is thanks to TennoGen’s passive income that I'm able to open my own company in Japan and comfortably chase my dream of living here."" LostEpoch {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4437469/c9b1f65d3a64df983a6b8bd4ad7419e5cd9483b0.png For some creators, TennoGen is a way to fully express their creative impulses.

In many ways, our newfound friendship felt akin to the ones I'd formed in <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong> with Astarion, Lae'zel, and my beloved Shadowheart: a chance meeting that changed, in BG3's case, the course of history, and in our case, the general vibe of our interview (and potentially history, too). It's a relationship that you never quite have with the narrator of Faerûn's greatest tale to date; she's a faceless whisper, tempting and dissuading in her own way. She isn't a visible entity like Karlach, Wyll, and company, but she is still a character in her own right. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/1999-amelia-tyler-interview-baldurs-gate-3-narrator"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/luality-karlach-interview"">I met the BG3 streamer who played fetch with Karlach's head, and she's not sorry</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/hotfix-update"">New Baldur's Gate 3 update stops Dark Urge spilling all their secrets too early</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/mods"">The best Baldur's Gate 3 mods</a> ",1754670961,

Then, I heard we're returning to Duviri to chase after 1999's much-beloved Major Rosalka, and decided that it was time to put my fears aside and dive back into the weird, fantasy-inspired world that introduced me to Warframe in the first place. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/isleweaver-update"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/codes"">Warframe codes June 2025 and how to redeem</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/twitch-drops"">Warframe Twitch drops and how to claim</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/new-players"">Warframe is being massively overhauled to help welcome in new players</a> ",1750871475,

230410,Isleweaver Update Will Take Warframe Players Back To Duviri This June,"This past weekend at PAX East, Digital Extremes revealed <em>Isleweaver</em>, the next narrative chapter in <em>Warframe</em> after the wildly successful <em>1999</em> saga—and it’s coming sooner than you might think, Tenno. Though the new update will move away from the now-familiar streets of Höllvania, players will be exploring a new side of another infamous location: Duviri. After completing <em>1999</em>, players can embark on the new <em>Isleweaver</em> questline within the Duviri Spiral, playable exclusively in Warframe form. It seems Major Neci Rusalka, once a thorn in the Hex’s side, has somehow usurped Dominus Thrax’s throne; as punishment for the player having taken Höllvania from her, she now seeks to take Duviri from them in revenge. A new Clan Operation, Eight Claw, will launch alongside <em>Isleweaver</em> as a time-limited event (though the node will persist on the map afterward). Among the rewards are new cosmetics, a new secret weapon, and farmable pathos clamps.

Isleweaver - Coming June 2025 Let’s talk about our upcoming June update—Isleweaver!. To play Isleweaver, the player must have completed The Hex Quest. Isleweaver has the Tenno return to Duviri to tackle a new permanent node! A certain “she-devil” has returned. Major Rusalka has turned up in Duviri alongside a Murmur armada, claiming a stake to the ethereal realm. The Drifter caused havoc in her world, now she’s looking to settle the score. Rusalka’s invasion into Duviri has left Dominus Thrax himself retreating into the Undercroft and our Dormizone, and revealed long-standing secrets lurking in this emotionally-torn dimension. With Isleweaver, a new permanent node opens up in Duviri, where your Warframe will face off against the Murmur and engage in classic Duviri gameplay—that’s right, Drifter, time to take a backseat. Rebecca Ford gives us the rundown here! Our Principal Writer, Kat Kingsley, spoke more about Rusalka's return and what their presence means for the fate of Duviri and the Indifference. Oraxia Our 61st Warframe—ORAXIA! Seek out weakened prey to siphon them for Health and Energy, ensnare your enemies in webs, summon spiderlings, and climb along walls only like a spider can, offering a fresh form of mobility in Warframe.
