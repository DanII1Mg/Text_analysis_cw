One a day, every day of the year, perhaps for all time.</em> <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/a-story-about-my-uncle/"">A Story About My Uncle</a> is a non-combat, narrative-leaning platformer from the same folks responsible for Goat Simulator. It tells a whimsical tale about a boy, his nomad and currently missing uncle, a fantasy realm, and jumping. Lots and lots of jumping. &#8230; ",1474641055,
278360,Patch Notes for Build 3717,"Ice Cave Changes! In this patch we have addressed something that a lot of you have been asking for – changes to the stalactite corridor in the Ice caves. The stalactite corridor now has two lit platforms to stopover on, giving you easier ways to refill your grapple amount and a total of 3 rocket boots charges while navigating through the section. This should make it a little bit easier to get through, without taking away the challenge from those who wants it. Localizations Since we want to bring out languages with a faster pace, we have opted to bring out a few languages in a Beta stage every patch. The quality of the implementation may vary a lot (such as characters missing or subtitles acting strange), but we hope that this can help us plan and prioritize better for the upcoming patches. This patch it is time for Spanish and Portuguese to get added in their Beta stage. If you want to help out, head over to our Crowdin page! The translations over at Crowdin have also been updated, and now have strings for Credits and the Workshop monitor. Translations for these will be added in an upcoming patch. Some small touch ups We’ve also added a feature some of you have been requesting regarding screenshots and the hand getting in the way of them. You can now create a keybind for hiding/showing everything that might be in the way of your fantastic screenshots. To bind this to a key, open ASAMUInput.ini (located in C:\Users\ \Documents\My Games\A Story About My Uncle\ASAMU\Config), and follow the example below. Also, to maximize the quality of your screenshots, you can use the “TiledShot” command, which can capture screenshots at ridiculous resolutions. Bindings=(Name=""Escape"",Command=""CloseEditorViewport | onrelease ShowMenu"") Bindings=(Name=""F3"",Command=""ToggleScreenShotMode"") Bindings=(Name=""F4"",Command=""TiledShot 4"") Bindings=(Name=""F7"",Command=""GBA_QuickLoad"") Name is the key you want to bind, F3 and F4 in the example above, now you can just press those keys and take really awesome screenshots.

This time we have some good news for our non-english speaking adventurers, as we are now rolling out the game in other languages! == ASAMU is now available in other languages! == It’s been in the works for some time but the road has been rocky to say the least. However, we now have the first four translations up and ready to go. These are: French, German, Italian and Polish. Note that this is only for menus and subtitles, not the voiceovers. If your native tongue is not among these, don’t despair. We have more translations in store for you and we will be updating the game with these in the coming months. Maybe one day ASAMU will feature every language known to man.
