Check our post here for details on prizes and how to participate. In the meantime have a look at the highlights of the race in today's news post on the Path of Exile website here! ",1763590047,
238960,Keepers of the Flame Build Showcase,"Today, we will be showcasing some neat builds from Keepers of the Flame. Whether it’s something new or something powerful, we hope these builds inspire you. This is just a brief overview, so if you want to learn more about any of them, check out the links to the creators! Jorgen’s Spectral Helix Gladiator First up, we have a Spectral Helix Gladiator created by Jorgen, a build with an unreasonable amount of health that lets you face-tank Uber bosses with ease. To get these defenses, he utilises the new Aul Bloodline Ascendancy's Precursor's Release, so that you cannot be stunned, take no extra damage from critical strikes, and cannot be slowed if you have no socketed gems in your helmet, gloves, and boots. For health, they changed the colours of the empty sockets to red so they can use The Untouched Soul Amulet for a significant increase in maximum life. Then, they also use The Apostate armour, complemented by Warlock Gloves and Boots, to turn maximum Energy Shield to maximum Life. Of course, with such a ridiculous health pool we might wonder if we can turn it into damage scaling. Jorgen has done just that by using the Grey Wind Spectral Axe, which adds fire damage equal to 12% of the player's maximum life, and Rathpith Globe Shield to increase spell damage per 100 player maximum life. Lolcohol’s Kinetic Fusillade Elementalist There’s a new skill in 3.27 and it’s Kinetic Fusillade, a hovering kinetic projectile that can shoot like a machine gun if you know how to tweak it. In this build, Lolcohol is going to show us how. To reduce the base duration before the projectile is fired, they used Timeclasp Ring, Warped Timepiece Amulet and Less Duration Gem. For further duration reduction, they recommend anointing your amulet with the Window of Opportunity or Hasty Demise passive. They are able to reduce the duration from 0.7 seconds to 0.07 seconds in this build! Even though it looks simple, they have some additional tips to make sure that you can utilise the speed without sacrificing the damage in his video guide here. GhazzyTV’s Dark Pact Necromancer In this video, GhazzyTV is going to show us a budget friendly build utilising the new Bloodline Ascendancy supporting minion skills. This build uses two button rotations between Summon Skeleton and Dark Pact that will chain between the Skeleton and bring it to the enemy. With Catarina’s Bloodline, it can increase our damage and the health of our minions so the Dark Pact can sustain longer. PhazePlay’s Bleed Slam of Earthshaking Slayer Our final build today is a fantastic mapper build with enormous damage. With the transfigured version of Ground Slam, it can provide screenwide coverage! For a Bleed Slam build, they use Static Strike and Vulnerability to aggravate bleeding, then Rallying Cry for a damage buff. After that, spam your slam to get the bleed rolling. If you’re still struggling to find Ground Slam of Earthshaking, you can swap to Sunder which is also good for penetrating Hive Fortress defenses. For gear, they use Ryslatha’s Coil to gain life leech and Haemophilia to increase damage against Bleeding enemies. They also use a Spiking Uulgraft to increase the chance of bleeding. A simple straightforward build for those that want to try a high damage Ground Slam build this league. Thanks to all Exiles out there creating exciting and unique builds, and in particular those Exiles we've highlighted in this news post!",1763503596,

Check out a preview of the patch notes below. Keepers League Improvements and Fixes Added over 80 new Foulborn Unique items to discover. Increased the amount of Graftblood and Wombgifts you get back from Breach Hive encounters in areas. The buffs are most prominent in higher level areas with up to 50% more Graftblood in level 83 Maps. Hive Fortresses grant up to 25% more Graftblood in level 83 Maps. Fortresses grant up to 25% more Graftblood in level 83 Maps. Growing Wombgift now require 40% less Graftblood to grow on the Genesis Tree. Increased the number of monster packs that spawn each wave in regular Breach Hive encounters in Maps, up to 80% more packs in level 83 Maps. Increased the breakable Hive pack spawners by 40% in Maps. Slightly increased the number of Breach monster packs spawned within a Breach Hive. Slightly increased the number of Skill objects granted by Ailith in Breach Hive encounters in Maps. Slaying It that was Esh and It that was Tul will now grant players Graftblood. In Breach Hive encounters, destroying a burnable Hive pack spawner will now release a wave of purple flame destroying all walls within a 7.5 metre radius. The wave can chain react causing any other spawner objects burnt to release additional waves. Added a variety of obstructions to the centre of Hive Fortress encounters to channel monster paths. You can now vendor five Wombgifts to receive a random Wombgift in return. The Genesis Tree will now show a confirmation prompt if you have pending changes when closing it. Fixed the flame aura that burns Breach Hive walls having a visual radius lower than the actual burn radius. Fixed an issue where Wombgifts could not be filtered by Item Level in Item Filters. General Improvements Scarab changes: Scarab of Divinity now has a limit of 3, from 2, and causes Up to 3 additional Rare Monsters in Area to be Pantheon-Touched, from 2. Titanic Scarab of Legend causes unique monsters in area to have 4 additional modifiers, from 2 Allflame Ember of Propagation now substitutes approximately 50% more monster packs in area. Legion Monsters broken out in areas affected by Legion Scarab of Eternal Conflict gain approximately 30% higher reward for each time they are broken out. Monsters from Abysses in areas affected by Abyss Scarab of Profound Depth now have approximately 30% higher reward for each prior pit in the Abyss they spawn from. Torment Scarab of Possession now has a limit of 3, from 4, and causes Rare Monsters in Area to have a quarter chance to be Possessed by up to 3 tormented spirits, from 1. Torment Scarab now has Tormented Spirits in Area have a 50% chance to be set free when Possessed Monsters are slain, from 25% Horned Scarab of Nemeses now has a limit of 2, from 1. Horned Scarab of Bloodlines now causes Magic Monsters in area to have an additional Modifier. This is in addition to previous behaviour. Beyond Scarab of Haemophilia now grants """"Characters that Kill Beyond Rare Monsters in Area have a 30% chance to gain their Modifiers for 20 seconds"""". This is in addition to previous behaviour. Unique items added to the core game in 3.27.0 can now be selected for Voidborn Reliquary and Valdo's Puzzle Box submissions. Stackable items will no longer be merged into existing item stacks when ctrl-clicking items into Market Stash Tabs. Fixed a bug where Avoidance and Attributes crafting recipe was missing from the Maelström of Chaos Unique Map Draconarius Wilhelm Flamebrand's fireball strike now deals 45% less Damage. Forest Warrior's Cyclone now deals 37.5% less Damage. Lowered the damage of Lightning Arrow by 37.5% on several monsters that use the skill. Bug Fixes Fixed a bug where Fortify Mastery '2% reduced Duration of Ailments inflicted on you per Fortification' did not apply to Bleed/Poison on you and instead affected your Bleed/Poison duration on enemies. Fixed a bug where Replica Dragonfang's Flight could generate with a blank gem entry. These amulets were attempting to grant +3 levels to ""Null"" gem, thereby doing nothing. These amulets now instead grant +3 levels to Kinetic Fusillade. Fixed a bug where the experience progression of Kinetic Rain and Kinetic Rain of Impact was incorrectly set to that of a gem starting at required level 12 and not 28. Fixed a bug where using currency in maps, such as on Strongboxes and Essences, could use currency from your Map Device Rucksack. Omen of Amelioration and Omen of Bequeathal are no longer consumed on death in situations where you would not lose experience for dying. Fixed a bug where effects from the player that converted monster Physical Damage to an element were also increasing the amount of damage from that element based on the percentage of Physical Damage converted and the monster's level. This would have affected Elementalist...",1762985453,

How to Join At the character selection screen, there's a panel below your characters which will list the events available. You can join the event by clicking 'join'. This option becomes available 30 minutes before the event is set to begin. Your character won't be able to move until the event starts. Rules If there are operational problems with the event (like significant realm stability issues at launch), Grinding Gear Games may restart the event at any point. The way we will do this is to create a new event league and indicate that players who wish to compete in the new event must make new characters there. Placings and prize eligibility are entirely at the discretion of Grinding Gear Games. While the event being SSF reduces a lot of scope for outside help, any form of account sharing (or other breaches of the Terms of Use) will disqualify a player from receiving prizes. Grinding Gear Games Employees (past or present) are not eligible for prizes. Players who have played on the Alpha realm (when the expansion was first deployed) are not eligible for prizes. Dying or migrating your character out of the league doesn't remove prize eligibility as long as the kill occurred while in the league. Good luck in the event!",1762734689,
238960,Keepers of the Flame - What We’re Working On,"It’s been almost a week since the launch of Keepers of the Flame, and our team continues to monitor community feedback. Over the past few days, we’ve deployed several hotfixes and a patch to address some of the issues players have been experiencing. In this news post, we’d like to outline what we’re currently working on. We are re-assessing the rewards from Breach monsters in map areas with an eye towards making the league mechanic encounters more rewarding directly, and thus more worth the time to engage with. We’re aware of the feedback regarding Hive encounters, with players frustrated by having to spend too much time destroying walls before the encounter. We’re investigating an option to allow a large number of walls to be destroyed at the start of the encounter. We have another batch of Foulborn uniques which didn’t quite make it into launch and will be going in with the next restart patch. Outside of Breach-specific changes, we are aware of feedback from players that late endgame farming strategies are currently lacking in diversity and progression. We are putting together a list of adjustments to address this, with an emphasis on making currently underperforming strategies more competitive. We are targeting next week for the release of these changes. A larger amount of changes to this area are planned for 3.28. We plan to deploy some of these changes, along with additional fixes and improvements, next week. Keep an eye out on the news for the full list of changes. Thank you for your continued feedback!

238960,What We're Working On,"The launch of Path of Exile: Keepers of the Flame over the weekend was one of our smoothest launches ever. Thanks to everyone who logged in to try it out! Since the initial 3.27.0 patch, we've made seven hotfixes which addressed a variety of bug fixes, crashes, and balance changes to the new Breach mechanic. There are additional hotfixes already in the pipeline to address bugs such as the old Breach mechanic still being available in the Temple of Atzoatl, and further balance changes to the new Breach mechanic. Hive Fortress encounters will soon be receiving some changes to make them easier to complete and less punishing if you fail. Ailith will create skills more frequently during Hive Fortress encounters. Note there is a maximum of 6 skill objects active at a time. Increased the internal cooldown for which Ailith can be damaged. This cooldown becomes longer the more damage she takes from an individual hit. This should help mitigate Ailith being bursted down in a few seconds. Failing a Hive or Hive Fortress encounter will now drop all the loot of the monsters you had killed up to that point. However, you will not gain any Graftblood or Wombgifts.

238960,Keepers of the Flame FAQ,"Following the Keepers of the Flame Content Reveal last week, we've seen a lot of questions about this update to Path of Exile. Check out the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions below. What is happening with content that is tied to Breach? Breachstones will still work in standard, but are unobtainable in Keepers Leagues. Breach Scarabs will be unavailable in the Keepers league. Chayula on Maven’s Invitation: The Feared has been replaced with the Incarnation of Ignorance. Maven’s Invitation: The Hidden is now replaced with The Remembered, requiring Witness of Courtyard of Wasting, Chambers of Impurity and Theatre of Lies. It That Fled does not appear in Betrayal encounters in Keepers Leagues. Will the identification of items use the Ctrl+Click shortcut from Path of Exile 2? The quick shortcut for item identification is Ctrl+Alt+Click on Mouse and Keyboard. Can all uniques be Foulborn? Not all uniques can be Foulborn, the list of uniques that can be is still ongoing however there will be more than one hundred. Uniques that come from specific sources, such as boss uniques cannot be Foulborn. Have there been any changes made to the frequency of finding Aul in Delve? The frequency of Aul appearing in Delve is unchanged. Will Faustus in the Rogue harbour also be able to manage asynchronous trade? Faustus asynchronous trade will only be available in hideouts. Will we be able to change our Bloodline ascendancy and how? Yes, you can respec your current Bloodline ascendancy with another for free (after defeating a relevant boss). Otherwise, you can use Orbs of Regret or gold to respec those points like normal ascendancy points (5 refund points each). Can multiple party members all get the same Bloodline ascendancy from the same boss? Yes, assuming they are in the fight when the boss is killed. Will Windburst Support work with movement from things like Flame Dash or Flicker Strike? Yes. It counts movement from travel skills as well as regular movement. Will graft skills scale off my damage and am I able to die from my graft skills reflected damage? Graft skills do not scale off of player stats, but do have affixes which will affect their skills in many ways. Since graft damage is not dealt by the player, reflected damage will not be dealt back to the player from graft skill use. How many Spectral Tigers can you have and how much Critical Chance, Attack and Cast Speed do they give? You can have up to 5 of them and each of them grants 25% Increased Critical Chance, 7% Increased Attack Speed and 7% Increased Cast Speed. We’ll continue to monitor for questions and will continue to update this post when we do. Thank you so much for your continued support, we'll see you at launch! ",1761609617,

The new seasonal league, Keepers of the Flame, is the first time developer Grinding Gear Games has delivered a direct sequel to one of its old mechanics, and it's picked a big one. Breach, which first appeared in 2016, is a simple but satisfying stalwart that was one of the systems hand-picked to make the jump to side-by-side sequel Path of Exile 2.

While public attention has certainly been more focused on PoE 2 since its early-access launch, there are a lot of reasons to care about its continuing predecessor. The first game is much more substantial, with a decade-plus of love and development from Grinding Gear Games honing it into one of the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-rpgs-pc"">best RPGs</a> on PC today - and you can play it for free.

238960,Secrets of the Atlas Second Boss Kill Event,"Next Thursday, July 24th at 1 PM PDT, we’ll be hosting an additional Boss Kill Event in Path of Exile where players can compete to kill the new Pinnacle Bosses from the Secrets of the Atlas expansion. The prize pool includes Godslayer’s Pride microtransactions and the opportunity to collaborate with our devs to create new Unique Items and Divination Cards. How to Join The Boss Kill event will be held as an HC SSF Event League (SSF for Consoles) that is available to all players during the event by clicking ""Join"" in the bottom right corner of the character select screen. Registration opens 30 minutes before the event begins and everyone is welcome to participate! Start time: July 24th at 1PM PDT. The event will last until all the prizes have been claimed. Prizepool Prizes will be awarded to the first ten players who kill all three of the new pinnacle bosses, called ""The Incarnations"" in their non-quest variations (Area level 84). Prizes for Top Placings - PC 1st: Design a Unique for new Pinnacle Boss: Incarnation of Dread or the future-released Uber variant of this Boss Fight & Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. The first place winner will also get some additional design space with their item if they want to do something a little different. For example, if you would like to design a Unique Map or if you would like to design a Unique Item that requires a unique-piece from each of the three Bosses, then needs to be combined to create something more epic, this is something we will allow, so feel free to stray from the norm! This is something our team will help provide more details on during collaboration. 2nd: Design a Unique for new Pinnacle Boss: Incarnation of Neglect or the future-released Uber variant of this Boss Fight & Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. 3rd: Design a Unique for new Pinnacle Boss: Incarnation of Fear or the future-released Uber variant of this Boss Fight & Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. 4th-10th place: Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. There is also a set of prizes for defeating bosses that were historically significant to Zana, who has returned in this expansion. Bonus prizes will be awarded to the first players to defeat Uber Sirus, Uber Uber Elder, Uber Shaper or Uber Cortex. There is also a bonus prize for defeating Catarina. Bonus Prizes - PC First Catarina Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from Catarina, you can even input on the custom Veiled Modifiers that will be able to be unveiled on this Unique. First Uber Uber Elder Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from the Uber Elder or Uber Uber Elder. First Uber Shaper Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from the Shaper or Uber Shaper. First Uber Sirus Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from Sirus or Uber Sirus, The Awakener. First Uber Cortex Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from Cortex or Uber Cortex. Consoles The event will also be available on Consoles with separate prize pools from PC. Prizes for Top Placings - (both Xbox and Playstation have separate prize pools) 1st-3rd place: Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. 4th-10th place: A Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. Additional Rules A player can win both a Placing prize and one or more Bonus Prizes. Winners of the first Boss Kill event can participate in the second one. Players who migrate from a private league to Mercenaries HC SSF during the event are ineligible for prizes. Placings and prize eligibility are entirely at the discretion of Grinding Gear Games. The prizes that consist of collaborating on the design of a Divination Card or Unique Item do not guarantee that the item will turn out exactly how you want. The design team will try to accommodate your suggestions as best as they can, but the final design is at their discretion. Because these Unique Items are likely to become chase content, it's critical that they fit the overall design vision of Path of Exile. The balance and drop chances of these items after their release is entirely at the discretion of Grinding Gear Games. While the event being SSF reduces a lot of scope for outside help, any form of account sharing (or other breaches of the Terms of Use) will disqualify a player from receiving prizes. Grinding Gear Games Employees (past or present) are not eligible for prizes. Dying or migrating your character out of the league doesn't remove prize eligibility as long as the kill occurred while in the league. Prizes cannot be transferred. Only the person who completed the achievements in the event can collaborate on the Unique Item and Divination Card designs. It's fine for these people to seek advice and help from other comm...",1752715005,

238960,Development Stories - Who is the Originator?,"The world building and lore introduced in Secrets of the Atlas has set us up for expansions to come! We asked our Audio and Narrative Director Kane, to delve into some of the intricacies of piecing all of its components together. Hello! Kane here. You may know me previously as the Audio Lead at GGG… Well I’m still one of those, but now also narrative falls under my wheelhouse. I often pinch myself as a reminder that I’m not dreaming because this is quite literally a dream combination of things I love… and let me tell you, it brings me a great deal of joy! Anyway, where was I? Oh yes. Secrets of the Atlas. I should mention upfront, if you want to experience Secrets of the Atlas without spoilers, perhaps don’t read this. It is a bit tricky to discuss its narrative development without going into at least some of the details. As is the case these days, Mark (Neon) and I began with some bullet points for the basic narrative of what we’d be working towards. For Secrets of the Atlas, those were something along the lines of: Zana.… Brother?!…… THREE SHAPER-ESQUE BOSSES?! OMG! After those initial conversations, I knew we were off to a strong start and I was hyped to get started and piece together the dialogue and events for the narrative design. The initial premise here was to uncover what Zana has been doing since we lost track of her in the Atlas. That expanded into three main components to the expansion's story, with Zana’s plight at the core of it all. The first component: Eagon Introducing Eagon, a mysterious fellow claiming to be Zana’s brother, gave us a lot of interesting angles to explore Zana’s mission from. Like us veteran Exiles, he knows a lot about Zana and feels a connection to her, yet she is essentially a stranger to him. He believes that she simply must have all the answers to his burning questions about his heritage… and yet life is never so simple. He has spent his life trying to uncover and realize who he is and perhaps, why he is. Working towards unraveling who Eagon is and helping him try to piece things together makes him quite relatable as a person. Despite his rather pompous sense of entitlement (we are all flawed), he just wants to understand who he is, his place in the world and to save who he believes to be his sister. The Voice of Eagon When casting this character, I knew we needed a voice actor who could fully embody Eagon’s unique personality and portray it correctly. One audition immediately stuck out as the right fit. Leon Wadham brought Eagon to life in a perfect way. The second component: ZanaInterestingly for this expansion, Zana doesn’t exactly occupy screen-time a great deal. It is what she has created that we are able to explore, and trying to understand why she has done so is what drives the story forward. Eagon discovers that Zana has been experimenting with the Atlas and manifesting memories, and even ideas, into reality. But why? We are able to see what has mattered most to her, in the very areas we traverse and the figures we fight. In many ways, this exposure to Zana is more effective than even talking to her directly. Her memory threads are split into 3 groups of paired themes, based on Loneliness and Neglect, Trauma and Fear, and Reverence and Dread. Loneliness and NeglectThis is first touched on by encountering a form of Sirus at a time unfamiliar to us, exploring the deeper part of their connection and her regrets with what became of a relationship she neglected. Once we defeat this part of the thread, we can enter the ‘Moment of Loneliness’ where we witness Zana as a child, trying and failing, to get her father’s attention. This moment then transforms into the ‘Incarnation of Neglect’, where a permutation of her father is presented as a monstrous creation that we must overcome on her behalf. Trauma and FearThese themes are explored by her residual trauma from the Templars and how they treated her and her father, exemplified by the fight with the Cardinal of Fear. This allows us entry into the ‘Moment of Trauma’ where we witness young Zana making her father quite cross. This moment then becomes the ‘Incarnation of Fear’, a frightening imagining of someone her father never truly was. Reverence and DreadThis theme is shown in the form of Innocence, a God, taking the main stage as a revered but deceitful figure - yet another whose promises are to be broken. This thread line shows that even with good intentions, the grip of power can subvert even divine motivations. After beating this form of Innocence, we can enter the ‘Moment of Reverence’ where we witness child Zana watching her father deliver a speech in Oriath. This moment is then reshaped into the ‘Incarnation of Dread’, showing just how much her fathers notoriety and influence affected her. The Voice of Zana Zana is back, baby! It was fantastic to have Katherine Kennard back to reprise her role, and she did so quite effortlessly. It is quite amazing how actors can return to a role after some time and immediately l...",1751492971,
238960,Mercenaries of Trarthus Statistics,"The Mercenaries of Trarthus have joined us for a few weeks now, and they've been a blast in more ways than one! In today's news post, we go over some fun and interesting stats related to the loot they've been hauling from Trarthus or looting from Wraeclast. These stats were collected on Day 12 of the league. Check them out below! Tabula Rasa has spawned on 128,311 Mercenaries in the campaign. 61,547 of them were skipped. Wanderlust has spawned on 97,173 Mercenaries in the campaign. 50,120 of them were skipped. The Squire has spawned on 2 Mercenaries. One player didn't interact with the Mercenary. The other decided to instead receive 2 Chaos Orbs. Rakiata's Dance has spawned on Mercenaries 4 times. The Mercenary was not interacted with for 2 of them. One player chose to receive the sword. The other player preferred 8 Chaos Orbs and 4 Vaal Orbs. Defiance of Destiny has spawned on Mercenaries 8 times. On 3 of them, the Mercenary was not interacted with. 3 players could not defy destiny and lost their duels The remaining 2 were successfully claimed. Soul Taker has spawned on Mercenaries 9 times. On 6 of them, the Mercenary was not interacted with. 1 player lost the duel and had their soul taken away instead. 1 player chose assorted low-value currency. 1 player successfully took the Soul Taker. Kalandra's Touch has spawned on Mercenaries 356 times. On 88 of them, the Mercenary was not interacted with. 268 players interacted with the Mercenary. 34 players lost their touch, and lost their duels. 47 duel winners chose assorted low-value currency instead. 1 player hired the Mercenary. 7 players sent their Mercenaries to Exile. Headhunter has spawned on Mercenaries 211 times. On 42 of them, the Mercenary was not interacted with. 149 players won their duels against their Mercenaries. 11 of those players chose to receive an assortment of low value currency from the rucksack instead of picking the Headhunter as their reward. 2 duel winners chose to banish the Mercenary. Of the remaining Headhunters, 20 players had their skulls added to the belt of Mercenary, including one player chose to hire the Mercenary, but failed to defeat it. Mageblood has spawned on Mercenaries 157 times. On 34 of them, the Mercenary was not interacted with. 11 players lost their duels. 112 players won their duels. 14 of these duel winners chose to receive an assortment of low value currency from the rucksack. 2 duel winners sent their Mercenary, and thus also their Mageblood, to Exile. Mirror of Kalandra has spawned on 14 Mercenaries. Of these, 7 were skipped, so a year of bad luck for each one results in seven years of bad luck! 5 players successfully claimed their Mirror(s). 2 players lost their duels, losing 2 Mirrors each. One of these players didn't even die to the Mercenary, but got third partied by a Vendigo they had neglected to kill before beginning their duel. Infamous Warpriest of the Ruckus has spawned a single time, but was not interacted with. Sad! Hopefully another one will be found, the number of maps required to find him is approximately equivalent to the number of years since the dinosaurs became extinct, so no guarantees. There's still plenty of time to interact with the Mercenaries of Trarthus to get your challenges done. Be sure to keep an eye on your Mercenary's inventory, and best of luck with your duels!",1751408285,
238960,"Update on Server Issues, Compromised Accounts and Visual Flickering","We'd like to provide an update on a few important things that have been happening in Path of Exile. Server Issues We've been very focused on improving DDoS protection for our servers. Unfortunately, some of the protective measures have blocked legitimate traffic, causing instances to unexpectedly close. We're working closely with our server providers to finish setting up protection and resolve these issues as soon as possible. Compromised Accounts There have recently been an increased amount of reports regarding players having their accounts compromised. We've looked into as many reports as we could, and will continue to do so, however we have found no evidence of any kind of security breach on our end. If you're not already, we strongly recommend using secure and unique passwords. If you login through Steam but previously used the Standalone client, your email and password is still a valid login method and you should ensure this password is secure and unique. Visual Flickering We're aware that gameplay elements and the game's UI will start to flicker in and out when gameplay gets a bit hectic. The engine team is urgently looking into this and we're hoping to have an update on this issue next week. Thank you all for your patience as we work through these issues. ",1750996001,

238960,How Secrets of the Atlas Launch Went,"We wanted to give an update talking about how the launch went and what we’re immediately working on. Over the weekend we launched Path of Exile: Secrets of the Atlas. We are so thrilled to see the number of people who joined us for launch day. Welcome back, Exiles! Starting with the elephant in the room, unfortunately our European servers have been facing a barrage of DDOS attacks. We understand that this issue has ruined such an anticipated launch for many players. This is unacceptable service and we are deeply sorry. We want to assure you that we are taking this very seriously and it is the highest priority problem for our company to solve. Due to the nature of these attacks, we’re unable to provide a timeframe on when it will be resolved but we do want to acknowledge that we do see the issue and are doing everything we can to mitigate this. Another thing we caught just prior to the launch was an issue with our final console builds which did not affect our internal realms so couldn’t have been caught sooner than it was. Because this required brand new builds to be created, tested and then certified, this process took quite a long time to fix, but the console realms are now fully operational and players are able to login and play. We are implementing measures to prevent this occurring in the future. While our system administration and backend team address the issues with the European servers, our development team continues to monitor feedback. Currently the leading issue we’re looking to address with the league is that a number of Mercenary skills, especially once you get to the middle of the campaign start to deal overwhelming amounts of damage to the player, often instantly killing you, you should expect a patch in the near future that puts all these skills more in line. This will not affect the Mercenary balance when they are your ally. Additionally we’re looking at making some improvements to the Memory Skills granted in maps influenced by The Originator, we’ll have more updates on this later this week. We also just wanted to give a huge thank you to all our players, be it those who have returned to play Path of Exile after a year with no expansions, and all those who are new to the game. We’re very excited to not only once again be delivering content, but playing the game alongside you all. Thank you Exiles!",1750115661,

The original Grinding Gear Games ARPG, built as a spiritual successor to Diablo 2 and now well over a decade old, continues to prove why it's so beloved among the loot-grinding faithful even set against its own sequel. With a major endgame overhaul and the introduction of mercenary companions, Secrets of the Atlas and the new Mercenaries of Trarthus league make now the ideal time to give Path of Exile a try. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/secrets-of-the-atlas-player-count"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/3-26-league-update-mercenary-renown"">Path of Exile 3.26 gets bigger right before launch, as GGG adds mercenary renown</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/3-26-different-poe2"">Path of Exile 3.26 pushes the free ARPG away from PoE 2, so both can coexist</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/3-26-secrets-of-the-atlas"">Path of Exile 3.26 brings a big endgame upgrade and mercenaries to the free ARPG</a> ",1749905013,

238960,Mercenaries of Trarthus - Renown,"Since the Path of Exile: Secrets of the Atlas reveal last week we’ve continued to make changes to the Mercenaries league. One such change is the introduction of the Renown system. We’ve made a quick video for you to checkout but if you’d prefer to read it at your own pace we’ve included that too! As you defeat Mercenaries, you will gain Renown among the Trarthan arrivals to Wraeclast. Successfully defeating a Mercenary will push you up one rank of Renown, to a maximum of three, whereas either losing or backing out of a fight will cost you one rank. Backing out means that you speak to a Mercenary, view their gear and skills, then walk away and never fight that Mercenary. Returning to them in the same area will allow you to fight them without penalty. Only leaving and never returning to fight them will cost you Renown as they will spread the word of your cowardice amongst the other Trarthans. For each rank of Renown that you have, you have increased odds of encountering Infamous Mercenaries, who come from far and wide to test their mettle against you. Infamous Mercenaries are tougher fights, but have better Rucksack loot, are equipped with more powerful rare items, always have at least one unique item equipped and are the only source of Infamous modifier items. As we mentioned in our FAQ post, you will also encounter Infamous Mercenaries more often in maps with higher numbers of modifiers, to reward you for making the content more difficult. To spot an Infamous Mercenary, keep an eye out for this fancier golden border, as well as the prefix ""Infamous"" before their archetype! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/5193306/156df6b7e427ca689c86297064deac00d3c0038f.jpg ",1749782446,

As it makes its grand return, I sat down with game director Mark 'Neon' Roberts to talk about the new PoE league, returning to a four-month cycle, and whether the success of Path of Exile 2 has changed how GGG approaches its predecessor. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/3-26-different-poe2"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/3-26-secrets-of-the-atlas"">Path of Exile 3.26 brings a big endgame upgrade and mercenaries to the free ARPG</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/3-26-pausing"">The Path of Exile 3.26 update introduces a highly requested but divisive feature</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/path-of-exile/new-custom-leagues-poe"">While we wait on Path of Exile 3.26, new custom leagues are here to fill the gap</a> ",1749659256,

238960,Secrets of the Atlas Frequently Asked Questions,"In our recent GGG Live stream, Mark and Jonathan sat down for a Q&A with ZiggyD. In today's news post, we've provided answers to some of the most frequently asked questions that didn't make it into the livestream. Check them out! How does equipping Mercenaries with items work? Can any Mercenary be equipped with any item? Each Mercenary is associated with Attributes. Mercenaries will generate with gear that matches the Attributes they are associated with, and will only be able to be equipped with new Armour gear that matches their Attributes in the following way: For Mercenaries with a single Attribute, any Armour gear that requires that Attribute is valid. For Mercenaries with multiple Attributes, any Armour gear that requires an Attribute not associated with that Mercenary is invalid. As an example: A Strength Mercenary will be equippable with gear requiring just Strength, Strength + Dexterity or Strength + Intelligence. A Dexterity/Intelligence Mercenary will be equippable with gear requiring just Dexterity, just Intelligence or Dexterity + Intelligence. Mercenaries do not need to meet attribute requirements outside of the above rule. Mercenaries need to be within 70% of level requirements of an item to equip it. Mercenaries also have preferred weapon types, and will not equip weapons that do not match their preferred types. Generally, they are going to prefer weapons that they can actually use their skills with. Will Map modifiers affect rewards from Mercenaries? Increased Quantity on a Map Area from Map Modifiers will increase the chances that you find an Infamous Mercenary in that area. Are Link skills able to target allied Mercenaries? Yes, you can link to an allied Mercenary. Just make sure they don’t die on you. Can Gold appear as a reward in a Mercenary's pouch? No. Can Mercenaries be renamed? No. Can Mercenaries use items with influenced trigger skills (like Shaper weapons with Cast on Crit)? Short answer - No. Longer answer - Mercenary Skills are not socketed into gear in the way that player skills are. They are inherent to the Mercenary rather than being the result of a socketed gem, so in the case of something like a Cast on Crit weapon, it would be hard to determine what skill should even be triggered - or indeed, do the triggering. Will Mercenaries be tradable with other players? Mercenaries are not tradeable. Are Mercenaries account bound or character bound? Account bound. Do Mercenaries get passive skills from gear, such as the anointed notables on amulets or keystones from Uniques? Anointed passive skills will work. Keystones from Uniques also will work. Will the Trarthan gems also appear in the Divine Font at the end of the Labyrinth, or are they only available from Mercenaries? Trarthan Gems are only available from Mercenaries (starting in level 68+ areas), and each individual Gem is only available from a specific variety of Mercenary. Will Animate Guardian get an equipment interface similar to Mercenaries? How will that work? No. However, it's worth mentioning that Animate Guardian has been changed in the following way: Animated Guardians now retain their items when they die. However, if your Animated Guardian dies you cannot summon an Animated Guardian again in that area (unless that area is a hideout). Are the new Pinnacle bosses able to be witnessed by the Maven? No (maybe in the future though). Are there Uber versions of the new Pinnacle Bosses? No (maybe in the future though). Although note the quest version of the boss is easier than the repeatable endgame version. Are there going to be the ""tier 4"" Syndicate leader rewards after killing Catarina? The treasure room after the Catarina fight, is that still there or is it randomized/gone? They're gone. Does interacting with Syndicate members pause the game too? Yes. Are we still going to have to hire workers in Kingsmarch? Yes, the town is pre-built and completed but workers will still need to be hired and paid for. Does a Runebind count as a ""different"" mastery for the purpose of skills like Trickster's Polymath, or do they count as the same mastery, for the purpose of things like the life mastery that grants 10% more life if you have 6 life masteries? Yes, although all Runegrafts count as the same type of Mastery. They do not count as Life masteries.",1749518134,
238960,Secrets of the Atlas Boss Kill Event,"To celebrate the launch of Secrets of the Atlas, we’re hosting a Boss Kill Event where Path of Exile players can compete to kill the new Pinnacle Bosses in the Mercenaries HC SSF League. We have put together a prize pool that gives the winners the opportunity to collaborate with our design team to create new Unique Items and Divination cards that will be added to Path of Exile. Prizes will be awarded to the first ten players who kill all three of the new pinnacle bosses, called ""The Incarnations"" in their non-quest variations (Area level 84). Prizes for Top Placings - PC: 1st: Design a Unique for new Pinnacle Boss: Incarnation of Dread or the future-released Uber variant of this Boss Fight & Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. The first place winner will also get some additional design space with their item if they want to do something a little different. For example, if you would like to design a Unique Map or if you would like to design a Unique Item that requires a unique-piece from each of the three Bosses, then needs to be combined to create something more epic, this is something we will allow, so feel free to stray from the norm! This is something our team will help provide more details on during collaboration. 2nd: Design a Unique for new Pinnacle Boss: Incarnation of Neglect or the future-released Uber variant of this Boss Fight & Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. 3rd: Design a Unique for new Pinnacle Boss: Incarnation of Fear or the future-released Uber variant of this Boss Fight & Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. 4th-10th place: Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. To celebrate Zana's return, there will also be a set of prizes for defeating bosses that were historically significant to her. Bonus prizes will be awarded to the first players to defeat Uber Sirus, Uber Elder, Uber Shaper or Uber Cortex. To celebrate Betrayal's rework, there is also a bonus prize for defeating Catarina. Bonus Prizes - PC: First Catarina Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from Catarina, you can even input on the custom Veiled Modifiers that will be able to be unveiled on this Unique. First Uber Elder Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from the Elder or Uber Elder. First Uber Shaper Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from the Shaper or Uber Shaper. First Uber Sirus Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from Sirus or Uber Sirus, The Awakener. First Uber Cortex Kill: Collaborate on the design of a Unique Item that will drop from Cortex or Uber Cortex. Console players can also participate in this event with separate prize pools from PC. The Console Boss Kill Event will take place in the SSF Mercenaries League. Prizes for Top Placings - (both Xbox and Playstation have separate prize pools): 1st-3rd place: Collaborate on the design of a Divination Card + Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. 4th-10th place: A Godslayer's Pride Microtransaction. Additional Rules: A player can win both a Placing prize and one or more Bonus Prizes. If there are operational problems with the event (like significant realm stability issues at launch), Grinding Gear Games may restart the event at any point. The way we will do this is to create a new event league and indicate that players who wish to compete in the new event must make new characters there. Players who migrate from a private league to Mercenaries HC SSF during the event are ineligible for prizes. Placings and prize eligibility are entirely at the discretion of Grinding Gear Games. The prizes that consist of collaborating on the design of a Divination Card or Unique Item do not guarantee that the item will turn out exactly how you want. The design team will try to accommodate your suggestions as best as they can, but the final design is at their discretion. Because these Unique Items are likely to become chase content, it's critical that they fit the overall design vision of Path of Exile. The balance and drop chances of these items after their release is entirely at the discretion of Grinding Gear Games. While the event being SSF reduces a lot of scope for outside help, any form of account sharing (or other breaches of the Terms of Use) will disqualify a player from receiving prizes. Grinding Gear Games Employees (past or present) are not eligible for prizes. Players who have played on the Alpha realm since June 6th, 2025 (when the expansion was first deployed) are not eligible for prizes. Dying or migrating your character out of the league doesn't remove prize eligibility as long as the kill occurred while in the league. Prizes cannot be transferred. Only the person who completed the achievements in the event can collaborate on the Unique Item and Divination Card designs. It's f...",1749432245,
238960,What Will Happen When The Settlers League Ends,"The Settlers Challenge League will end soon and you may be wondering what will happen when it does. Kingsmarch will be going core in 3.26.

Here's what you can expect once the league ends: Gold in both your inventory and in your Kingsmarch Treasury will be preserved, but will not be visible or usable until the launch of 3.26.

Today’s news post goes into more detail about what to expect! Next week we’ll add 15 Private League templates for PC that you'll be able to create for free with up to 20,000 players in each event. We are planning to have these templates available for a month, approximately until the end of May. A private league template means you will not be able to add your own modifiers like you would normally be able to. We’ve tried to ensure there is an event for every type of player! All of these events are based on Settlers league. For players who just want to try things out with nothing too complicated or dangerous we have: Just Settlers - Pretty self explanatory, it's just Settlers league. Idols - Atlas Passive Tree has been replaced with the Idol system from Legacy of Phrecia. Alternate Ascendancies - All Ascendancies have been replaced with Alternate Ascendancies from the Legacy of Phrecia event. Necro Settlers - Monsters in every area are affected by a pool of mods which you will be able to manipulate upon entering that area, these will rotate every hour! Shifting Stones - In each area you will encounter a league mechanic that has been enhanced by a corresponding Atlas Keystone! These will change every 15 minutes. For the thrillseekers out there, warning: Danger! We’ve taken each of the events above and turned the difficulty dial right up by including Gauntlet Boss Enhancements and some dangerous modifiers from the Gauntlet. These Gauntlet mods are from the most recent Gauntlet event, however we've toned down some of the modifiers for the Uber Bosses (Area Level 85+) so they're a bit more reasonable but still challenging: From 50% Less Damage Taken to 25% From 100% Increased Damage to 50% From 40% Increased Attack, Cast and Movement Speed to 20% We’ve also created some new events for those who want to use new mechanics with some old ones! Affliction - Free wisps trapped in the Wildwood, doing so will empower monsters and improve their rewards! Idols + Kalandra - Reflect upon your Idols; Influence the Lake of Kalandra in every zone and replace Path of Exile's Atlas Passive Tree with the Idols system! Alternate Ascendancies + Sentinels - Explore alternative Ascendancy Classes while harnessing ancient Sentinels to control the risk and reward of combat. Necro Settlers + Beyond - Noticing your use of the Lantern of Arimor, Beyond demons have begun invading! Shifting Stones + Atlas Invasion - On top of each area having enhanced league mechanics, each area will also be invaded by Atlas Bosses. We’ll have another post next week that will include any extra information you might need, such as when these events will begin! Thanks to everyone who played Legacy of Phrecia! ",1745384943,

238960,Respeccing Ascendancy Classes And More,"As the week wraps up, we've pulled together a list of changes we're targeting for deployment in a patch mid next week. We've been busy making improvements to Path of Exile 2—here’s what’s on the way. One of the most requested features we have had is the ability to respec Ascendancy classes. However, something that was important to us is to make sure that while it can be done, it does require some level of effort. We have implemented it in the following way: Redoing an Ascendancy Trial allows you to respec which Ascendancy Class you have chosen at the Ascension device, but only if the Trial would grant you the number of points you already have. In order to respec your Ascendancy class, you must have zero points allocated in it, but you can now open the Respec window at Balbala or the Trialmaster who are standing next to the Ascension device. Ultimatums that have 7 chambers and thus grant up to 4 Ascendancy points now can be done from level 55 down from 60. Ultimatums that have 10 chambers and thus grant up to 6 Ascendancy points can now be done from level 65 down from 75. This change should be deployed in the next restart patch, currently anticipated to be mid next week. In addition, we have some other changes that have been made today that will be in that patch as well. Endgame Changes An unintentional problem with Tower maps and Hideout maps is that they don't currently spawn the rare monsters for the clear condition. Due to this, they also don't drop the extra map that is designed to allow for guaranteed map sustain. We have added extra rares to Tower and Hideout maps, and also the extra map drop that can come from the final rare kill. This is still not required to complete the map. Crafting Changes As each new Rune Tier is unlocked we are removing the lower runes from the drop pool. This is to stop you getting spammed with lesser runes at high levels. We will adjust drop rates as that occurs so that you get a more reasonable number of total runes. We are adding the ability to add sockets to Scepters and adding mods to some Talismans for Scepters to allow upgrades to your minions at mid to late game. Totem Changes We have had quite a few reports of totems not surviving at endgame due to not gaining as much elemental resistance as the player does. In order to solve this problem we have made the following changes Totems start gaining elemental resistances from gem level 15 up to 75% at level 20. The Ironwood support also adds some Maximum Elemental Resistance to totems. Shard Scavenger The Shard Scavenger reservation wasn't doing enough to be useful to most players, so we made the following change. Shard Scavenger, in addition to its current effects, now also restores one cooldown use for all your Grenades and grants a buff for 2 seconds that prevents your Crossbow Attacks consuming bolts. My Skills on the Gemcutting Tab When using an uncut skill gem, it was often annoying to find the skills that you were using from off-classes to level up. In order to fix that, we have added a new tab to the gemcutting window that shows you all the gems you have equipped. This list of the changes are just the changes that have been made so far, these are not the only changes we are investigating and they do not represent a full list of what players are reporting to us.
