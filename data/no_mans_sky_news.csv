275850,2025 - one of our biggest yet!,"Hello,Well, we’re coming to the end of another incredibly busy year for No Man’s Sky, one that has seen us hit our highest player numbers since launch, and we couldn’t be more grateful for being able to continue this journey with you all nine years after our initial launch. It would mean the world to our tiny team if you could take a few moments to nominate us for the “Labor of Love” category in the upcoming Steam Awards. It feels like, this year in particular, there’s been a lot of “labor” to love, with 5 major updates and 4 expeditions. We kicked off the year in January with the release of the much anticipated Worlds Part II update. Completing the transformation of the universe which 2024’s Worlds Part I started, Part II introduced new stars, new story, and new planets. Ancient ruins, gas giants and water worlds were there to be explored and strange creatures, varied biomes and dramatic terrain to be discovered. New gameplay and huge improvements in lighting and water rendering capped off one of our biggest first updates of the year and was a real statement of intent for the rest of the year.In March, we delved into the pre-history of the No Man’s Sky universe with the release of the Relics update. Hundreds of unique bones could now be excavated from beneath your feet as you journeyed from planet to planet, assembling skeletons to design fossil exhibits, and joining the community on an expedition to recreate lost creatures and battle against gargantuan stone guardians. In May, the Beacon update encouraged players to expand their planetary empire by becoming Overseer of multiple settlements, and discover the townships of the secretive robotic Autophage. Beacon also coincided with the release of the Switch 2 version as a Day 1 game and is a free update for Switch 1 owners! In August, for our ninth anniversary, we released the mammoth and transformative Voyagers. Travellers were now able to create their own colossal, fully furnished, completely bespoke Corvette-class starship, invite their friends on board…and then spacewalk or sky-dive out of them together. Voyagers saw our player numbers return to levels we’d not seen in 9 years and it was genuinely thrilling to welcome so many people, new and old, to our weird little universe. In October our Halloween update, Breach, players traversed a desolate and abandoned universe and encountered the abandoned remains of ill-fated corvette ships, all ripe for scavenging ship modules to add to their corvette-building arsenal. In addition to these major updates, we have also run 4 community expeditions each with their own unique theme, challenges and rewards, including the return of the Normandy from Mass Effect a few months ago for N7 Day. For those of you who weren’t able to participate in these the first time around, we are re-running those in a reduxed fashion right now for the holiday season. Full dates and details can be found here.No Man’s Sky has now had well over 30 major updates since it launched in 2016, and the ridiculously small development team continues to amaze me with their energy and ideas, and their commitment to support the game across so many formats (PC, GOG, Steam Deck, PCVR, PS4, PS5, PSVR1 and 2, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 & 2, Mac).As we look towards our 10th anniversary year next year, they are showing no signs of slowing down. We will continue as long as they are enjoying creating and the community are enjoying what they are making. It truly is a labor of love for me and for them. In the background, another tiny team at Hello is continuing at pace on our next Labor of Love, Light No Fire, and we know a lot of you are keen to hear more. For now, it suffices to say that I am really pleased with the progress we are making and I think it’s going to be something really special. You can wishlist it here.Our journey continues.Sean ",1764007278,"['steam_award_nomination_request', 'mod_hide_library_overview']"

275850,Announcing..the 2025 Expedition Reduxes,"Hello Everyone!It's been another incredibly busy year for No Man's Sky. We're honestly amazed by how quickly 2025 has flown past, and so happy and humbled to be back here wrapping up the year with the return of our now-traditional expedition reduxes.We hit the ground running in January this year, with the release of the huge WORLDS PART II, which furthered the transformation of the universe with new stars, planets, mountains and oceans, creatures and biomes, and lore. The team felt very passionate about this return to some of the fundamentals of No Man's Sky, and we could feel the anticipation building for this follow-up to WORLDS PART I, so the positive reception felt incredible.In the months that followed, we've introduced bone-hunting and fossil design in RELICS, deepened planetary settlements in BEACON, and brought multi-crew, self-assembled starships in VOYAGERS - a feature that we hoped players would like, but we couldn't possibly have anticipated the response. We saw the highest number of simultaneous players in game since we launched nine years ago - and so many astonishingly creative ship builds! Some of the team like to sit docked in the Space Anomaly just to watch your extraordinary creations fly in and out.Among the updates this year, we've also run four new community expeditions. Each of these themed mission chains unites the whole community for several weeks, gathering everyone together in this sprawling universe that can often be quite a solitary experience - and offers the opportunity to earn special limited-edition rewards. However, we know that life is busy, so we are delighted to be able to offer players another opportunity to participate in some of our previous expeditions.It's almost November 7th - a significant date to fans of the fantastic Mass Effect series - and to celebrate N7 Day, we are again collaborating with our friends at BioWare and EA to run the Beachhead expedition, and offer the No Man's Sky community another opportunity to claim the legendary SSV Normandy SR1. We've welcomed many new Travellers to No Man's Sky since the Normandy's last appearance in the Euclid galaxy, so we hope this news comes as a welcome surprise to our fellow Mass Effect fans!Following Beachhead, as has become customary, we will be re-running this year's expeditions over two-week intervals over the holiday season - over Thanksgiving, Christmas, and through to the middle of January.Beachhead: 7th Nov - 18th Nov The inhabitants of the Space Anomaly have detected something impossible: a fluctuation in history already written. A new pattern is emerging in the stories of the ancient Gek, Korvax, and Vy’keen. Something is coming: a legendary weapon that always appears whenever it is needed...Titan: 19th Nov - 2nd Dec Chart a dazzling array of new stars and new worlds formed in Worlds Part II: gas giants, endless oceans and cloud-skimming mountains. Earn exclusive rewards, including a unique living ship dredged from the inky depths of a water world.Relics: 3rd Dec - 16th Dec Sign up with the Galactic Palaeology Society and join the community on a journey to recreate ancient lifeforms, uncover secrets left undisturbed for millennia, and earn a complete living stone appearance override.Corvette: 17th Dec - 30th Dec Your former starship has been damaged beyond repair, and the Sentinel horde is closing in. Assemble your own corvette-class starship, maximise its stats and potential, and take refuge amongst the stars! Earn an array of exclusive rewards, including the one-of-a-kind Mecha Mouse robotic companion.Breach: 31st Dec - 13th Jan Traverse a desolate and abandoned universe, confronting both the awe and the horror that lurks in deep space. Follow the tale of the ill-faded Fireship Arcadia, step into zero-gravity, and scavenge modules from its wreckage to enhance your own corvette builds. Complete milestones to earn a set of ancient, powerful Atlas-themed corvette modules.Development UpdateOur Halloween expedition, Breach, wraps up later today - and the first of our expedition ""remixes"", Beachhead, will begin tomorrow on November 7th!This has been an inspiring, exciting year for No Man's Sky, and we already have so much more content planned and in active development. We can't wait to share it with you.You might already know that we also have another project in the works - a fantasy game about adventure and exploration with friends. It's called Light No Fire, and we're pretty excited about it. If you'd like to stay updated with news about Light No Fire, you can wishlist it on Steam here.Our journey continues.Sean ",1762511294,

275850,Introducing...No Man's Sky Breach,"Hello,Well, we suspected that the No Man’s Sky Voyagers update was going to cause some excitement in the universe, but never did we expect such a huge influx- seeing player numbers we’ve not seen since launch… nine years ago!Our update for Halloween is called Breach, and it leans into the thrill of custom ship assembly, space-walking, skydiving, and community spirit introduced in Voyagers. It is free to download today for existing players. Full patch notes are available here.In Breach, players will traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and on their travels encounter the abandoned remains of ill-fated corvette ships, all ripe for scavenging ship modules to add to your corvette-building arsenal. Excavating these wrecks will yield an array of corvette pieces including rare vertical parts which unlock a whole new range of build configurations for the more creative designers. Among the exclusive expedition rewards, there is also a set of Atlas-themed modules for those wanting to demonstrate their allegiance to the all-seeing entity.The jewel in the crown of these wreckages is the Fireship Arcadia, the fate of which you will learn as you venture through Breach. But you will have to face your fears and make a leap of faith into the black as you space-walk through these eerie systems to glean its unique remnants.Breach ExpeditionThe spooky Breach Expedition embraces the darker side of the universe and will also lure the bravest Travellers towards the ominous and exotic purple-star solar systems which players first glimpsed in Worlds Part II back in January. The planets in these systems are particularly foreboding with their deep, abyssal oceans, unearthly entities and the notoriously imposing and volatile gas giants.The Breach Expedition begins today, and will run for approximately three weeks.Space WreckageIn the far reaches of deep space, wrecked corvettes can now be encountered and salvaged. Step out into zero-gravity to explore these hollow hulks, and equip your Multi-Tool laser to dismantle their valuable modules - then repurpose this scrap to build your dream ship at a Corvette Workshop.New Corvette ModulesA significant number of new corvette modules are now salvageable from deep-space corvette wrecks and planetary scrapheaps. These include new landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and a number of highly-requested wedge-shaped modules that enable a huge variety of creative and complicated corvette builds.Quality of LifeIn addition to the bundle of fixes, improvements, and new features in today’s update, the No Man’s Sky team have been hard at work on improving Voyagers since its launch in August. Notably, snapping is greatly improved, collision is more robust, and the Corvette Workshop now offers the option to apply a colour palette to an entire corvette. There has never been a better time to build a corvette!Breach Expedition RewardsEvent Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars PostersThese decorative posters commemorating the Breach expedition depict a deep-space gravitational anomaly, the tileable eternal serpent of time, and a betentacled siren, poised to begin its mucal embrace…Aeron Cowling & DiffuserThe geometry of these corvette modules is ancient and unmistakable, shaped by the crimson heartbeat of the universe itself.The extruded Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates add a bold, angular appearance to your corvette’s silhouette.Wings of AeronThis Atlas-themed wing module stabilises the corvette during atmospheric flight.Aeron Pyramid, Aeron Pillar & Aeron WingletThese decorative Atlas-themed modules can be affixed to the corvette exterior, furthering the ship’s devotion to the crimson entity.Aeron PowershieldThe Aeron Powershield is linked to the corvette’s shielding system, providing a significant performance boost to the ship’s defence array.Aeron Starship TrailThis engine modification injects the Starship exhaust trail with an arterial streak of crimson.Aeron Drive & Aeron BladeDesign a hefty, heavyweight Atlas corvette with the bulky Aeron Drive, or favour a more lightweight, sleek aesthetic with the streamlined Aeron Blade wing.No Man’s Sky PlushiesThere are just two weeks left to order our limited-edition Traveller and Gek plushies before they warp away!Available to order here until November 5th.The tiny No Man’s Sky team have been running on more cylinders than even I thought they had this year with barely a breath taken between Worlds Part II, Relics, Beacon and the epic Voyagers. We’re still having a lot of fun, and, from the looks of our player numbers, so are many of the community.Full patch notes for the Breach update are available here.Our journey continues.SeanP.S.

275850,Introducing...No Man's Sky: Voyagers,"Hello!I can’t believe it’s been just over nine years since No Man’s Sky first launched. No Man’s Sky VOYAGERS is what we’re super busy with right now and is one of our most ambitious updates. It launches today. Full patch notes are available here.I’ve always loved Spaceships! Name a sci-fi film, book or game, and I want to talk to you about the spaceships in it! We know No Man’s Sky players feel the same - they spend countless hours searching the universe for their perfect ship. But what if you could design your own ship? If you could get out of your pilot's seat mid-flight and walk around? If you could invite your friends on board as crew?I guess that’s always been the ultimate fantasy for us. An infinite universe to explore with your ship and crew. Something we’ve always wanted to see brought together in one game.Afterall perhaps the most important character in No Man’s Sky is your space ship. It’s your safe haven on hazardous planets, your companion exploring the stars. Your ship is your way of experiencing the universe, and when we change that, it really changes how the game feels.We call them Corvettes, huge ships with hulls, wings, landing gear, cockpits, engine parts, thrusters and more - arranged to your own unique sci-fi design.These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters. It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.Adding bigger weapons to your Corvette increases your firepower. Add sleeping quarters, a nutrition unit and internal furnishings and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready to adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team. Or just a window… and suddenly there are these special moments, watching as the universe flies by outside at warp speed.Having multiple Corvettes flying over a planet together is incredible, especially when you pop the hatch and spacewalk or skydive from one ship to the other!By design, Corvettes are encountered a little way into the game and veteran players will be able to unlock them reasonably swiftly. But we wanted to give all players a taste of what they can expect, so the accompanying “Corvette” expedition is specifically designed to get you to the workshop as quickly as possible and to take you on a journey which unlocks some of the parts you’re going to need to build out your sci-fi fantasy.The team at Hello have been working on Voyagers for a long time. The technical challenges they have had to overcome to make any of this possible have been immense. Almost every part of the game has had to be reworked to accommodate these relative spaces. Having your multiplayer crew walking around, calmly editing your ship, as it travels at warp speeds towards a planet that is being generated as you approach. It's pretty insane what's going on behind the scenes to make that work.Much of the technology we’re introducing with Voyagers is shared with our next game, Light No Fire, which is a truly open world, a shared Earth-sized planet, with real oceans to traverse, needing large boats and crews. We love that we get to share this technology with players early. You can wishlist Light No Fire here.The most exciting thing about Voyagers for me is the possibilities it opens in the future for No Man’s Sky, and I can’t wait to see where the team takes it from here.I can’t believe that in the past 12 months we released Worlds Part I, Worlds Part II, and Voyagers - all huge changes to this game we care about so much.To celebrate our ninth anniversary, we’re also releasing our latest range of No Man’s Sky merchandise that we hope you’ll enjoy, including:PLUSHIESOur Gek and Traveller plushies are available for a limited time from youtooz here.MUSICWe’re releasing a new album!No Man’s Sky: Journeys will be released on music services, and vinyl pre-orders will open via Laced Records on September 18th.This release brings together music and soundscapes written for No Man’s Sky by 65daysofstatic and Paul Weir following the release of the original soundtrack back in 2016.

The now-iconic space game was a mess at launch, riddled with bugs and boring gameplay. However, developer Hello Games knuckled down and got to work improving things. After a lot of hard work, the game slowly brought players back on board. Once the base game was interesting, the team started expanding the experience. More vehicles, mechs, aliens, mechanics, bases... more <em>everything</em>, really. No Man's Sky went from being a punchline to a legitimately good game that you can while away hours in without even realising, and now it's celebrating its ninth birthday with some aliens that you can bring into your own home. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/no-mans-sky/ninth-anniversary"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/no-mans-sky/system-requirements"">No Man's Sky system requirements</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/no-mans-sky/update-beacon-settlements"">New No Man's Sky update lets you become a galactic mayor</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/no-mans-sky/update-relics-fossils"">New No Man's Sky update lets you dig for fossils of long-lost creatures</a> ",1754937486,

275850,Introducing...No Man's Sky BEACON,"Hello, Today we’re pleased to announce the release of our latest update for No Man’s Sky. BEACON completely overhauls settlements, bringing towns and their management to No Man’s Sky. There are huge new robotic settlements to discover, with impossibly new sci-fi buildings. Full patch notes are available here. Players can become town mayor and take ownership of multiple settlements. You can construct buildings and upgrade each one, with new building types like jukebox bars where you can choose the music, merchants where you can build custom starships or even ponds you can chill and fish at. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/2100f47edacfd4f4d3fdc822bff88c3c245f61f8.jpg One of the coolest additions in BEACON is the arrival of the robotic Autophage settlements. The most recent race introduced to No Man’s Sky, these large towns are built in their own image, an identifiable robotic style, all metal and mechanics. Unique Autophage building parts can be constructed in your own base and add a very hard sci-fi style to your dwellings and constructions. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/d5c66f4017f62b235c9ddbb343c7473890e09590.jpg For the ambitious Traveller, multiple settlements can now be owned and managed by one Overseer, so for instance you won’t need to abandon your existing charges to bring these new robotic citizens under your wing. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/b27631a26887f18543686897b89b9af6fae0dc5d.jpg Settlement visitors will also notice a complete level up of building details across all settlement types, including weathered building materials, upgraded settlement buildings and new settlement utilities. Each inhabitant can be conversed with, with their own abilities and attributes to manage. As town mayor you’ll be enlisted to welcome new settlers, resolve disputes, and make choices to create prosperity. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/637d23cd6adb4e5510ee31e19cbaf1c9122618da.jpg It’s not all work, work, work though! You and your citizens can enjoy the more relaxing aspects of new settlement life too, including music, fishing and firework parties. A well managed settlement can make their owners rich in resources, but they need to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen, who will now defend towns when they come under attack from roving pirates. Threats have become more varied and unpredictable so you will need to stay on your guard and be prepared to defend your investments at a moment's notice. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/fbbb163d4a0b0eb10e474f014e83f1d2e408c801.jpg To show the settlements off in their best light possible, and to level up the visuals of the No Man’s Sky universe overall, we are also introducing, with BEACON,a cutting edge graphical upgrade in the form of Intel XeSS2. The improvement this technology brings to the look and feel of the game is unbelievable. Away from the huge settlement makeover, BEACON offers many more quality of life improvements which the community will love, such as the ability to change or even disable the voice communicator of your exosuit, and improved base part snapping to name just a few. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/bf306652aff29e13a0edeef86c5e4a8807a81b07.png We introduced Cross-Save for No Man’s Sky at the end of last year to a limited few to ensure it was robust and that people’s thousand hour saves weren’t in jeopardy. Ever since we’ve slowly been opening up to more and more players and, with BEACON, I’m happy to announce that we are opening up Cross-Save fully to the entire player base. Now everyone can continue their travels no matter what platform they are playing on. And Cross Save and Cross Play are particularly important as this update we also are releasing a cutting edge version of No Man’s Sky for Switch 2 launch. It’s been fun to see Travellers exploring the universe in search of alien remains since we released the RELICS update last month, creating ever-wilder creature permutations and turning their bases into mini-museums. BEACON is the third update of the year and there’s plenty more planned. I’m so proud of the small team for continuing to pour such passion into this game we love so much. Full patch notes here.

Following hot on the heels of the massive Worlds Part II update back in January which introduced a whole range of visual enhancements, gameplay additions and quality of life improvements, the small No Man’s Sky team have let their imaginations run wild and been having a lot of fun playing around with something really whimsical but remarkably transformative for what is possibly our most surprising update yet. We’re calling it RELICS and it is available to download free to existing players from today. Full patch notes are available here. Since launch, because of the way that No Man’s Sky’s planetary terrain works, No Man’s Sky players have enjoyed being able to dig down through the earth to find buried technologies or other valuable items hidden beneath their feet. From today, players will start to find a whole new category of palaeontological finds - the skeletal remains of alien creatures which used to inhabit these worlds. So terrain manipulators at the ready! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/f12da0fb5c2c24d920c87cda6906e93c9a29896b.jpg Just as the living creatures which continue to populate the star systems, there is a huge variety of prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect. It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/c3faa5d89b99196f51a5553b5706eaefb5134b3a.jpg Much like with the aquatic life from the Aquarius expedition from last year, the skulls and bones out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. The most uncommon finds hold huge value and can be bartered with at the Space Station. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/52f496ffd9bd25105b844acc1d6382d069d5b40b.jpg To coincide with RELICS, a tailor-made community expedition starts shortly which challenges players to compete for the rarest finds. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/ec3ccacbc39a6900b54a8a863fb5fb75877a5e45.jpg Players should be wary where they choose to excavate though.

275850,Introducing...Worlds Part II,"Hello! No Man’s Sky is a game that we all genuinely truly love. Last year we released Worlds Part I and I remember thinking at the time that this is just the beginning. We can’t wait to show people what we’ve been working on! There’s new solar systems, new planets with more variety, new terrain types, even new Gas Giants, and of course new adventures. Our next update is called Worlds Part II. Full patch notes are available here. Worlds Part II allows us to push the boundaries of our engine with new technology. Across the universe we’re adding billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets, and introducing new biomes and terrains without changing what people already love about the game. It’s now so far beyond what we ever thought was possible when we started out. I’ve been working on a new terrain system for a little while now. Terrain is more detailed and far more varied with huge mountains and these massive features. I’m genuinely at my happiest working on this stuff. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/aee09e7b19565a6d3ca4f49615de55b91b057101.jpg The team is extremely busy on Light No Fire (wishlist it here!). Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with No Man’s Sky. Gas giants are truly epic, ten times bigger than our biggest planet. It’s truly end-game stuff to explore them with huge storms that rage across the surface. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/055a7cc4494425cfdbe41bb686d110c48711b01e.jpg New tech allows oceans that can be several kilometers deep. A new lighting system makes them look so different. New caustics, light shafts and the deeper that you explore the darker it gets. I’ve had these moments where you’re exploring and suddenly some huge creature comes into view and it’s just incredible. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/da4c5dd95908254c49b595733eff9879249d2709.jpg Every element of our lighting has been rewritten. Shadows show more details, light flickers through the leaves, caves are dark and immersive. Oceans now reflect the clouds and stars to create these beautiful sunsets and night skies. Water reacts physically to the world around it. Creatures wade through it. There’s little dimples in the rain, and there are large waves as ships fly overhead. Sometimes there’s these moments where a ship just flies past the still ocean and the water ripples underneath and it’s just so peaceful to watch. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/ed1c6dc533aae2ef315fe07d5e2ff72dcfdff777.jpg In the depths of the ocean and on land there’s these new creatures to discover. I think we’ve gone probably weirder than ever before. When you land on a planet all the tech combines to create an emotion, that feeling of knowing that no one has ever been on this world before. I think it’s what makes this game really special. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/79484b82c5fa889045e581b77efd089061a8d4d2.jpg There’s tonnes of new gameplay too. There’s this huge quest that ties together some strands that we’ve been building for years. We’ve got an expedition that takes you on a tour of all the new worlds that we’re building and it’s got some incredible rewards. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/822fb44b79fab74919f93b983e3dc98ee2191a51.jpg This is our ninth year since release.

It will run for two weeks until 22nd January. Back in September 2024, we launched the Aquarius update, and with it introduced fishing to No Man's Sky, partly because it's just a fun thing to do alone or with friends, but mostly to show off the new water effects which the Worlds Part I update had ushered in a few months before! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/8870a5af72c717292ed7c6f30d47f0494edbaf84.jpg It's fair to say that introducing something as seemingly incongruous as fishing into a sci-fi world has been met with almost universal joy from the community. Clearly there was a pent-up need to pause the exploration, base-building, or adventuring for a while, find a suitable waterside spot, and sit and relax while waiting to see what the catch of the day would be! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/6c30e714843de17e23214855b3e82e06ae13251d.jpg The Aquarius Update also introduced a new waterborne platform, the ExoSkiff which enables you to venture further from the shoreline and fish for bigger catches in deeper waters. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/7e9e399d2af6f8ef98d108fb154cf96dfa32a40a.jpg The Aquarius Expedition which accompanied the update encouraged Travellers to explore the vast array of water expanses the universe had to offer and hone their angling skills in the pursuit of the limited time rewards, not least the Deep Sea diving suit and Aquarius Flight Pack. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/02238973e8eba471eb79d9ee24cad1dec27ef4ef.png {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/e0dadc480a0c9a4711eb9dd8dc8847f443402db8.png These rewards and many more are once again available to claim from today for those who embark on the Aquarius Expedition Redux which runs from the 8th to the 22nd January.

275850,"Feeling ""VERY POSITIVE""","Hello Folks! Last night we finally did it! After eight years, we crossed the 80% positive review threshold on Steam to earn a ""Very Positive"" badge on ""ALL REVIEWS"". Honestly, I didn't think we'd ever do this, and it's all thanks to you all in the community. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We have nearly quarter of a million reviews, so mathematically it's pretty hard to change the % that are positive! For every 10,000 players, maybe 100 review the game. If 80% of those reviews are positive, the first 79 don't change our %, only that 80th person makes a difference! Ten thousands players, resulting in a single extra positive, dropped into an ocean of quarter of a million existing reviews! It gets geometrically harder the higher you climb too - so moving from 70% to 71% took us a month, but moving from 79% to 80% took nearly a year! We figured it might never happen - but it has and it genuinely means so much to us. This year has been particularly busy for our tiny team, with the launch of four major updates: Omega, Orbital, Aquarius and the mammoth Worlds Part I. Most recently we have introduced cross-save to enable players across a huge number of platforms to bring their progress to other devices. We have also run five large expeditions throughout the year, each one packed with unique challenges and exclusive rewards. If you missed out on any of these, we just started a re-run of these over the holidays. No Man's Sky is absolutely our Labor of Love and it would mean the world to us if you've enjoyed any of our work throughout the years, you could pop an ""x"" in our box.

OMEGA, ORBITAL, WORLDS PART I and AQUARIUS added breadth and depth to so many areas of the universe - from a complete overhaul of the expedition system, starship customisation, elaborate new space stations, new planetary biomes, incredible rendering improvements to water and clouds, and so much more. A few weeks ago, we even introduced CROSS-SAVE between our huge number of supported platforms. This year has also seen no fewer than five(!) community expeditions, bringing Travellers together in a certain corner of the universe to experience a themed event and work together to complete unique challenges and earn limited-time exclusive rewards. We know that our players have busy lives, and know more than most that there are other games to play. That’s why, for the last couple of years, it has become customary for the No Man’s Sky team to re-run the expeditions from that year over the holiday period when leisure time is more plentiful, and in a “reduxed” form such that they can be completed and rewards unlocked with relative ease.

275850,"Cross-Save, PS5 Pro and...the return of the Normandy!","Hello, This year has already been a very busy one for No Man’s Sky, with 6 updates already this year, including the huge Worlds Update. Our last update, The Cursed, dropped just a couple of weeks ago, and players have been loving the spooky Halloween vibe. In game development some features take weeks or months, and others take years. Today we are releasing some features that have been years in the making. Cross-Save Starting from today we are rolling out Cross-Save support on all platforms. This has been a huge undertaking, and is one of most requested features. Being able to jump seamlessly between platforms is really transformative. Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy PC rig, and view it in incredibly immersive Virtual Reality. No Man’s Sky now supports Cross-play and Cross-save between a huge number of platforms including PC, PlayStation 4 & Xbox One and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 & 2 and PCVR. Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man’s Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team. It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then! For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all No Man’s Sky players can connect their different platform accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so. PlayStation 5 Pro PlayStation 5 Pro releases today and is an incredible feat of engineering. We were so excited to get our hands on it from early days of development. We couldn’t wait to see what was possible in No Man’s Sky with so much power at our disposal! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/fb6dc77a2177088c825626db56301218e4427f59.jpg We're excited to be able to share an enhanced version of No Man's Sky for PlayStation 5 Pro with players at launch.

No Man's Sky will also be an early supporter of 8k resolution, with the universe looking incredible in 8K at 30fps. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/0464aaa4372a09defcc6c6f88b0d117701b696f0.jpg As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PlayStation 5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board. Players on PlayStation 5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds No Man's Sky has to offer, for the first time on console. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/6f1161602aac2f33f13e970b51198c932c6523d9.jpg Not only this, but all of these improvements also come to PSVR2! With our most stunning virtual reality imagery offering an even more immersive experience for Travellers amongst the stars. The small team at Hello Games like nothing more than to play around with new technology. From supporting our players on first generation hardware, right back to Switch and PlayStation 4, to the highest end PCs, next generation consoles, and now support for cutting edge PlayStation Pro 5 is available at launch as another free update.

Full patch notes can be found here. The Cursed takes place in a sort of twilight realm, straddling the boundary between one reality and the next. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/95c4929a19f4a998614beafc48ddcd6663f2ec95.jpg Travellers will not have access to hyperdrive technology, meaning no warping between star systems.

275850,Introducing Worlds Part I - the 5.0 update,"Hello! I’m here to give you a heads up about the largest No Man’s Sky update of the year so far. So much so that we’ve made the usual trailer, and also this Deep Dive video that shows a glimpse behind the scenes. Our next update is called Worlds Part I, and I’m so proud of the team here, the love they are putting into it. We are refreshing the universe with new technology, new flora, new fauna and new gameplay. Full patch notes can be found here In No Man’s Sky, what you see on screen is generated by the computer. The level of variety we are achieving is far beyond what was possible before. With every update we still want to surprise. Eight years in on this journey and we still want to do big things, and I think we’re adding things the community has almost given up hope on ever happening. It’s not just about new cosmetics for us, we want to really impact No Man’s Sky. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/7ddccb49cff7e575f2ccfc978cfcca27cfa96faf.jpg When we started No Man’s Sky, we wanted people to feel like they had stepped into a science fiction book cover. To bring us closer to that we’ve had to create a lot of new technology. New water technology can create waves, reflections. Oceans that look so different to what we’ve had previously. Ocean planets feel completely new, and ships can now land on water. Planets have wind patterns. Waves are dynamic and react to weather {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/14fde239f751048451a34f406f8cf43c8cc45e99.jpg My favourite thing in the game still might just be flying through the clouds and out into space. Clouds for us are a unique challenge, you see them from space, from planet, you can fly through them. Our new cloud tech creates detailed skies with weather conditions. You get these beautiful detailed skies, with tonnes of variety. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/61c19bb2b80e97ee60d8dcac392ef350fb5962ca.jpg On the surface of the planet we’ve added new volumetrics and atmospherics. Rolling fog, rain, blizzards, lava sparks, combine with wind and clouds. It changes how planets feel to explore, adds so much more life. Sometimes a storm hits, and you see the waves rise and the clouds gather. The new wind, the clouds, the oceans, the atmospherics all hit together and it feels like nothing else. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/c90b2c2c2dd879f55fbbe221e9b212686c4b4dbf.jpg Across these new biomes, we’ve added new creatures to discover. We are pushing the level of variety that’s possible even further. It’s not enough to just add more, we want to do things that people haven’t seen before. And of course, these new creatures can all be pets and mounts. No Man's Sky is a game about exploring, so how planets look and feel is important, but what you do on those planets is something we want to add to with every update. Expeditions have become a huge part of how folks play the game. We’ve made something very Starship Troopers inspired with this one, it’s really different and it takes you on a tour of some of these cool new planets. Everyone is battling against bugs together, and progress is community driven. There’s a new mech with heavy armour and a cool flamethrower arm.

It feels like we’re bringing technology back from the future! Something I love is to browse the screenshots people share with us. I can’t wait to see folks exploring this universe we’ve made with fresh eyes. The update is called Worlds Part I, because I guess obviously…more will follow.

There’s so much we love about the game now, but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe. Going further back I have great memories of early unreleased versions of No Man’s Sky where there were no NPCs, no shops, no help… just you the player as a tiny dot lost in the infinite. For our next update we wanted to allow players to experience an alternative universe. We are calling it ADRIFT, and for the first time players can be truly alone in No Man’s Sky. We think it’s a special feeling. Full details can be found here. Removing other lifeforms means no shops, no trading, no shortcuts and no help, providing a very different survival experience. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/b599c5440a877e7a9284bb14c34ce90c17e3362a.jpg This alternative universe is more dangerous too, with sandworms now roaming free and fiend eggs spreading across planets. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/c0c03bcd85385ec7e2a19f924fa51e14bd7d71a4.jpg Buildings are broken and rusted, the few remaining landmarks the graves of lost Travellers.

We're already two huge updates into the year, with the release of OMEGA - where we invited everyone to try the game for free! - and ORBITAL, which overhauled space stations and introduced a long-requested feature: ship customisation. We are grateful to have such an incredible community; it has been exciting and fascinating to see you all hunting, salvaging and documenting the hundreds of starship components available to assemble your dream ships. We have much, much more planned for 2024. Our journey continues. Sean Adrift Expedition Step into an empty universe, where you will find yourself surrounded by other Travellers… yet somehow still alone. Though everyone will awaken on the desolate, worm-infested planet Iapezuk, you will not be together in the usual sense. The boundaries between realities have thickened. Communication is consumed by static. Even the usually-bustling Space Anomaly is eerily silent. In this forsaken universe, deprived of the usual support from merchants and traders, self-reliance is more critical than ever. Survive a spread of repair, exploration, and combat challenges - and meditate upon the darkness of deep space. Completing this lonely journey will award an exclusive range of collectibles, including the gnawing scuttler companion, a supply of starship stealth paint, a ghostly frigate, and the unique Iron Vulture starship Adrift begins today, and will run for approximately seven weeks. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/f5b3d1ed4674e629e0fd05752007ac9c09501395.png Adrift Expedition Rewards Meditation, Alone in the Dark, and Isolation Posters Contemplate your journey through Adrift with posters that recall the empty endless void of space and the scale of that infinite, black expanse... {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/632d1e939c1770acb3adf992a54fa66c44c792d6.png Stealth Paint An exclusive starship customisation option, creating a unique low-radar-signature look for your ship. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/b219d268ed959eb70fa3deabd546614478212ea4.png Starship Wreckage Base Parts Create a scrapyard aesthetic in habitable bases with these shattered remains of a crashed starship. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/c6c78803d174fd82edc68fa260f6ffacf2b529d7.png Gnawing Scuttler Companion A vile and nightmarish creature, extracted from the derelict shell of a once-glorious freighter.

It’s incredible to watch new folks getting to experience eight years of updates since launch. Today (March 27th) we are releasing our 27th major update - ORBITAL - and this is a big one! Full patch notes can be found here. The Orbital update brings a complete overhaul to Space Stations. Until now these have been perhaps the only part of No Man’s Sky that wasn’t procedurally generated. Engine improvements have allowed us to create vast interior spaces and exterior spaces, with improved reflection and metallic surfaces. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/c6c9088c35b58c7387f94f424b3d2239811e7501.jpg Outside, Space Station exteriors are at a scale never seen before, and are hugely varied. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/a7554adafb4648f314bff85bed68b0bcbee300a3.jpg Inside, Stations have been transformed, and are now vast, procedurally generated, and incredibly diverse. Featuring new shops, gameplay and activities, Stations are now uniquely customised based on system, race and locale. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/660aeb93a987c37dfea9b3e7d751cabf5af48495.jpg Stations also contain perhaps our most requested feature of all time!

In keeping with exploration, to customise their ship, Travellers gather and trade parts for their ships as they explore, salvaging the best components from wrecks and ruins. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/35b860265f142592c9db2ce5e368389f7618e663.jpg We are also introducing a new Guild system, making joining Guilds and increasing reputation a much larger part of the game. Visit new Guild envoys on Space Stations to gain supplies and rare items, or make donations to increase your standing. You can own a freighter and even build up a fleet of frigates in No Man’s Sky. Now you can send that frigate fleet on away missions where if they get into trouble, as frigate captain, you can perform daring rescues. Scramble your squadron of fighters, warp to battles, and engage your attackers. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/d809f06ac07f514a9129e0abf2f6851245f68b88.jpg The Orbital update adds ship customisation, transforms Space Stations inside and out, adds a new guild system, engine improvements, UI refresh and much more.

We have big plans for 2024, and we’re starting the year off with a very different kind of update. We’re calling it OMEGA, and for the first time No Man’s Sky will be available to play for free! Full patch notes here. Expeditions in No Man’s Sky have become one of the most popular ways to play the game. They bring all players together to the same planet for an interstellar, shared experience. This weekend (Thursday 15th to Monday 19th February) we are allowing everyone, whether you own the game or not, to join the Omega Expedition. This represents a moment for new players to try No Man’s Sky, and existing players to welcome them into the community. There are no microtransactions, no free to play mechanics, just a huge universe to explore for free with your friends. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/3d1ab256b41e82018226371aebe65dd81be6fecb.jpg The Omega update also brings a complete overhaul of expeditions, new on-planet missions, a new pirate dreadnought to own, and much more. Until now expeditions have been their own game mode, but we wanted to fully integrate them into our main game. Now, our new expedition system allows travellers to join expeditions with bespoke provisions, bring along their favourite starships or custom multi-tools and return to their main save with loot and exciting rewards. We have revisited the “Atlas Path”, allowing players to commune with the Atlas and honour it with a new Atlas staff, jetpack and helmet. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/f62df850bf97936087fbd9a5fa9103403b773125.jpg On planets we have introduced a huge array of procedurally generated quests. Talking to alien lifeforms results in quests specific to an alien lifeforms locale, climate and personality. For the first time, take on the universe with a fleet of frigates led by a Dreadnought capital ship. If players can defeat pirate freighters in combat, travellers can board the Dreadnought to demand control. At the core of this update is the Omega Expedition, which has been built from the ground up as a perfect introduction for new players, but with some of the best rewards in any expedition to date, including a gorgeous new starship to explore the universe with. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/57faaccdb36d866aa35b02c44814323799abc52d.jpg In the almost eight years since launch, through over 25 free updates, the No Man’s Sky universe has become at times overwhelming in breadth and depth. Through a series of quick missions and milestones, the OMEGA expeditions will guide you through the fundamentals of base-building, trading, space combat, lore and much, much more. Any progress you make will be retained in case you choose to purchase the game and continue your journey. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/f508937095eb9f804dca45eb093fac0c9cea77f0.jpg The Omega Expedition runs for 4 weeks from Thursday 15th February and is free to play for the first weekend until Monday 19th February.

275850,The Next Ten Years,"Hello, Ten years ago we revealed No Man’s Sky to the world, and we feel very lucky to have the opportunity to continue to update this game we love. Next year will be one of our biggest for No Man’s Sky, and we released a video to celebrate at the end of the TGAs, with a small tease of some of the elements coming next year. Next year will be a big one for No Man’s Sky with a lot of updates. It’s been over ten years and we still love working on it. What people don’t know though is that for five of those years we’ve been working on something different and maybe even more ambitious. With No Man’s Sky we created a universe of sparse alien planets, which isn’t easy, but there’s something much harder. For our new game we have created an earth. A planet as varied as a universe, bigger than earth itself. With real mountains, multiple miles tall, that when you climb them and look out you see rivers, canyons, oceans, continents, islands as big as countries. A truly open world. As a kid we always loved the maps at the start of great fantasy books - Earthsea, Narnia, Middle Earth, Westeros - whole worlds. This is our fantasy planet. A single planet we are going to let everyone play on together, to explore and adventure. We’re super nervous but excited when announcing our new game. If folks like it, it’s a game we’d love to be still updating ten years from now. Check out the trailer and wishlist if you like what you see on the Steam page. A little more info… Light No Fire is a game about adventure, building, survival and exploration together. Set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth, it brings the depth of a role playing game to the freedom of a survival sandbox. A Multiplayer Earth Carve a life together. Meet players from across the globe, build a life, explore and survive together. Construct persistent buildings and communities, or strike out alone to discover the world for others. A Procedural Earth A truly open world, with no boundaries at a scale never attempted before. A massively varied and dense planet filled with immersive biomes, unique enemies and valuable resources to discover. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/af5a06a4433884538965f4b23cbb3eca14532701.jpg A Fantasy Earth Light No Fire presents you with an ancient earth to uncover. One where you're not the hero. Thick with lore, mystery and a constant fight for survival. Inspired by the adventure, charm and imagination that we love from classic fantasy. An Unexplored Earth Every mountain can be climbed, and below them lie endless vistas, oceans and continents perhaps no others have seen. Who will climb the tallest mountains, who will find the deepest sea? Set sail across vast oceans and rivers, ride wild beasts through fantastical landscapes, fly dragons over undiscovered landscapes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/8c2c27bc3c8bf3ffee6b4cf84978b00b343d028d.jpg We hope that you will continue to enjoy the No Man’s Sky journey and consider joining us on a new adventure. Your support means the world to us. Thanks. Sean ",1702570376,
275850,No Man's Sky is bringing back its 2023 expeditions for the holiday season,"<strong>No Man's Sky</strong> is giving you a great reason to jump back into it over the holidays, as <strong>Hello Games</strong> is bringing back several expeditions for a limited time. Most fans of Hello Games are probably focused on the developer's next game, Light No Fire, which was <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire"">just revealed at The Game Awards last week</a>, but that doesn't mean that No Man's Sky is out for the count. Over on the official No Man's Sky website, a <a href=""https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/12/holiday-2023-expeditions/"">blog post</a> was posted sharing that 2023's community expeditions will be available to play once again over the holidays, the first of which has already kicked off. While it started last week, you'll still be able to play the Utopia community event right up to December 15. As a reminder, this one sees you working with other players to ""rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation."" Then starting on December 15, running until December 22, Singularity will be available to play through once again. ""Begin to unveil the history and origin of the harmonic camps in this precursor to Echoes,"" reads a description of the event. ""A mystery that touches upon artificial intelligence, the will to exist, and the very nature of what it means to be alive.""

275850,2023 Expedition Holiday Redux,"Hello Everyone! Another busy year for No Man’s Sky is drawing to a close, and this holiday season we are pleased to revisit our tradition of running remixed editions of this year’s expeditions. Across the following dates, 2023’s community expeditions will be available once more, taking place in new sections of the universe, offering explorers another opportunity to experience these stories and events and earn exclusive rewards. In addition to the 2023 expeditions, we are also bringing back a limited run of the community favourite Cartographers, from 2021. The bundle of rewards includes some of the most popular items from across a number of past expeditions, including the coveted Golden Vector starship – an exciting opportunity for players who missed out on the chance to earn these rewards during the original expedition runs. Utopia: 8th Dec – 15th Dec Work together with other Travellers to rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation. Utopia welcomes all contributors to our ambitious new communal habitation project! Singularity: 15th Dec – 22nd Dec Begin to unveil the history and origin of the harmonic camps in this precursor to Echoes. A mystery that touches upon artificial intelligence, the will to exist, and the very nature of what it means to be alive. Cartographers: 22nd Dec – 29th Dec Awaken stranded on the fiery planet of Coul Major, and deeply explore its surface as you work to repair your bespoke starship. Voyagers: 29th Dec – 8th Jan A relaxing journey of exploration, encouraging Travellers to seek out remarkable worlds, reach planetary summits and oceanbeds, and catalogue your findings. Rewards for the 2023 expeditions include the Robo-Warden and HoverDroid Companions, the Fearsome Visor and Wayfarer’s Helm, the Crimson Freighter Trail, and much more. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/3c47591044c2c6e019082d31d1903bf373e3479f.png Cartographers presents some of the most exciting and popular rewards from previous expeditions: the Jetpack Bubble Trail, Feasting Casque, Exotic Wingpack, Streamlined Jetpack, and the legendary Golden Vector starship. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/bb401f0fce2fd82a239e16c4a0e6d322ec2a541d.png Left-Handed VR Today’s expedition update includes a bonus feature that we have been wanting to implement for a long time: left-handed mode for motion controls in virtual reality. VR players may now toggle their preferred handedness between left and right. The handedness setting in VR links your grip on the Multi-Tool, interactions with menus, selection and placement of base building objects to the dominant hand, while attaching the wrist menu to the secondary hand, allowing left-handed players a more comfortable and intuitive experience. This year we celebrated 7 years of post-launch development and support for No Man’s Sky and 10 years almost to the day since we announced the game to the world at the Game Awards (VGX). It is overwhelming to look back at how much the game has grown since 2016 – and to look ahead to where it is going. We’re excited to share a little taste of what’s yet to come! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/7950629a9cce82643f1268361b7acf6561fd6d58.png Nintendo Switch Visual Quality Another feature in today’s update that we wanted to highlight: the rendering clarity on Switch has enjoyed further improvements. When we added FSR 2 on Switch in ECHOES, we were so happy to see the positive response from players and press (“With the recent patches, No Man’s Sky is now one of the cleanest, most visually stable games on Nintendo’s hardware.” – Eurogamer), and we’re pleased to be able to expand on that. In particular, with today’s update, Switch players will experience a reduction of ghosting artifacts – visual noise that can linger on screen when the image moves – and an overall improvement to image sharpness, via a highly bespoke implementation of AMD FidelityFX’s Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS), customised to perform optimally on Switch. Community Research The Quicksilver Synthesis Companion has working continuously throughout the year, powered by Travellers completing missions available at The Nexus. Their current synthesis project is a trio of cargo-themed base parts: an industrial crane as well as covered crates and silos, whose contents may well be of Outlaw provenance… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/9164327/894943a1eb71a30347ca3d505e2189e0e6d45236.png Global community progress towards unlocking these exclusive decorations can be viewed in the Mission Log, at the Quicksilver Bot’s kiosk, or at the Galactic Atlas site.
