3164500,Schedule I x Youtooz Charity Collab,"Hey everyone,We're doing our first-ever official merchandise drop - Schedule I x Youtooz! Three collectible figures are now available to order:Uncle NelsonJessi WatersBenji ColemanI'm happy to say that 100% of TVGS's share of revenue will be donated to charity: SSDP Australia (Students for Sensible Drug Policy). SSDP does excellent work on drug policy reform and harm minimisation, and it's an honour to be able to contribute to their cause.Otherwise, the Shrooms update is nearing completion - I'm expecting it to be ready for open beta testing next week, and the full release not long after that. Thanks for your patience with this update. There's lots of cool new stuff coming, and I've also snuck in some handy QoL improvements and bug fixes. Thanks for reading,Tyler",1765310738,
3164500,Patch v0.4.1f12,"Hey everyone,This patch delivers a number of bug fixes and tweaks, particularly for multiplayer. I've spent the past two weeks rewriting a bunch of yucky code to make it less error-prone and easier for me to work with in the future. You likely won't notice any significant changes, but behind the scenes, things are a lot tidier now!I wasn't originally anticipating doing this patch before the Shrooms update, but I thought it'd be best to do some 'cleaning' and bug fixing before more content is introduced. Because of this, there's a good chance the Shrooms update will be pushed back into early-mid December, sorry. As always, I'll try my best to get it done on time, but I want to acknowledge the possibility of a delay sooner rather than later.AdditionsAdded a network replication queue system, which staggers the data being sent whenever a player joins a multiplayer game.Added an optional quest entry to the 'Deal for the Benzies' quest advising the player how to break the truce.Tweaks/ImprovementsRefactored a lot of networking code to minimise bandwidth usage.Refactored how visuals are applied to mixed products in different states (unpackaged, baggie, jar, stored, equipped, etc). The old system was way too brittle and needed to be cleaned up before another drug type was added.Cleaned up a variety of product meshes, combining separate meshes into one where possible.Actions against the cartel now lower influence a bit faster, making it less tedious to unlock new regions.Moved the vehicle color code to a separate, dedicated script. This has allowed me to replace all the static, decorative vehicles around the map with simplified versions that don't contain a bunch of unused scripts and components.Modified how vehicles apply colors to avoid unnecessary instantiation of new materials.Tweaked vehicle sounds.Refactored how vehicles decide if they should currently be physically simulated or not.Adjusted the friction properties of vehicle wheels when the handbrake is applied, making it a bit more effective at bringing vehicles to a stop.Enabled physics for post boxes. Bug fixesFixed bagged meth and coke using the wrong consume animation.Cartel dealers no longer send 'inventory depleted' notifications to the player.Fixed the cartel deal quest UI not reactivating.Fixed merchant dialogue sometimes not working for non-host players.Fixed purchased cars spawning in mid-air.Fixed the main volume mixer failing to silence in-game sounds while the loading screen is active.Fixed the lag spike that occurred as the loading screen closed.Fixed vehicle wheels not spinning for non-host players in multiplayer.Fixed Jessi never being selected as the random sewer key possessor. Fixed skateboard and vehicle inputs not working when you have rebound the main movement keys (WASD) to something else.The player no longer gets XP for deals completed by cartel dealers.Fixed customers being listed several times in the customer selection menu for dealers.Fixed a missing collider in Stash & Dash.Fixed drying rack management UI mislabelling.Fixed non-host graffiti not lowering cartel influence in multiplayer.Fixed missing font and incorrect text color in the vehicle repaint interface.Fixed a multiplayer bug where removing an item from a slot and quickly inserting another would cause the item to disappear.Fixed some null reference errors that happen when a player leaves the game while wanted or in combat.Fixed police sometimes not noticing non-host players breaking curfew.Fixed dead/unconscious cartel goons respawning and standing around doing nothing after a day passes.Fixed NPC behaviour/schedule update methods not running at 4 am.Thanks for reading,Tyler",1763454373,['patchnotes']
3164500,v0.4.1: Halloween Update,"Hey everyone,The Halloween update is here! This update adds a new sewer system under the Hyland Point. You'll need to get ahold of a sewer access key to get down there. The sewers offer a new way to navigate Hyland Point without having to worry about police and cartel members, but it isn't without it's risks...There's a new ladder system which opens up a bit more vertical navigation - these ladders can be found in the sewers, as well as on several buildings around the map.There's also been some work done towards optimization. Most of this work is in the form of small tweaks and reworks, but it should all add up to provide a decent (10-15%) boost framerate.Sorry this update is a couple of days late - I was originally planning on skipping the open beta and going straight to full release. At the last minute released I should probably play it safe and publicly beta test it for at least a day.Additions Added sewer system.Added climbing system.Added ladders to various buildings.Added sewer maintenace office property.Added sewer access key.Added 2x1m plastic table.Added trash crown.Added garbage throne.Added water step sound.Added 'sewer king' NPC.Added 'sewer goblin' NPC.Added meth LODs.Added new 'replication queue' system to help stagger network traffic when a player joins a multiplayer game.Added loading dock to west Gas-Mart.Added 5 more graffiti locations. Tweaks/Improvements Refactored the environmental FX and post-processing system to support transitioning between different visual zones.Changed fog color and density to be controlled by day-night timeline instead of a basic curve/gradient.Tweaked occlusion settings for more aggressive culling.Tweaked shadow cascades.Tweaked various LODs.Disabled vehicle FixedUpdate calculations when vehicle is static.Optimized compass rendering.Disabled a light optimization technique that wasn't actually providing any performance improvement.Changed a lot of calculations to be on-demand instead of every frame.Disabled additional light shadows when quality is set yo medium or below.Changed various cooldowns to use global time (Time.timeSinceLevelLoad) instead of manual time tracking.Removed unnecessary update loops from a number of scripts.Replaced some MeshColliders with primitive colliders.Cached animation string hashes on start instead of recalculating on use.Turned off shadows for a bunch of small objects.Tweaked graffiti surfaces to only generate texture data when required instead of when the game starts. This was causing a ~1s hitch and unnecessary memory allocation whenever loading a game.Reorganised the structure of the main scene. This shouldn't have any visible impact but makes my job easier in the future :) Bug fixes Fixed police global vision events not working properly (this allows police to 'share' their knowledge of where a wanted player is.Fixed a bug where NPCs would shoot at the player even when not visible.Fixed some duplicate GUIDs.Fixed police officer vision getting bugged if killed while searching for the player.Fixed 'cuke effects' and 'energy drink effects' utility items being usable in item slot filters.Fixed not being able to pickpocket unconscious NPCs if you have recently failed a pickpocket.Fixed null reference error that occurred when inserting cash into a storage entity.Remove some unnecessary Player.log spam. I've discovered that a lot of the connection issues in multiplayer are likely due to bandwidth limits being exceeded - I've made an effort in this update to mitigate this, but there's still some more work to do. This will be my focus for the next week or two, and a patch for this will be releasing before the Shrooms update.Thanks for reading, and happy (late) Halloween!Tyler",1762119597,

Drivers came in second with 139,000 votes, and fishing received 85,000 votes. Shrooms will be the fourth drug type added to the game, and will have a totally new and unique production process.

This is releasing about a month later than I originally intended - due to a variety of factors, but mostly me underestimating the amount of work involved in implementing certain features, as well as me deciding to add more stuff (graffiti, pump shotgun, etc) at the last minute. I've also been moving house and getting through my University exams - safe to say it's been a hectic couple of months!Thanks for your patience as I've gotten this update wrapped up.

3164500,"v0.3.6: Filters, Employee Tweaks, Save System Improvements","Hi everyone,I'm happy to say v0.3.6 is now finally fully released! This update includes new item slot filters, which will allow you to tell your employees which items you want or don't want in a particular slot. Employee beds have been replaced with space-saving lockers (although you can still use beds if you really want to!), and I've rewritten a large chunk of the saving system, which should dramatically improve saving times and make Steam cloud syncs much more speedy and reliable. Apologies, this update has taken a bit longer than usual - it's been a hectic past few weeks. I was in surgery for wisdom teeth removal about 2 weeks ago, I have had to spend quite a lot of time recording/documenting the game for AU classification, I'm back to uni this week, and I've been dealing with some other things going on behind the scenes. Nevertheless, I'm excited to get back into the swing of things and get to work on the first major Schedule I update.Speaking of which, I've been setting up the infrastructure needed for the community voting system, and I'm happy to say everything is now in place. We'll be running the first vote this coming week - you'll see a prompt to vote in the main menu as soon as the voting period opens. Additions Added lockers. These will be replacing employee beds. For compatibility reasons, employees will still be assigned to beds in existing saves, but going forward, you can use lockers instead, which are more space-efficient and can store more stuff. Added item slot filters. You can now set whitelists or blacklists on slots to tell employees which items should or shouldn't go in a particular slot. Added employee property transfers. Tweaks/Improvements Increased storage unit employee capacity to 3. Consolidated all NPC save files. Consolidated property save files. Consolidated business save files. Changed the trash can pickup area to be square instead of circular. The trash can pickup area is now visible while you're placing the trash can. Bug fixes Fixed occasional NPC long-distance pathing failures. Fixed occasional employee pathing failures. Fixed employees sometimes attempting to pick up items that they don't have the inventory capacity for. Fixed botanist-related performance issue. Fixed police showing question marks above their heads while they're unconscious. Fixed viewmodel drifting. Fixed an incorrect statement regarding how dealers are unlocked. Thank you, everyone!!

In the meantime, here's a new patch for the open beta: Additions Added the following options to the new filter configuration menu: Copy filter Paste filter Apply filter to sibling slots Clear filter Tweaks/Improvements Employee lockers now have a slight colour differentiation depending on the type of assigned employee.

3164500,v0.3.6 Open Beta,"Hey everyone, You can now try out the latest update on the beta branch. Check out the full changelist below. Important note for this beta This beta includes the final phase of the save file consolidation effort (replacing lots of little save files with a few big ones). NPCs and properties now save entirely under a single file, which means saving will be a lot faster, and Steam cloud syncing should finally work properly. In case of any bugs, please be sure to make a backup of your save game before playing it on this beta. You can use the export/import buttons in the main menu to do this easily. For a guide to changing game branches on Steam, see this video. Additions Added lockers. These will be replacing employee beds. For compatibility reasons, employees will still be assigned to beds in existing saves, but going forward, you can use lockers instead, which are more space-efficient and can store more stuff.

I'm in the process of setting up an in-game voting system, and will likely run the first vote next week. When it's active, you'll be able to vote on what you want to see in the next major update.

3164500,"v0.3.5: Jukebox, Storage Unit","Hey everyone, This update adds a brand new purchasable Jukebox. This Jukebox can play any of the 19 tracks in the OST, as well as 8 brand new Jukebox tracks composed by KAESUL. There's also a new storage unit property at the north end of the overpass. I've also started consolidating a number of save files to hopefully improve save/load times and Steam Cloud Sync reliability. Additions Added jukebox. Purchaseable from Bleuball's boutique for $1500. Added storage unit property. Added save export feature. Added save import feature. Tweaks/Improvements Consolidated a number of individual safe files into larger combined files. This should improve save times and work a bit better with Steam Cloud Sync. Bug fixes Fixed loading docks being unselectable at the barn and the docks warehouse. Fixed online balance being $100 on a fresh save. I'm hard at work on the next update. It'll include a number of improvements to the employees, including: Replacing employee beds with lockers. Item slot filters - used to indicate which items you want to be in different slots. Transferring employees between properties. Changing trash can pickup area from circular to square. Fixing any remaining employee logic/pathfinding bugs. Stay tuned! I'll probably stream some of this work on my Twitch. Thanks for reading, Tyler",1746683215,

3164500,Patch v0.3.4f8,"Tweaks/Improvements You can now access the inventory of your employees by talking to them and selecting 'I need to access your inventory'. Added some new graffiti art. Broken vending machines and ATMs will now repair after only a single sleep (previously it took 2 days). Removed the optional email from the feedback form. This was rarely used and mostly just unnecessary clutter. Renamed suggestions -> feedback in the feedback form. Consolidated a number of saved entities into larger, combined files. This should improve save time, reliability, be less prone to bugs, and improve Steam Cloud sync time. The following types of entities were consolidated: your mixes, vending machines, ATMs, store pallets, and dead drops. Bug fixes Fixed chemists sometimes causing cauldrons to become unusable. Fixed botanists sometimes causing drying racks to become unusable. Fixed NPC summoning not working on Mick's house. Fixed some issues in Mick's schedule that may have been the cause of him sometimes not appearing at the pawn shop. Fixed the first 'escape' button click being ignored. Fixed OG Kush being listed for sale by default in a fresh save. Fixed save game version label alignment. Fixed items in pallets, dead drops, etc sometimes persisting across different saves files. Fixed ATM/Vending machine being unusable, but not visually broken after exiting and reloading the game. More bug fixes and refinements coming next week ːsteamhappyː And more content coming after that - I'm planning to introduce a new property as well as a new purchaseable jukebox/radio object.

This update includes a functional pawn shop, boutique store, wall decorations, and more! Check out the full patch list below. Sorry the update is a bit later than expected - I'm still ironing out the update/testing process. Things will be running a lot smoother (and on time) when I do larger monthly updates (starting next month). Additions Added Bleuballs Boutique interior and functionality. Added Pawn Shop interior and functionality. You can now sell pretty much anything (excluding product) to Mick at the pawn shop. Added wooden sign. Added metal sign. Added wall-mounted shelf. Added safe. Added antique wall lamp. Added modern wall lamp. Added grandfather clock. Added Ol' Man Jimmy's Whiskey. Liquor is decorative for the time being but will become functional in a future update. Added Château La Peepee. Added Brut du Gloop. Added silver watch. Added gold watch. Added silver chain. Added gold chain. Added gold bar. Added 6 different paintings for you to collect. Added toilet (pre-owned). Added golden toilet. Tweaks/Improvements Improved the counteroffer product selection interface. Improved phrasing for customer recommendation dialogue. Increased jar stack size to 20. Added some extra null checks and validity checks. Supplier meeting icons in the map app now include the supplier's name. Removed the cooldown timer for requesting a meeting with a supplier. Time skips (e.g. sleeping) now affect the supplier meeting countdown. Bug fixes Fixed delivery destination dropdown overflowing outside of phone screen. Fixed player lists sometimes not clearing properly when exiting to menu. Fixed non-host clients sometimes not receiving 'on day pass' and 'on week pass' events. Fixed a bug where item slot filters could be bypassed by swapping items. My next focus will be on taking care of any remaining bugs. My top priorities are: Making sure employees are working consistently and without issue. Preventing save games getting corrupted/disappearing. I've met with some folks at Valve and got some great insight into how I can improve the save file format so that it plays a bit nicer with Steam Cloud saves, as well as being less prone to corruption. Minimizing disconnections and loading issues in multiplayer. I'm also looking into improving optimization. I'd like to get Steam Deck officially supported as soon as possible, so that'll act as my performance benchmark. Thanks for reading, Tyler",1744269720,

My approach for this update (and all future updates) will be to test it on the beta branch for a day or two and then release it fully. Anyone can opt into the beta branch to test this update. For a guide to changing game branches on Steam, check out this video. This beta doesn't quite contain 100% of the features coming in the full release - I'll be adding a few more decorative objects tomorrow. I wanted to get this beta out ASAP so that the new wall-mounted objects and pawn shop interface can be thoroughly trialled. Additions Added Bleuballs Boutique interior and functionality.

3164500,Post-launch Patch #6 + Alternate Version,"Hey everyone, Hey everyone, here's the 6th post-launch patch. I've fixed a number of bugs and made a couple of minor tweaks. I've also created what I'm calling the alternate version of the game for anyone who is experiencing crashes. You can read more below. Alternate version The alternate version is identical to the normal version, except it uses a different scripting backend (Mono instead of IL2CPP). This scripting backend isn't quite as performant as the normal version, but it generally handles errors a bit better and is less prone to crashing. If you're experiencing consistent crashes in the default version, I'd recommend trying it out. You can opt into the alternate version the same way as switching to the beta version - a video tutorial can be viewed here. If people find that the alternate version results in fewer crashes, I'll continue to maintain this version and keep it updated to match the default version. Even if the alternate version doesn't fix the crashing, it'll at least send me bug reports with more info compared to the default version. Additions Added alternate version. Added 'cleartrash' command. Useful if you're experiencing performance drops due to lots of trash items. Tweaks/Improvements Chemists can now be assigned up to 4 stations (up from 3). Bug fixes Fixed mixing colliders behind the Slop Shop. Fixed not being able to knock on the door of the tall building next to the overpass. Fixed player speed multiplier not resetting after exiting and reloading. Fixed warehouse NPCs not returning to their jobs after attacking the player. Fixed employees being able to be assigned to stuff at other properties. Fixed being able to pick up items while on a skateboard. Thanks for reading, Tyler",1743724128,['patchnotes']

3164500,Post-launch Patch #5,"Hey everyone, I hope you've had a great weekend! The 5th post-launch patch is here. In this patch, I've fixed a number of employee bugs, multiplayer bugs, and casino bugs. I've also implemented a number of pathfinding validity checks to hopefully prevent a lot of crashes. Tweaks/Improvements Added an active display setting to choose which monitor the game displays on. Botanists will now automatically move product from their supplies to drying racks. Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app. Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention). Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter. Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance. Bug fixes Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack. Fixed a quest UI bug that was sometimes causing infinite loading screens in multiplayer. Fixed clipboard selections not reassigning without first manually clearing the existing selection (employee beds, botanist supplies, etc). Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack. Fixed first-person jacket looking janky. Fixed 'Master Chef' achievement being rewarded prematurely. Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues. The drying rack 'dry' button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee. Fixed NPC 'stay in building' behaviour sometimes causing errors for non-host players. Fixed NPC voiceover emitters sometimes throwing a null reference. I've started work on the first content update and am planning to release it this weekend. I'll be posting some sneak peeks soon - stay tuned! Thanks for reading, Tyler",1743485291,['patchnotes']

3164500,Post-launch Patch #4,"Hey everyone, The 4th post-launch patch is here. In this update, I've fixed a number of employee bugs and multiplayer issues. There have been a few saving/loading issues, and I think this is primarily due to Windows permissions preventing Schedule I from writing files during the save process. As far as I know, this only occurs for a relatively small percentage of players. To help detect and fix this issue, I've created a system that will detect when there is a file writing permissions issue and display a pop-up in the main menu that provides instructions to resolve the issue. Tweaks/Improvements Added write permissions auto checker. Added automatic bug reporting for multiplayer join fails. Added a bug report category for employees. A bug report is now automatically submitted if it takes more than 90 seconds to load into a multiplayer game. Product names are now made file-safe before attempting to save. Bug fixes Fixed a number of employee pathfinding bugs. Fixed a bug involving employees sometimes not being able to place items if the destination is almost at full capacity. Fixed vehicle trunks duplicating items. Added a check to prevent duplicated text in the management clipboard. Fixed a number of janky colliders in the post office. Fixed 'I'm stuck' button not working in the prologue. Thank you for reading! Tyler",1743227331,['patchnotes']
3164500,Post-launch Patch #3,"Hey everyone, Here's the 3rd post-launch patch for Schedule I. I've a number of bugs and added the option to include your save file with your in-game bug report. This will allow me to track down and fix issues much faster than previously possible. Tweaks/Improvements Added 'include save file' option to the in-game bug reporting tool (ticked by default). Added more categories to choose from when reporting a bug. 'Include screenshot' is no longer ticked by default when selecting a bug. Bug fixes Fixed employees sometimes placing non-applicable items into the ingredient slot of mixing machines. Some position checks were added for employees to prevent invalid position assignments. I believe this was having a knock-on effect and causing a few other bugs. Fixed null NPC element in a list causing a black screen when sleeping. Fixed trash bag contents disappearing on save/load. Increased client timeout threshold to 30s - this should allow for clients to receive all necessary data when loading into a late-game save without timing out. The internal 'brick' item is no longer created when unpackaging a brick at a packaging station. Fixed a misspelling in a supplier message. Added some more validity checks to stored items, preventing other resultant bugs. Fixed businesses, sometimes adding themselves to the 'owned businesses' list several times, which caused some other bugs. Fixed NPCs entering/exiting Randy's Bait & Tackle incorrectly. Added some null checks to handler transit routes. If you're experiencing any bugs that haven't yet been fixed, don't worry - releasing daily patches will be my top priority until the game is stable for everyone. I really appreciate all the bug reports I've been getting - they genuinely do help me out a lot. Unfortunately, I can't personally reply to most reports, but I promise all major issues will be addressed as quickly as possible. Thank you for reading! Tyler",1743111652,['patchnotes']
3164500,Post-launch Patch #2,"Hey everyone, Here's the 2nd post-launch patch for Schedule I. I've addressed a number of bugs in this update. You can check out the full list below. Bug fixes Fixed chemists not being able to use the Mixing Station Mk2. Items are no longer picked up when aiming at them with a gun. Fixed pots sometimes not being filled by the soil pourer. Fixed an Uncle Nelson phone call which incorrectly stated that the Chinese restaurant room costs $500. Fixed stations/pots not being unassigned from employees when picked up. Fixed botanists getting stuck trying to pick up an item that has been removed from their supplies. Fixed 'Zombifying' effects not clearing properly. Fixed player appearance reverting after getting a haircut or tattoo. Fixed NPCs walking through some vehicles. Fixed UI getting bugged out by other players using a management clipboard. Fixed non-host players exiting to the menu when having their vehicle searched at a checkpoint. The player should now be searched by the closest officer at a checkpoint. Fixed an employee configuration error that I believe was causing black screens when sleeping. Fixed employees not uninitializing themselves, causing a number of other bugs. Fixed a bug causing chemists to make mixing stations unusable. Fixed chemist animation not looping properly. Apologies to anyone who has experienced any bugs - I'm going to continue releasing daily post-launch patches until all major issues are taken care of.

3164500,Post-Launch Patch #1,"Hey everyone, This is a small patch to address the debt problem (-2 billion dollars bug).

3164500,"v0.2.9: New Ambient Music, Optimization, Map Additions","Hello everyone, This update adds a brand new afternoon ambient music track, courtesy of my friend KAESUL, who has also composed the rest of the Schedule I OST. You can check out KAESUL on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. I've added an interior to the clothing store (though keep in mind clothes can only be bought in the full game) and added more detail to Taco Ticklers. I've also made a number of improvements that should hopefully get you a few extra frames and minimize memory usage. Additions Added a new afternoon ambient music track. Added 'Thrifty Threads' clothing store. Added some signage to the pharmacy. Added more interior decoration to Taco Ticklers. Tweaks/Improvements Rank-ups now happen after the daily summary when you sleep, rather than during gameplay. Limited max concurrent deployed police vehicles to 5. Made police a bit easier to escape. Simplified the 'view friend of unlocked customer' part of the 'On the Grind' quest. Fixed 'product must be packaged' warning not working.

I've also fixed a number of bugs and made some optimizations. Additions Added Mixing Station MK II.

3164500,"v0.2.7: More Effects, Mixing Changes","Hey all, This week brings 4 new effects - paranoia, sneaky, disorienting, and spicy. I've also reworked the mixing algorithm so that it's a bit more logical and easier to configure and expand upon on my end. A new ingredient has also been added. I've also implemented several improvements to the existing effects. Why rework the mixing algorithm? The existing mixing system worked using a bunch of arbitrary numbers, and adding them together to determine if an existing effect can transform into a new effect. It was too random, overcomplicated and didn't feel like it followed any logical rules. The new algorithm I've designed the new system to allow me to easily define which effects are similar to other effects (e.g. energizing is similar to athletic, balding to gingeritis, etc) so that mixing operations are a bit more logical. It's still mostly trial and error but should be a bit more predictable. Is this going to mess with my existing mixes? No - the new system is set up to preserve any mix recipes you've already created. Additions Added paranoia, sneaky, disorienting, and spicy effects. Added camera bob settings. Added barbershop and tattoo parlour interiors. Added overalls to the character creator. Tweaks/Improvements Improved a number of existing effects. Rewrote the mixing algorithm for more consistency, logic, and extensibility. Changed the appearance of Anna and Peggy to make them a bit more visually distinct. Changed the offline networking transport. Product names are now generated deterministically, meaning everyone should get the same suggested name for the same combination of ingredients. Improved ingredient detection in mixing station bowl. The demo boundaries are now one-way, so if you somehow find yourself outside of the demo playable area, you won't be stuck there. You can no longer offer a deal to a customer while they're already waiting for a deal to be completed. Bug fixes Fixed ragdolls distorting. Fixed impact sounds sometimes not playing. Fixed vehicles sometimes glitching into the ground. Fixed 'view on map' being inconsistent with 'show on map'. Thanks for reading! Tyler",1738459590,
3164500,v0.2.6: Packaging Station Mk II,"Hi everyone, This week I'm adding a new upgraded packaging station. It can be purchased for $750 from Dan's Hardware after you've reached Hoodlum V. It features a rotating conveyor belt that is used to position the packaging under a nozzle. The product is then dropped into the packaging, and the packaging is automatically sealed. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45158368/817e44952b7e5c1871fdcfd2a3c503b741d6656b.png Additions Added Packaging Station Mk II.

3164500,v0.2.5: Customer Improvements,"Hi everyone, I'm hard at work on the full game, but I'm still planning to do weekly updates for the demo up until next month. In this update, I've added a couple of new ways to interact with customers. Desperate Customers If a customer hasn't had a deal for a while, and they've built up a certain level of addiction, they'll come find you and ask for a deal on the spot. You can either agree to make a deal, ask them to follow you while you grab some product, or reject them. If you reject an addicted and violent customer, they might attack you! Instant Offers You can now approach any of your customers and ask them on the spot if they'd like to make a deal. If they haven't bought anything for a while, and you have a good enough relationship, they'll agree to make a deal. You can choose what to sell and set an asking price. Depending on the quality of the deal, they'll complete the deal or call it off. Additions Added desperate customer requests. Added instant offers. Added message delete button. The conversation will be hidden until a new message is received. Tweaks/Improvements Pot fill percentage is now shown while pouring soil. Replaced the 3D hazmat suit with a 2D avatar texture. It's pretty much visually identical but should be a bit more performant and will prevent clipping issues. Reduced NPC type label in the messages app. Added bed to Gas-Mart. This is to prevent soft-locking if you don't have a bed at night after the hardware store is closed. Modified in-game bug reporting tool to include previous session logs. Police will now let each other know if they spot the target. Bug fixes Fixed Cash for Trash machines in co-op. Fixed counter-offer price selector sometimes not working properly. Fixed harvested weed buds reappearing after exiting and reloading. Fixed mixing station breaking when two stations complete the same new mix at the same time. Fixed non-host clients still having counter-offer message responses after rejection. Fixed non-client client inventories sometimes not loading correctly on rejoin. Fixed a rare issue where using a VPN would cause singleplayer not to load correctly. Fixed some police car chase AI bugs. Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for another update next week - I'm planning to add an upgraded packaging station. Tyler",1737261619,

In this version, I've changed how you communicate with Uncle Nelson in the demo quests. Rather than receiving a call on your mobile phone from Uncle Nelson, you can call him at a payphone whenever you're ready to talk to him.
