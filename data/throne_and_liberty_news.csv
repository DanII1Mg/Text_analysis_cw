2429640,Dimensional Trials Revamp,"Our ultimate goal is to transform Dimensional Trials from an exclusive challenge for top-tier players into a feature that everyone can gradually grow into and enjoy together. This is not just about adjusting difficulty, it's the result of a structural redesign that takes into account the growth and experience of each individual player. We want to ensure that Dimensional Trials live up to their name — a deeply immersive experience where each player can take on challenges in their own way, compare their performance, and grow from it.More Rewards, less RepetitionTo start, Tier 1 now maintains a difficulty level similar to that of standard co-op dungeons, but with enhanced rewards. This allows players to jump in without pressure and still feel a sense of achievement from the rewards alone, even in the early stages.While the content retains its replayable structure, each trial is now built with strategic variety through affixes and specific conditions, offering more than just repetition. Players familiar with co-op dungeons can now learn through actual gameplay without needing perfect knowledge beforehand, making for a more intuitive, hands-on approach to mastery.An ideal level of difficulty is one where both the possibility of success and the risk of failure coexist. It’s a point where players can create meaningful differences in outcomes through their own choices, combinations, and playstyle. We want to foster a structure where this naturally leads to a sense of accomplishment and healthy competition.Affix System ChangesEach trial round now offers unique affixes and challenge conditions, requiring players to adapt their strategies. Each attempt is designed to feel like a self-contained, rewarding experience. One of the biggest shifts is that the affix system is now central to the content’s design. Affixes don’t just increase difficulty, they encourage players to think critically about which weapon and role combinations are most effective.This naturally enhances both the strategic depth and variety of party play. The shorter the clear time, the more difficult affixes you select, the fewer times you die, and the more affix monsters you defeat, the higher your score will be. The new system evaluates how efficiently players clear challenges under the same conditions. It’s no longer just about who is on top. It’s also about reflecting on your own gameplay and optimizing your approach for the next attempt.That said, we haven’t removed replayability entirely. For players who enjoy repetition, there are still pathways to engage with the content, but we’ve reworked the reward structure to move beyond rune-focused incentives. Now, repeated runs offer more meaningful opportunities for growth.More than just a Revamp of a Single Piece of ContentDimensional Trials serve as a platform to explore and establish the future direction of PvE-focused competitive structures we aim to pursue.The most noticeable change for players will be the need to adopt different strategies and compositions with each attempt, even when repeating the same content. Moreover, those outcomes are now recorded through objective metrics and performance tracking. This design shifts the focus from simply whether a challenge is cleared to how it’s cleared. It’s a deliberate change in how we shape the player experience.We’ve also built this new structure with scalability in mind. Elements such as affix-based conditional content, reward scaling based on challenge conditions, and maintaining strategic depth within a repeatable format are all systems we believe can be applied to a variety of environments.While Dimensional Trials are competitive in nature, they are open to everyone. It is a space where the challenge lies not in simply entering, but in how effectively you can solve the content using your own approach. We hope this update becomes the first step in evolving Dimensional Trials into a system that rewards both creativity and mastery.Thanks for your support! We’ll see you in the new Dimensional Trials on September 18.",1757615844,

2429640,Battlegrounds and Stonegard Siege Map Rework,"Capture objectives, wipe out enemy players, and complete special missions to dominate the battleground in a new 24v24 mode. However, Battleground isn’t the only new PvP update coming in the Solisium’s Awakening update on September 18. Alongside a behind the scenes discussion on Battlegrounds, NCSOFT is also excited to share more about the development of the Castle Siege map rework.BattlegroundsLearning from Players and FamiliarityOur goal was to create PvP content that involved a broader range of players compared to existing THRONE AND LIBERTY PvP modes. Currently, some high-end PvP content is only accessible to players who meet certain conditions. With Battlegrounds, we wanted to capture the fun and excitement of those experiences while lowering the barrier to entry.We drew inspiration from the various PvP styles that TL players already enjoy, combining them to shape this new mode. Part of that was playing existing PvP content and closely observing player behavior. That led us to believe that a more accessible PvP mode like Battlegrounds was something TL truly needed.Initially, we felt that familiarity was key. We considered directly applying TL’s existing dominion mode rules. However, we realized that for a new PvP experience, familiarity alone wouldn't be enough to deliver fun or satisfaction. So, we listed out every element used in existing PvP content and carefully selected the ones that could be reimagined. Through this process, we were able to create a mode with entirely new rules that offers a fresh experience rooted in TL’s core PvP gameplay.Victory Beyond Combat AloneWe want to strike the right balance between gameplay elements so that victory isn’t decided by combat alone and even those with unique playstyles can enjoy Battlegrounds. While some players enjoy fighting directly, others may not feel confident in combat, but if they have other ways to contribute meaningfully to the team, we believe they’ll find PvP content more engaging.In many PvP experiences, once players feel that the match is lost, they tend to give up or leave early. That’s why we plan to include more comeback opportunities in all future game modes, so players feel motivated to keep pushing until the end and experience the thrill of turning the tide. Even if a team falls apart, we’re working to ensure that those who give it their all can still be properly rewarded.Of course, given the nature of PvP, it won’t always be easy. However with every new mode we introduce, we plan to ensure that factors beyond just fighting will play a meaningful role in determining the outcome. We hope you'll continue to follow the evolution of Battlegrounds as it grows.A Collaboration with PlayersWe consider Battlegrounds a collaboration with all of the players who’ve enjoyed TL’s existing PvP modes because your gameplay has been a constant source of inspiration for us. We’d like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you.We hope you enjoy a blend of familiarity and freshness in Battlegrounds and would greatly appreciate your feedback. New game modes will continue to be added to Battlegrounds over time. As the mode evolves, expect challenges with new and more complex rules beyond what the initial release offers. We look forward to hearing your thoughts along the way.Stonegard Siege Map ReworkNCSOFT shared additional insight into the goals and inspiration behind the Castle Siege map rework.New Goals for an Old MapWe’ve been closely monitoring player behavior, feedback, and approaches every weekend during siege events, gaining valuable insights along the way. In the current Stonegard Siege, many areas of the terrain naturally lead to prolonged standoffs, which can make gameplay feel dull. We aimed to improve these terrain features as much as possible to keep the action flowing.Next, we wanted to encourage strategic variety. By now, most players are familiar with each other’s strategies. Fighting under the same conditions for extended periods of time reduces the overall enjoyment.While TL’s combat has evolved rapidly, Stonegard Castle hasn’t kept up with those changes. We felt it was necessary to revise the structure and strategic points to deliver a fresh experience. Ultimately, our goal is to increase the frequency of throne takeover attempts and make sieges far more dynamic and engaging.Challenges Between Both Sides of StonegardIn the early phases of siege monitoring, combat dynamics shifted so rapidly that it was difficult to confidently say, “This is the right direction.” However, as more data accumulated, a clear vision began to emerge. From that point on, we were able to move forward with a focused plan.We started with the belief that siege battles needed to become more offense-driven, but we also had to ensure that defending teams who fought hard to claim the castle wouldn’t feel unfairly punished. Striking the right balance between active offense and rewarding defense was one of the toughest parts of the process.Reworked PlaystylesWith the ...",1757438363,
2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY Update 2.26.0,"THRONE AND LIBERTY Update 2.26.0 downtime will begin at 10:30 p.m. PT (5:30 a.m. UTC) on September 3 and last approximately 6 hours. Find the full list of changes below. GUILD ALLIANCE SIZE REDUCEDThe maximum number of guilds that can be joined in an Alliance is now 2 instead of 4.We will be monitoring the ongoing impact of this change and feedback from the community as we understand there are a range of opinions on Alliance limits, and will consider additional modifications if necessary.To support this change, existing Alliances will be disbanded to allow guild leaders to re-form alliances with the second guild of their choice.AVAILABLE NAME REFRESH - Deleted Characters and GuildsNames previously used by characters or guilds that have been deleted will be available again for use after this maintenance.SERVER TRANSFER COOLDOWN RESETThe 30-day cooldown period after performing a Server Transfer has been reset in preparation for upcoming content releases.OREMONG HIDE AND SEEKComing soon: Mischievous citrus have been spotted popping up in Laslan, Stonegard, and Talandre regions.Roll out and find the hiding Oremong to ponder their prize list!Rumor has it, these friendly citrus are selling Rainbewe morphs, titles, portrait frames, fishing rods, and more.GENERALArena: Season 3 is now scheduled to end on September 17 with the start of maintenance.Console: Fixed an issue causing players to get automatically kicked shortly after joining a Party or Vanguard.Wand: Players who are tethered with Ray of Disaster now properly take damage when moving.Wand: The Ray of Disaster's ""Concentration Effect Time"" specialization now properly grants a damage boost.Wand: Ray of Disaster now properly deals damage to a 2nd target after the 1st target dies.Wand: Fixed an issue causing Vampiric Contract to occasionally stop providing its benefits.Greatsword: Blood Devotion's ""Damage Transfer Increase"" specialization no longer displays 2 different values for how much it increases transferred damage.Spear: Updated the description of the Mortal Wrath skill from ""...the attack always becomes a Heavy Attack"" to ""...the attack always triggers from a Heavy Attack"", matching it's functionality.Localization: Fixed an issue causing Korean text to display in the Heroic Accessory Trait Info page.Cosmetics: Fixed an issue with the Azure Moon Weapon skins causing the 3rd dye slot to not update the expected areas.",1756918924,
2429640,Hyperboost Feature Set Deep Dive,"We see the Hyperboost Feature Set as a critical turning point. It is an easier and less intimidating entry point for new players, a refreshed experience for existing ones, and a strategic initiative to grow and solidify the community as a whole.With key system changes, major content updates, and balance adjustments happening now, we felt the Solisium’s Awakening Update on September 18 was the perfect opportunity to encourage new and returning players to jump in. Catch up with NCSOFT for everything you need to know before these server changes go live next month.More than just a fast-track leveling environmentThe Hyperboost Feature Set includes a variety of tangible bonuses that players can immediately feel across all servers. The core bonus is the increased acquisition rate of key progression resources such as gear enhancement materials. Compared to previous progression, players can obtain these resources at a much faster rate, allowing them to rapidly boost their combat power in a shorter period of time.Additionally, new Growth Support Missions will give special rewards. These rewards are tied to reaching specific level milestones, clearing content, and enhancing equipment, which enables players to progress through regular combat as well as goal-oriented tasks.Accelerate growth, while preserving the essence of the TL experienceOur core philosophy for the Hyperboost Feature Set is: “Accelerate growth, while preserving the essence of the TL experience.”TL isn’t just a game about leveling up your character. For many, the endgame is just as fun as the main story quest. However, getting to that point has traditionally taken a significant amount of time. The Hyperboost Feature Set is both an experiment and a structural solution to this issue. While we’ve deliberately accelerated the growth curve, it’s not just about inflating numbers. We’ve designed the experience so players can reach key content faster and engage with it in a richer, more meaningful way.In short, our goals are a faster start, the preservation of core gameplay experiences, and a sustainable structure for long-term player engagement. We aim to reduce the burden of early progression, without compromising depth or quality.A Significant Advantage to PlayersOn existing servers, long-time players have already secured positions in high-end content. In contrast, new players can start on our newly added servers where everyone starts fresh in a reset environment. This removes the disadvantages tied to joining late, allowing all players to compete and cooperate on equal footing. As a result, new players can participate without feeling overwhelmed, and returning players have the chance to re-enter the game strategically in a refreshed setting.It’s Not Too Late to Start NowThere’s one clear message we want to deliver through this feature set: “It’s not too late to start now.”These new features are specifically designed to help lower the barrier of entry for new and returning players without taking away the progress or accomplishments of current players. In other words, this is part of a broader strategy to support sustainable player growth within the TL ecosystem. We hope this opportunity allows many players to quickly access TL’s core content and rediscover the thrill of battle, cooperation, and competition. For those looking for a fresh challenge, the Hyperboost Feature Set will be the perfect starting point.Thanks for your support! We’ll see you in Solisium when the Hyperboost Feature Set releases alongside the Orb, Housing, Dimensional Trials revamp, and Battlegrounds as part of Solisium’s Awakening on September 18.",1756843244,

2429640,Behind the Scenes: Housing,"Housing is about calling a small slice of Solisium your own. Once you purchase a house, you can display your crafted furniture, showcase your style, and hang out with friends. There’s even progression for Housing, letting you go from basement dweller to Kastleton or Vienta Village elite. Take a behind the scenes Housing tour with NCSOFT before this new feature releases on September 18.Q: What was the inspiration for Housing?A: Since most of our content has traditionally been combat-focused, there was both internal and external demand for non-combat content. We wanted to offer players a space where they could express their individuality, set their own goals, and become immersed in a different kind of gameplay. If we could blend that with Solisium’s rich lore and beautifully detailed graphics, then all the better.Housing is more than just decoration. It’s a feature that allows players to showcase their creativity and personal taste. There’s no single “correct” way to do it. That sense of limitless possibility was what made us especially excited to develop it.These images were captured using NPC housing as an example. Actual player housing may differ in certain details.With the addition of features like gathering level progression, handcrafting, and customizable homes, we hope players can clearly feel our intentions behind the Housing content.Q: What was your goal when designing Housing?A: We had three main goals when designing the Housing system.First, we wanted Housing to feel naturally integrated into the overall game world. To achieve this, we designed village houses to be more than just background elements. They are now meaningful, interactive spaces for players.Second, we focused on accessibility and usability. We wanted players to be exposed to Housing in a natural way and feel intrigued enough to give it a try.Lastly, we aimed to foster player-to-player communication through Housing. Players can invite others to visit their featured homes. These social features will continue to evolve based on community feedback.In terms of usability, our goal was to make furniture placement simple and intuitive while still offering enough freedom for players to express their creativity. To support this, we implemented features like snap alignment for easier placement, as well as the ability to finely adjust furniture using pitch, roll, and yaw. Players can even elevate and overlap items to create more detailed layouts.Q: How did you decide on the visuals?A: We wanted the towns – places players have always passed through – to feel like more than just background scenery. Our goal was to make them spaces players would actually want to stay in. With that in mind, we designed the houses to reflect the unique charm of each village.For example, in Kastleton we incorporated elements like plazas, markets, harbors, the sea, and city views to capture the lively atmosphere of the town. In contrast, Vienta was inspired by highland terrain. We designed the interiors with many stairs and gave the impression that the houses are perched somewhere along a cliffside, making players feel as if they truly live within that region.Q: What was the greatest challenge in designing this feature?A: The biggest challenge was aligning the team’s ambitions and dreams for what Housing should be. There were so many things we wanted to include, and even during the prototyping phase, the direction shifted multiple times. Housing needs to be a living, evolving feature, a space where memories are built over time and creativity turns into personal expression.We’re constantly weighing two key values: freedom and longevity. We ask ourselves how much freedom is enough to fully capture a player’s individuality? How can we keep adding new layers of enjoyment to make Housing something players continue to come back to?Q: How did Housing change from original concept throughout development?A: What should a Housing space actually look like?This was the question we wrestled with the most and it went through many changes throughout development. After much discussion, we ultimately decided on something familiar yet refreshing: the villages of the Solisium continent, now reimagined through the lens of Housing.Our vision doesn’t end with villages. We dream of a future where players can build a home on a hill once scarred by battle, or in the heart of a quiet forest and look out the window at a world that feels truly theirs. Bringing that exciting future to life is our next goal.Q: Why should players that typically don’t use Housing features in video games give this one a try?A: Housing in THRONE AND LIBERTY was designed to be accessible and easy to enjoy through the Extra Codex system. Even players who haven’t traditionally been interested in Housing content will find it simple to create their own personal space and from there, begin crafting new stories of their own.From the revamped gathering experience to decorating your home, we believe this will offer a fresh and e...",1756232039,

2429640,Behind the Scenes: Orb,"Go behind the scenes with NCSOFT on the Orb, a new magic-based support/DPS weapon coming in the next major update. Orbs can be placed and remotely triggered depending on your situation. How will you take control of combat through this new playstyle?Q: How did your team decide on the size of the Orb?A: We spent a lot of time adjusting the size back and forth with each test, trying to find that perfect balance where the Orbs felt visually present, but didn’t interfere with the player's field of view. In the end, we arrived at a size that gives the Orbs a strong presence in combat without disrupting the overall flow of gameplay.Q: How did you determine its abilities and mechanics?A: The goal of the Orb goes beyond raw damage output. The Orb’s abilities and mechanics were built around the core concept of a weapon that lets players shape the battlefield and shift the flow of combat. Unlike traditional weapons that focus on direct damage or instant healing, the Orb was designed to function as a tactical tool.With up to three Spheres, the Orb’s unique resource, players can protect allies, block enemy advances, and create openings for advantageous engagements. The effectiveness of each skill would then vary depending on the placement and number of these Spheres on the field. Through extensive playtesting, we refined the system into one that is easy to learn yet offers game-changing potential in the hands of skilled players. Another goal was to introduce a new playstyle that rewards not only quick reflexes and precise aim, but also strategic planning and strong team coordination.Q: What was the visual inspiration for the Orb?A: The name Orb was chosen because it perfectly captures both the physical form of a sphere and the cosmic energy concentrated within it. The visual concept was inspired by celestial gravity, orbital movement, and fantasy concepts where magical constructs have the power to distort space itself. We wanted it to feel like a conduit through which players could harness the power of the universe — both functionally and visually evoking themes of astronomy, galaxies, and warped space. With that in mind, we aimed to visually express that the Orb is not just a physical object, but a force that dominates the battlefield by shaping space itself.Q: What was your greatest challenge in designing this weapon?A: The biggest challenge in designing the Orb was creating a combat flow that balances offense, defense, and area control within a single weapon. A key question was how to make Spheres feel both intuitive to use and rich in strategic depth. We also aimed to build a skill shot-based playstyle that’s easy for newcomers to pick up, yet offers endless tactical possibilities for advanced players.To overcome these challenges, we went through countless prototypes and playtests. As a result, the Orb has become a weapon that’s easy to start with but deeply rewarding to master.Q: How did the Orb change from its original concept throughout development?A: From the early stages of development, the Orb was built around a clear concept: area control and protection using summoned Spheres. We stayed true to this core idea throughout development, focusing on refining the details, from numerical tuning and skill synergy to visual effects, to elevate its overall polish.As a result, the final version isn’t drastically different from the original concept. This reflects how clearly defined the weapon’s direction was from the start, and how carefully we worked to preserve and perfect that vision.Thanks for your support! We can’t wait for players to experience the Orb firsthand when it releases alongside Housing, the Hyperboost Server, the Dimensional Trials revamp, and Battlegrounds as part of the next major update.",1755625197,

Throughout their journey, they meet various characters and solve incidents, becoming a central figure in that organization. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/1OnPHukfUVc253PqCNz2ly/e41401f0e71c2e99a542c131201e527d/Calanthia_Raid_-_Calanthia_Concept_Art_-_1920.jpg Naturally, they also learn about key members, such as DaVinci and Janice Cartair, as well as important figures in Arkeum, like Reville Lupius, Calanthia, and Kazar. As part of the Adventure Codex and Bonus Codex updates releasing alongside the Raid, you will discover more not only about Calanthia but also about the stories of major Resistance figures, including Clay and Roen. Experience the stories surrounding the Altar of Calanthia to find out whether you’ll encounter her more in the future. Raid Difficulty Find out what kind of experiences players can look forward to when challenging more difficult modes. How will the difficulty of future raids be expanded? NCSOFT: We are designing the difficulty to require both 'harmony' and 'growth'. It's not just about placing stronger enemies, but requiring organic party composition and individual role performance abilities. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/4ebpbI2Rv2CJPkvCZxvY3Y/c4722b3ebde61fcb8653cad58627db40/Altar_of_Calanthia_-_Exterior_Entrance_Concept_Art_1920.jpg Additionally, progressing to higher difficulty levels will require learnings gained from lower-level raid experiences. Each raid is designed to provide players with meaningful triumphant moments. Given that THRONE AND LIBERTY has many skilled PvE players, we have high expectations for their abilities. The hard difficulty mode of the Calanthia Raid is extremely challenging. Even top players will barely be able to clear it. However, as players regularly play it and acquire unique gear, the difficulty will gradually become more manageable. For the future expert difficulty mode, players can expect an even more intense challenge. We can't wait to see players try it.

2429640,Wilds of Talandre: World Design,"https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/4qR7G95NqmB6uYyF2E39tN/1e2ae110bf1ea76d017abda3f9e94214/01_Talandre__Illustration_1920x720.jpg?fm=webp THRONE AND LIBERTY: Wilds of Talandre introduces new diverse environments to Solisium. From an ancient library hidden within the cliffs of a lake to the ruins of a fallen ancient giant, NCSoft iterated on multiple concepts before doubling the size of their world. We caught up with the Development Team for insights into how they meticulously crafted some of the free expansion’s most memorable areas. Herba Village https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/5W3AHNyzo6LzjxWzFV1cfz/2f547fd4a1b57fece9a475f0879117d8/Herba_Village_concept_art_1920_1080.jpg Herba Village’s wind wheel lift is located at the highest point in the center of Talandre, allowing players to easily take in the landscape of the new zone. The wind car routes were also designed with this in mind. We spent a lot of time thinking about what a flying chariot in THRONE AND LIBERTY would look like. Using magical elements only felt too artificial and predictable, so we started with the concept of a modern-day cable car and explored ways to make it feel as medieval as possible. An aerial transportation system using massive chains or ropes. Operated manually or powered by wind, using cogs and pulleys. A large rotating wheel that winds and unwinds the rope to create movement, similar to a quarry pulley system. It’s not just a simple means of transportation, but an open-air design that allows players to fully appreciate the breathtaking vistas of Talandre. Bercant Mansion https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/3xonQuaIY8s6GQhDpN7Kzk/4711a94f7dc36f9f075223c402d48921/06_Talandre_Bercant_Mansion_Illustration_1920.jpg We referenced the layouts of various castles and mansions to make Bercant Mansion feel like an actual home of a powerful noble faction. As a result, the Bercant Masion features a unique architectural style not seen in existing zones, designed with the goal of leaving a strong impact on players. Inspired by the ornate exterior of the Louvre, we prioritized stylistic distinction over historical accuracy. The mansion tells the tragic story of Limuny Bercant. We reinforced this narrative visually by contrasting its elegant architecture with the dilapidated village and desolate farmland outside. Inside, we used red as a key accent color to create a sense of opulence, standing in stark contrast to the desaturated tones of the exterior. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/3w8CliH6kHJjnWfyxXHMck/a528450cdfd8eef9958d10f63ada5f34/Bercant_Mansion_02_1920.jpg In the audience chamber, where Limuny appears as the boss, the most beautiful red tree in the realm ironically emphasizes the theme of a cursed transformation into nature. We aimed to create a dramatic contrast between the mansion’s interior and exterior for a truly memorable scene. This area serves as a key visual representation of the game’s story and themes, designed to leave a lasting impression and enhance player immersion. Temple of Truth https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/12k3OdtzzYvzdlsEeAlDfH/d84ffd17e35a199ecdd0382dd7d06b64/Temple_of_Truth_02_1920.jpg The Temple of Truth was inspired by an ancient library hidden within the cliffs of a lake. To emphasize the mystery of antiquity and the passage of time, it features a concealed entrance and ancient architecture. We made the ancient and mysterious characters luminescent to express the mystical power of the library, while the crumbling and ruined appearance further emphasizes the passage of time. As for the theme of recording facts and history, what better choice than a library? https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/7ct3suPqiuG3Xei3zzcQzm/3f06c4acd62627641f7c9eb5e3cf9a35/Temple_of_Truth_03_1920.jpg This is a place where ancient records transform into truth, surrounded by enormous inscriptions. Here players will confront knowledge long thought lost to time. Quietis’ Demesne This region originates from Quietis, a giant who ruled over water. We wanted to convey the events that took place here in the past. Said to be the most powerful of the ancient giants, Quietis lost his heart in a war against a coalition of humans, elves, and orcs. He was then petrified and became Conquest of Quietis, a land that still bears the scars of battle. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/4u2TVTnW9euVrSW4YhGNss/dfee1bd4635d8a7ec197dee4f92feb93/Quietis_s_Demesne_03_1920.jpg The concept for this area is a landscape of ruins intertwined with the undulating terrain formed when Quietis lost his heart and collapsed. The Guardian’s Forest: This area represents the aftermath of Quietis’ fall, where the ground has cracked open, releasing powerful magical energy. We envisioned this mystical forest as a place where destruction and magic intertwine creating an awe-inspiring yet eerie atmosphere. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/RxuonAxP5DSN4wNKseGK1/74a7eff162fefde6172fdefbdc8e5a5c/Quietis_s_Demesne_01_192...",1746553377,

Illusions are character-bound (not account) and will now appear in the Mirror Boutique. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/3asC1m77DJuKpuqcoMBT0x/ed236730ddcecf38ef4654eb890c0fe5/TL_Header_Blog_Images_2025_LifeStyle_D_1080_CT-000015060.jpeg Illusion Scrolls Illusion Scrolls can be obtained through the in-game shop in exchange for Lucent. Please note that Illusion Scrolls are character-bound and cannot be sold in the Auction House. 1x Illusion Scroll: 100 Lucent 30x Illusion Scroll Bundle: 2400 Lucent (20% discount) Can I create Illusions across different Weight, Weapon, and Apparel Types? You can use Illusions across light to heavy or medium armor appearances and vice versa. You can only use Illusions within the same Weapon type (Swords to Swords, Staffs to Staffs, etc). Illusions only work across the same slot for apparel (head only works with head, chest with chest, etc). All tiers, but only epic grade items can become Illusions. How do Dyes Work with Illusions? Once a player uses the Illusion Scroll to collect an appearance, they can then use dye to change the color of their Illusion just like with current outfits from the Shop. The color can be kept or reverted to default color through the mirror boutique. Thanks for your support! We look forward to seeing what eye-catching Illusions the community will create.",1745427237,

It includes a new system to manage your runes, adjustments to Guild and Riftstone Boss loot, and more. Find the full list of changes listed below. RUNE MANAGEMENT A new Rune Book UI has been added to the Item section of the Main Menu. Instead of obtaining multiple copies of each rune as an item, obtaining runes now unlocks and levels up a single unified entry in the Rune Book UI - these unified basic Rune can be equipped to multiple items at once. Chaos Runes can only be equipped to one item at a time. Rune Synergies have been simplified by removing the various quality tiers and providing a single maximized Synergy benefit for each rune color combination. The Rune listings allow you to search, favorite, and filter through the list of your available Runes. When selecting an item to modify equipped runes, the rune list will only show runes that are eligible to equip to that item type. Drag and drop Runes from your collection list to the Item's unlocked Rune slots in the top section of the UI to equip Runes to an item. The rune list now displays the level, stat benefit, and stat value of each collected rune along with a progress bar that displays along the bottom of each Rune entry. This progress bar acts as a Rune leveling progress guarantee; now when you receive Runes of the same level as the one you have collected, this progress bar increases until it fills. Once filled, that rune will increase to the next level; setting a maximum amount of times, you can receive an individual rune of the same level before receiving a rune level increase. Chaos Runes: A maximum of 100 Chaos Runes can be stored in the Rune UI. Chaos Runes you don't intend to use can be deleted from the list, freeing up a slot. Rune Fragments will no longer be able to be acquired, and any existing rune fragments in your inventories or storage will eventually be removed! GUILD RAID AND RIFTSTONE BOSSES Adjusted the loot drop tables for Talandre Guild Raid and Riftstone bosses (Daigon, Leviathan, Pakilo Naru, Manticus Brothers) to include a guaranteed T2 Armor or Accessory drop on each kill in addition to the current drop pools. MATERIAL TRANSMUTATION Material Transmutation: Implemented options to auto-add designated material types and grades to your Material Transmutation progress. Material Transmutation: Added the ability to split stacks of items with Shift-Left Click when adding items to Material Transmutation. Material Transmutation: Bulk-adding materials now selects up to 300 eligible items, increased from the previous cap of 20 at a time. GENERAL Dimensional Trial: Fixed an issue preventing groups from posting Party Board recruitment above Tier 1 for Dimensional Trials. Added the option to copy skill and specialization presets to a new preset for editing as an alternative to creating skill presets from a blank state. Skill presets can now also be pasted as a chat link that allows others to copy the preset skill and specialization contents. Replaced Rare Rune chests with Epic Rune chests for the following reward types: Dimensional Trials, Weekly Missions, Arena Coin shop, Abyss dungeons, World Bosses, Guild Raids, and Material Transmutation. Items: Removed Epic Tier 2 and Tier 1 equipment drops from basic zone population mobs. Adjusted the crafting menu for items like Skill Books to enable you to combine component ingredients that have multiple substitutes into a single craft. Herba Village: Added Arena Sundries Merchant to the available town NPCs. Guilds: Tax Deliver, Siege, and Interserver Riftstone and Boonstone award distribution can now be distributed unevenly when distributing to all members, not just participants. Gate of Infinity, Taedal's Tower: Added the ability to move to other floors without exiting the dungeon. Targeting: Added an option to target nameplate settings to prevent nameplate transparency being applied to targets who are actively attacking you. Siege: Small adjustments to the defense area boundaries to teleport out non-defenders from walls at the start of a Siege. Arena: Fixed a situation where some food buffs that should be removed on Arena entry were not being removed properly. Nebula Island: Removed some ceiling clutter from the boss arena that interfered with viewing angles. Nebula Island: Fixed an issue where Grimturg's attack pattern could behave unexpectedly when its aggro target was at a distance. Guild Raid: Fixed boss reset behavior for Pakilo Naru. Character: Wind indicators on your character are now hidden during cutscenes and interaction camera views. HALL OF ILLUSION Added checkpoints to Hall of Illusion levels to allow players to take breaks between fights. Molgras: Fixed an issue where Molgras could occasionally teleport outside...",1743611007,

However, using this forbidden power sent her into a frenzied state, and she was transformed into a monstrous being. She has been encased in frozen armor and wields a colossal icy spear, and will pose a challenging threat. The first Deluzhnoa Arch Boss battle will take place on March 29. Giant Cordy https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/4EsI7NmRF0nzpZnfbRRd5K/e2d86175ecad95f0cf9c11f12c167f17/Giant_Cordy_1080.jpg A tiny poisonous mushroom spore landed on a fragment of Sylaveth's Star, absorbing ritual energy and mana before transferring its consciousness to another spore. This spore infected a Chief Mitran seed on Mount Snowburn, taking control of its host and absorbing ambient mana to grow tremendously strong. The resulting creature, known as the Giant Cordy, has been linked to numerous disappearances in the Snowburn District. The first Giant Cordy Arch Boss battle will take place on April 2. Dimensional Trials Added the ability to use Party Matchmaking to form Dimensional Trial groups, accessed through the Co-Op Dungeon > Dimensional Trial tab. Dimensional Trials now drop Epic Runes and have received additional loot table updates! Arenas Added new Victory Rewards for Arena matches that award Tier 2 Tokens and potentially other items based on your Arena Ranking. The number of Victory Rewards you can claim is limited and recharges over time, similar to the Dimensional Contract Token system.

Triumphs in either endgame activity will score you unique morphs, titles, and other desirable rewards. Even if you fall short of your goal during one round, failure is sometimes the best lesson for improvement. Another effective way to get better is through these tips from Twitch Creators NorgannonHH and Grenton. Here’s how to get even more enjoyment out of each activity. 3v3 Arena Welcome to the arena, the ultimate proving grounds for battle-hardened warriors. In this cross-server 3v3 mode, players engage in fast-paced, strategic combat. Two unique battlegrounds — the celestial amphitheater and the ever-changing magical laboratory — offer distinct challenges that test adaptability and teamwork. The objective is clear. Be the first team to reach 200 battle points within a tight 5-minute limit. Points are awarded every 30 seconds based on how you perform kills and eliminations, but success requires more than raw power. Scoring incentivizes offense and defense, so it will take a smart use of abilities, quick thinking, and flawless coordination to dominate the arena. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/5o24jpO9qZTjORcsjaHDS7/bcd8280a9aa99beb3bfca9463eee1b35/T_L_WarGames_Screenshots_Arenas_v01_A_1080_CT-000013742.jpeg New Player Tips ""As a new player, you should know that the arenas are dedicated to a rock-paper-scissors combat,“ said NorgannonHH. ""Each class archetype will have its counter. Therefore, in the composition of 3v3 combat gives space for each option."" During arena combat, positioning plays a fundamental part, not standing too close to the respawn area of your enemies is also part of this, using the environment to remove the line of sight of enemy skills as well, or to gain space to kite. The party leader can place pins to give positional indications and place icons on enemies to give more precise focus target calls. Inside the arena, certain foods cannot be eaten, but foods such as life, mana, or utility can be used prior to entering the arena. This will give you a general advantage against players who do not consume anything. Learn from trial and error through combat to predict certain patterns of specific archetypes. For example, anticipate greatsword skills and combos to parry attacks that can determine the game’s outcome. The importance of cooldowns is absolutely vital. Understanding the average cooldown times between combos will help you make better decisions as a tank, healer, or DPS. For instance, waiting to do a collision push when you see a greatsword player connect their stun and prone combo. The healer would provide a buff like Invincible Wall or Blessed Barrier to avoid the full damage combo that could send them to the respawn. Experienced Player Tips https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/3gqwLi8wQPdL38fhA5QoaJ/0eb4d259c08ee4a213b587a3bf3267c3/T_L_WarGames_Screenshots_Arenas_v01_B_1080_CT-000013742.jpeg Ensure your gear is optimized for arena. Players will often feel less effective in fights when their abilities aren’t as impactful against other players. Your ability selection matters, so it’s important to understand that crowd control or defensive skills may be more important than pure damage. Communicate often and be ready to make decisions based on the situation. Your enemy can make mistakes like missing a stun, blocking too early, or drifting too far from their group to receive support. Call those actions out to help increase your chances of winning! Pay attention to the environment. Some arenas have moving walls and pillars that you can use to your advantage. Whether you can cause your enemy to lose their line of sight or push them out to score a kill, avoid unnecessary open area combat. Dimensional Trials Challenge your favorite dungeons at various difficulty options. Depending on your chosen difficulty, dungeons will have higher enemy stats, harder boss mechanics, and additional effects applied. Clear higher levels to contribute toward leaderboards and seasonal rewards. Dimensional Trials can be challenged repeatedly and do not have a cost to enter. To take on a Dimensional Trial, players must have cleared the 3-Star Dungeon of the same name at least once after this content update. Party members must also meet a minimum Combat Power to enter. There's no time limit to complete a level, but additional levels will be accessible based on the time taken to clear one.

Dimensional Trial Season 1 Rewards Additional Dimensional Trial season reward titles will be sent out during this maintenance for characters who were missed in the March 13 maintenance.

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY Update 2.1.0,"THRONE AND LIBERTY Update 2.1.0 downtime will begin at 10:30PM PT (5:30AM UTC) on March 12 and last approximately 7.5 hours. It includes Nebula Island, Artifacts, new solo dungeon bosses, and new 3-Star Dungeons. Find the full list of changes listed below, plus a guide on our new features from GrobsXO. New Activity: Nebula Island “For me, one of the biggest highlights of Talandre is Nebula Island and the Artifact System,” GrobsXO said. ”If you’re into PvP and love tweaking your character’s build, you're going to love these updates.” Nebula Island is a new interserver activity accessible to level 55 players through the Secret Dungeons' Lawless Wilds tab. Players can spend up to 5 hours per week there, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. The island consists of a central village and six distinct regions, including one peaceful zone and four war zones where PvP is always enabled. Players can access various hunting grounds through portals in the central village and collect Lesser and Greater Nebula Stones to exchange for items. The island features hourly events and periodic field boss battles with limited participation capacity. A new exclusive accessory system called Artifacts has also been introduced specifically for Nebula Island content. New System: Artifacts https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/6OBOGZ15oVLqS29n2yS6dl/a24196adb13a370110c9d5ae9dceee7b/Artifact-1920.jpg Redefine your playstyle through unique skills with Artifact item sets. Artifacts can be obtained from Nebula island and Abyss Dungeons in Talandre. The system consists of six parts: four Talistones, a Solarstone, and a Lunarstone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different Artifact sets across three grades (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare), with some stats being randomly determined upon acquisition. Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching pieces from the same set. The Solarstone provides an Active Skill while the Lunarstone grants a Passive Skill when equipped. New Solo Dungeon Bosses Conquer new solo dungeon bosses like Umbrakan and Lionhead for unique rewards on your way to the throne. Umbrakan The ferocity of a beast, the intelligence of a human, and the vitality of a great tree. This grotesque being hid in the forest to eat small animals and insects for nutrients. However, after absorbing the mana from a human wizard, it began hunting humans. Now it casts illusions to slaughter intruders. Lionhead The Arkeum subjected Demian, a child born between a demon and a human, to intense training, including mana infusions from the Abyssal Meteor. Demian achieved remarkable feats on the battlefield. However, upon seeing blood he caused excessive slaughter. His steel lion helmet became a symbol of death and terror. New 3-Star Dungeons Doomrot Grove https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/1yjNHWGyQzzTgUZOgHQ2s2/37b39849ea0a3c5127cf01f0a30dd114/Screenshot_HighRes_20250124_164530_1920x1080.jpg Norn Bercant was kidnapped by the Crimson family and turned into a ferocious, mutated creature. With a power as immense as her deep grudge, she created Doomrot Grove, a secluded garden cut off from the outside world. Twisted Laboratory https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/7JJqgVZcEE8D9JPcc2FQ6G/e41e419450fe5b122a75d0d827485c89/Screenshot_HighRes_20250124_160322_1920.jpg Bioweapons leaked out of the Crimson family’s lab and killed most people in the manor. The mystery of Kaiser Crimson’s survival remains. Those who discovered the truth have taken it to their grave. Vanguards - Multi-Party (Raid) System We now support raids (multi-party groups) of up to 8 parties and 48 players. Vanguards can be created through the Party Management window. The player who first forms the raid becomes the initial Vanguard Leader, and can transfer the role later. Vanguard Leaders can adjust party composition or remove members from the vanguard. Vanguard Leaders may also set join conditions such as 'Guild Members Only','Allied Guilds Only', or open-entry. Various content can be completed while in Vanguards with some exceptions. You cannot join party-based instances such as Dungeons or Dimensional Trials while in a vanguard. Field Boss instances are also unavailable for entry as a vanguard. If a player enters a Dominion event they will be removed from the vanguard. Entering Siege or Tax Delivery events as a vanguard will remove all members not in the Vanguard Leader's guild from the parties. Nameplate Targeting Enhancements New targeting features have been added to Settings > Gameplay > Character > Large Scale Combat Mode.

Quality of life improvements, updates, and the free Wilds of Talandre expansion continue to help Solisium evolve into an even more enjoyable experience. Many of these changes were a direct result of player feedback. Whether you prefer PvP modes, lifestyle activities, the camaraderie of guilds, or something in-between, there’s something for everyone. Join godspeed and Tico for an overview of the new zone, features, and systems, followed by guides featuring Twitch Creators KanonXO, Grenton, and Wakayashi before you set out on your next quest. What is Wilds of Talandre? KanonXO - Overview “If you're a new player or someone who is thinking about returning to the game to check out the expansion, now would be the best time to do so,“ KanonXO says. ”Tier 2 means there is essentially a reset in gear, so even if you don’t have maxed out Tier 1 gear, that’s okay because everyone needs to farm new Tier 2 pieces and build it up from scratch again anyway. They’re also releasing new T2 blue gear, which is going to be on par with T1 purple, only with less traits that can be attached to them that should also aid in catching up.“ Grenton - Revamped Weapon Mastery “We finally have a way to put our unique play styles and flair into the weapon combination we pick,” Grenton says. “Do you want to be a TRUE tank and give up a lot of offensive capabilities to just be able to tank a ton of damage? Yeah, you can do that! Want to finally fully submerge yourself into the damage over time playstyle of wand and forgo the healing side of it almost completely? Yup, you guessed it you can do that too.” Wakayashi - Returning Players Completed the main story, claimed the throne, or previously felt satisfied with your journey? Wakayashi has you covered. Returning players can look forward to level progression updates, new, diverse events, unexplored field dungeons, and ferocious new field bosses, plus a few surprises. Note: This video is in German, but can be viewed with subtitles.

It includes an extension to the Startree Solstice Pass Point Shop. Find the full list of changes and fixes listed below. Startree Solstice Pass Point Shop Due to an issue that caused the Startree Solstice Pass Point Shop to close earlier than intended, we will be extending the Startree Solstice Pass end date to January 16 to give players who may have missed out on some Point Shop rewards a chance to complete quests and spend any remaining star crystals.

2429640,Tico Talks - Holiday Letter,"Dear THRONE AND LIBERTY Community, What’s up gamers? I’m Tico, the Globalization Design Manager for THRONE AND LIBERTY at Amazon Games. I wanted to do something different from our usual Tico Talks format as the year draws to a close. There's something special about sitting down and writing a letter, especially during the holiday season. So here I am, ready to share some thoughts as we wrap up an incredible 2024. When I reflect back on this year, what stands out aren’t just the countless hours of development or the features we've launched, but also the moments we've shared together. Watching guilds coordinate massive battles, seeing players help newcomers learn the ropes, and reading your passionate discussions about the game — these are the things that make all the hard work worthwhile. Every time I log in and see players enjoying themselves in Solisium, it reminds me why we do what we do. December has been absolutely packed with excitement, and I want to take a moment to celebrate some of these moments with you. On the 5th, we introduced the Spear, and you have astonished me with your creativity! I've seen several unique combinations and strategies that I didn't anticipate, and I have a feeling we're just beginning to see what's possible with this weapon. Along with that, we expanded our fishing content, and it's been nice to have some moments of relaxation in the world to complete my new Codex. We unveiled our challenging Dimensional Trial Dungeons — and wow — the ways you've been tackling these trials has been nothing short of amazing! Watching players push the boundaries of what's possible while mastering these challenges has been incredible. We introduced the new Rune progression system, opening up a whole new method of power progression that's leading to some interesting build combinations, especially with the Spear and new Fortitude stat. One of my personal favorites has been watching guilds utilize the new War Games feature. There's something special about seeing teams practice and perfect their strategies in preparation for those epic open-world battles. And yes, I have to mention it — Equipment and Skill presets are finally here! I know many of you have been waiting patiently for this one, and trust me, I'm just as excited as you are! Finally, the Startree Solstice Event that launched on the 12th has brought such a wonderful festive atmosphere to our world. I've caught myself more than once standing in town watching players show off their holiday cosmetics and enjoying the Winter Amitoi Arena matches. The community's enthusiasm for these seasonal events always brings a smile to my face. https://images.ctfassets.net/z7aj1lm9rbu3/5JrENwQU9P1gjycKv88hzw/fd20f0ca8cbf74516a0825a6513cc54a/TL_Winter-Event_deco_03_1080.jpg I also want to talk about listening to your feedback, beginning with addressing the changes made to Rune distribution on the 19th. Many of you shared concerns about feeling pressured to farm Dimensional Trials for Runes, and I also experienced this firsthand while playing. We've now increased Rune outputs across various content types because we believe you should be able to progress while playing the content you love most. We’ll keep evaluating how it feels after these changes, and we’re not afraid to keep tweaking until it feels right. And to my fellow PvP enthusiasts — don't worry, we haven't forgotten about you. We're working on expanding Rune acquisition through PvP beyond just arena coins, so keep an eye out for those changes in the new year. Looking ahead to 2025, we're tackling some important challenges head-on. First and foremost, we hear your feedback about daily activities feeling a bit overwhelming. While we believe it's important to have engaging content for you to log in and enjoy each day, we recognize that with new additions we've reached a point where the ""daily checklist"" feels more like a chore than an adventure. Finding the right balance here is a top priority for us, and we're exploring several solutions to help you feel less pressured while still maintaining meaningful progression. Another major focus (which I touched on briefly in my last Tico Talks) is continuing our work to improve combat, movement, and targeting systems. Please bear with us, these are important systems that are complicated to iterate on. We're working diligently and can't wait to share more information once we feel we've made significant improvements in the new year. Our goal is to make improvements that ensure your character's interaction with the world feels intuitive and fluid. Whether you're weaving through a complex combat rotation, navigating treacherous terrain, or targeting a specific enemy in the heat of battle, we want it to feel natural. I can't help but feel incredibly grateful as I write this letter. This game has become so much more than just a game — it's a living, breathing world that we've built together through your feedback, passion, and support. Every suggestion you share, ev...",1734723836,

Update 1.11.2 includes a variety of fixes along with adjustments to the Rune system. Find the full list of changes and fixes listed below. General Abyss Points: Increased cap to 40,000 from 20,000. Saurodoma Island: Changed the specific Dimensional Token drops to Dimensional Token Selection Chests instead. A Dungeon Matchmaking penalty was being improperly applied to characters who re-entered a completed dungeon using the Party Matchmaking system, then left the completed instance. This unintended penalty has been removed. Guild Raids: Corrected the weekly reset timer for Guild Raids; these once again reset after weekly maintenance. Guild Raids: Martial Medal Chests were incorrectly listed as a potential reward from Guild Raids and have been removed from the reward display. Arena: After reviewing your feedback, we've reversed the recent Arena map change introduced in 1.10.0 and returned the Arena map rotation to the previous layouts while the removed Arena map receives some additional love and iteration. Morph: The Peryton Ferthur morph went missing from the Morph menu in 1.11 and has been returned. Console: Fixed an issue preventing the Settings menu from closing properly after cycling between tabs. Rune System After reviewing the state of Rune drops starting with the 1.10 update, as well as your feedback, we've broadened the range of content for acquiring Runes and increased Rune drop rates from several sources. The goal is to allow for more variety of activities to contribute to meaningful Rune progression. Increased the amount of Runes rewarded from Dynamic Events and Field Bosses. Runes now drop from Abyssal Dungeons and Guild Raids. Chaos Runes now properly drop from Tier 5+ in Dimensional Trials. Fixed an issue causing the Dissolve results window to be empty when dissolving Runes. Startree Solstice Event Fixed an issue causing the Festival Tree in Stonegard Castle to not accept decorations after the last Siege event. Fixed some placeholder text for Snowdrift Island arena matchmaking UI and Festival Tree map icons. Fixed an issue causing some damage reduction effects to carry over into Snowdrift Island. Xbox: Fixed dark ground textures in the Snowdrift Arena. Xbox: Fixed an issue preventing the Winter Wonderland Headpiece from the Winter Wonderland Bundle from appearing after purchase.

Holiday cheer spreads across Solisium as the Startree Solstice event begins. How will your guild celebrate the most wonderful time of the year? Check out the full release notes, including event details, new Cooking adjustments, additional Arch Boss spawn scheduling, and more, below. Startree Solstice Event The Startree Solstice event will spread holiday cheer across Solisium from December 12 through January 9, 2025. Join event-only Snowdrift Island arena matches for event-specific rewards, explore festive villages with holiday decorations (including Trees of Gratitude), gather themed cosmetics like the Jolly Arsenal weapons via the Event Pass, and more. Even Gigantrite and your Amitoi will participate. Check out our official announcement for full details, including the rewards and activities you can experience in the Startree Solstice. Arch Bosses - Additional Spawns for Bellandir and Tevent Thank you for your patience while we worked to resolve the recent issues related to Arch Boss encounters. We understand the frustration this caused to many, and to ensure players are able to attempt those encounters again, we will be running a limited duration event from December 12, 2024 through January 9, 2025. During this event, Arch Bosses will spawn twice on their normally scheduled days, once in peace and once in conflict. The additional spawn will take place at 6:00 p.m./18:00 server time and the current 8:00 p.m./20:00 time will also spawn as normal. Good luck, adventurers! Lifestyle Content - Cooking New Cooking contracts can be obtained through Contract Managers. The number of unique cooked food items has been reduced by the consolidation of food quality levels. General dishes are now crafted as Uncommon grade, Banquet and dungeon ingredient food as Rare grade, and elixirs come in Rare or Uncommon grade depending on the materials used. The quality of materials used when cooking now determines the quantity of meals received. Rare materials consume 1 ingredient and produce 3 completed meals. Uncommon materials consume 3 ingredients and produce 2 completed meals. Common materials consume 5 ingredients and produce 1 completed meal. Ingredients for Banquets have been adjusted to account for the new grade consolidation and numbers of meals produced through Cooking. Ingredient gathering and drop rates have been adjusted due to the change in quantities consumed and number of meals produced through Cooking. Previously obtained high-tier ingredients intended for use in Banquets can be exchanged for updated rare ingredients through the Dissolve system. All recipes may now be crafted at both Cooking Ovens and Campfires. Dungeon Matchmaking Penalty A cooldown time is now applied for characters who cancel dungeon matchmaking after a party is matched or after entering a dungeon through matchmaking. This cooldown prevents you from queueing for another dungeon immediately. The timer starts at 10 minutes and will increase with subsequent additional cancellations. Re-entering an already completed dungeon using Party Matchmaking while the previous instance is still available results in a matchmaking penalty being applied upon leaving the instance. If re-entering the same dungeon using Party Matchmaking, make sure the previous instance has been cleared before doing so. General Field and Arch Bosses: Increased the drop rates of Rare and Epic gear from these encounters. PvP: Reduced the duration of respawn protection granted after entering Conflict areas via resurrecting at a Guild Resurrection Stone or arriving through a Guild Summoning Circle. Automatic logout time for AFK characters has been increased to 3 hours. Arena: Weekly reset for the Arena has been adjusted to match the weekly maintenance time, similar to other weekly reset content. Arena: Upgraded Purification Stones are now usable while in Arenas. Arena: Added runes to the Arena Vendor that can be purchased with Arena Coins. Weekly Missions: Adjusted the amount of Dimensional Trials needed to complete the weekly mission. Gigantrite: Adjusted the route Gigantrite takes between Stonegard and Saurodoma Island. Fishing: New Fishing Hotspots may appear in bodies of water around the world, indicated by a circling fish effect. The wise fisher knows to cast their line into these areas whenever they’re spotted! Fishing: Expanded the Fishing Codex to include new fish and a new reward tier. War Games: Added team chat channel for use during matches. War Games: Player icons will now display on the minimap.
