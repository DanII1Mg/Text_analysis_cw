However, a genuinely great crossover, where the tone and aesthetics match up to great effect, always fills me with joy. The <strong>Helldivers 2</strong> Killzone crossover last year was meant to be just that - weapons and armor sets that celebrate Guerrilla Game's shooter series while fitting into the galactic battles of Arrowhead's excellent co-op game. However, the limited-time Killzone set ended up being shrouded in controversy before disappearing into the ether.

553850,HELLDIVERS 2 file-size on Steam gets massively reduced,"One problem with a lot of modern games is just how big they're getting, but HELLDIVERS 2 is about to massively shrink thanks to work behind the scenes.

553850,HELLDIVERS 2 Tech Blog #2,"IntroductionHey Helldivers,This blog post is a follow up to my previous post about the installation size of the game on PC which you can find here. Today, I will update you on our progress in reducing the installation size and how you can help.  PC Installation SizeUpdateWe have followed through on our plans and made small reductions in the PC installation size over the last few patches while still adding new content. While this was a good start, our short term fixes have not been enough to keep up with all of the new content in the latest patch. The longer term goal has always been to bring the PC installation size much closer in line with the console versions. We are happy to report that, thanks to our partners at Nixxes, we have reached that goal much sooner than expected. By completely de-duplicating our data, we were able to reduce the PC installation size from ~154GB to ~23GB, for a total saving of ~131GB (~85%). We have completed several rounds of internal QA and are ready to roll this out to early adopters as a public technical beta. Our testing shows that for the small percentage of players still using mechanical hard disk drives, mission loading times have only increased by a few seconds in the worst cases. This is live NOW!Only a few seconds difference?Further good news: the change in the file size will result in minimal changes to load times - seconds at most. “Wait a minute,” I hear you ask - “didn’t you just tell us all that you duplicate data because the loading times on HDDs could be 10 times worse?”. I am pleased to say that our worst case projections did not come to pass. These loading time projections were based on industry data - comparing the loading times between SSD and HDD users where data duplication was and was not used. In the worst cases, a 5x difference was reported between instances that used duplication and those that did not. We were being very conservative and doubled that projection again to account for unknown unknowns.Now things are different. We have real measurements specific to our game instead of industry data. We now know that the true number of players actively playing HD2 on a mechanical HDD was around 11% during the last week (seems our estimates were not so bad after all). We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in HELLDIVERS 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs. Great! When does this happen? How can I help?Do you want to be an early adopter? You can opt-in right now and help us test the slim version! There are no functional differences between the legacy and slim versions besides the installation size. You will be connected to the same galactic war as everyone else and be using the same account you always do - so all progression, war contributions and purchases will carry over between the different versions. You will still be able to matchmake and play with all other players. You can also opt-out at any time if you experience issues. It’s a low-risk way to save ~131GB of space on your drive and help us extend our testing to real-life conditions. Full instructions for opting in and out of the technical beta can be found at the end of this blog post. The future!When the public technical beta confirms that there are no issues present in the slim version, it will become the default version for everyone. For a limited time, we will allow players to opt-in to the legacy version as a way to self-troubleshoot any issues that were not picked up during our internal testing or the public technical beta. Given the very minor differences in loading times between the two versions, there is no justification for us to keep supporting the legacy version long term. Maintaining the legacy version alongside the slim version would only add extra burden to our developers, build machines, QA teams and release processes. Assuming all goes smoothly, the legacy version will be discontinued some time next year. FinallyThank you to the community for all your support with the game as we work through these technical pieces, and thank you to our partners at Nixxes for helping us troubleshoot and implement all the above improvements. Beta InstructionsWarning!Modders beware! Any patch we roll out can break the game if you have mods installed and this one is no exception. We recommend that only players with a clean installation opt-in to the slim version. As always, you mod the game at your own risk.If any of this seems a bit scary to you, we encourage you to just sit back and wait for the slim version to become the default version.Opting in to the slim versionStep 1.In your steam library, right click on HELLDIVERS 2 and select ‘Properties’.Step 2.Next select the ‘Betas’ tab.Step 3.In the Beta Participation drop down list, select “prod_slim”Step...",1764688243,

Weapons & StratagemsLet’s talk firepower first. Python Commandos is loaded with three brand new stratagems and a new primary. The Ministry of Defense received thousands of requests from squad commanders for a minigun and we’re excited to finally give our Helldivers access to the M-1000 Maxigun! Belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, this one is sure to make those bugs bleed.This Warbond also includes another addition to the line-up of faithful sidekicks for your Helldiver: the AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog. This drone is equipped with a flamethrower to coat your foes in the fires of freedom before returning to your backpack to refuel.But if you don’t want to burn the jungle down, consider doing your deforestation with the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool. If the machete doesn’t cut it–whether it’s a tree or an enemy–surely this will!And finally, Python Commandos has a new and unique primary weapon: a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. Heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one! Armors & CapesPython Commandos features two armor sets and, like Viper Commandos before it, they both let you get those guns out for some fresh air.First up is the RS-20 Constrictor light armor set. It’s also the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers, so it’s guaranteed to give your squad bigger and more rippling biceps to intimidate the enemy. But if you’re carrying the team, maybe you need the RS-40 Best of Prey: a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo, and his famously powerful and burly physique.Both of these armors are equipped with the Rock Solid passive, which makes your Helldiver more steadfast against staggering and ragdolling attacks.You’ll also have two capes and coordinating player cards available: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter.Patterns & EmotesAlong with all this, you’ll get access to the Front-Leaning Rest Position emote–now you can drop and give ‘em 20 anytime! Python Commandos also includes the Chameleon Camo pattern for your FRV, Exosuit, Hellpod, and Shuttle.The finishing touch is to get the whole team coordinated with the Python Commando player title and organize a swift strike on anything that stands between you and extraction.The Python Commandos Premium Warbond is dropping in on December 2, divers.

553850,“Diving into the Development Team” part 1,"While our engine team is working on both the engine and another blog related to the tech we use, our Production Director, Alex Bolle, wanted to share some of the processes the development team undergoes at Arrowhead.Question: Alex, can you introduce the production role on Helldivers 2. Can you tell people what that role means to the game that they love?Answer: Absolutely. I see the producer as a chaos manager. We're here to make sure that the creative direction of my fellow directors turns into something concrete, a plan basically.What do we do with the features that they have in mind, with the improvements that we want for the game in a clear timeline with the people we need to make it happen and make sure that this is released on time, and in a state we know we need to be better at.Question: Timing and the cycles in the major updates are something that everybody gets excited about. How do you look at that internally?Answer: Preparing an arc is a recipe that we’re always trying to improve, sometimes it’s too salty, sometimes it needs more salt. We’re constantly trying to improve the live service experience. It usually starts with a very strong fantasy: “what do we want the players to experience?”, then from that we create a list of initiatives for the game, from features, to major orders, the warbonds and so on.In fact what’s interesting here is that for the longest time, our recipe was rather unbalanced, some would say way too spicy (but I’m from Corsica, I love spices). We were focused a lot on content. Listening to the players, we realized as a team that there is more than that. So we’re changing our approach. Some initiatives are all about cleaning our live features, introducing quality of life… We’re in the early stages of this, but so far when I look at future arcs, it’s promising and something I’m eager to let the community taste.Question: So if we look at that, there's some progress that you and the team have been making towards the hardening, tell me more about that.Answer: So, hardening is our last step in the development process before release, and it’s been something that we’ve pledged to take as a main priority moving forward. We are currently addressing the issues and looking for more before we release more goodness for the players. For the longest time our features would be considered ready and implemented in the release build at the very last minute. We’re working with the teams to stop that. We use the term “functional” as a minimum standard for when features should be in the game. For example, the Hive Lord, as functional, was a very rough version of what players experienced.Question: How is the development team structured?Answer: We have big groups of teams that we call Areas, and I love to talk about these as the whole Helldivers’ experience. Picture this: The first Area you experience as a player is Meta. Meta is responsible for the entire Galaxy’s systems, they define the rules of the whole game, and you’ll find your beloved Game Masters in this Area!It’s time to Dive into the enemies lines, here comes GameWorld: they are world builders, a bunch of talented people creating new biomes like the Hive Worlds, and the missions the Helldivers will accomplish in the name of democracy. They have some of the “hottest” stuff cooking in right now, but not before we get things in order!It’s time for combat! And we call the next Area… combat (don’t ask a producer to be too creative)! These teams are behind the mightiest enemies encountered, but you all know that you need some good firepower to stomps bugs, so yes, warbonds are done here! There are two areas remaining, very important ones: The first one is what we call the Tech platform, they are running our game engine, and the tools that the rest of the developers will use. Last but not least, our own Ministry Of Truth: The marketing and communication Area, it’s pretty self explanatory, this is our voice. Actually, I wouldn't write this if they weren’t here!Thank you for diving and we'll see you next time!",1762437790,

553850,HELLDIVERS 2: Tech Blog #1,"Hey, Helldivers. This is the first of what we intend to become a regular series of posts where the engineering team talks about the technical health of the game and some of the technical challenges we’re working through.  Installation Size The installation size of HELLDIVERS 2 on PC seems to be a hot topic right now so let’s start with that. The current install size on PCs is around 150 GB. This is roughly three times larger than the same game installed on consoles! Given the amount of content in the game, the size on consoles seems quite reasonable so the obvious question is - why is it so large on PC?  Data Duplication Much of the data in the PC version of HELLDIVERS 2 is duplicated. The practice of duplicating data to reduce loading times is a game development technique that is primarily used to optimize games for older storage media, particularly mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and optical discs like DVDs.  This practice is largely unnecessary for games deployed on Solid State Drives (SSDs) which is why the console versions of HELLDIVERS 2 do not do this.  The Problem with Mechanical Hard Drives The main issue with a mechanical HDD is seek time. An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data. The time it takes for this arm to ""seek"" or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck.  Imagine a large game level with various objects - trees, rocks, buildings, props. If the data for these objects is scattered all over the hard drive, the read head has to physically jump around the disk, which adds a lot of time to the loading process.  The Solution: Duplication To solve this problem, we deliberately duplicate certain data files (like a common tree texture or a sound effect) and place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.  For example, our build system will ensure that a copy of a tree texture is stored on the same part of the disk as the level geometry data. When the game loads the level, the read head can access all the necessary information in a single, continuous sweep, without having to ""seek"" to a different location. This dramatically speeds up loading times.  The Modern Era: SSDs The need for this technique has largely disappeared with the widespread adoption of SSDs. An SSD stores data on flash memory chips and has no moving parts. This means that ""seek time"" is virtually nonexistent. An SSD can access any piece of data on the drive almost instantly, regardless of where it is physically stored.  Increasingly, modern games are optimized for the sequential read speeds of SSDs and do not need to rely on the older method of duplicating assets. This is one of the key reasons why new games often explicitly require an SSD in their minimum system specifications.  Should HELLDIVERS 2 continue to optimize for mechanical HDDs? This is the six-million-dollar question. On the one hand, they are a part of our minimum spec PC requirements. On the other hand - how many HELLDIVERS 2 players are still using mechanical HDDs? The truth is that we don’t currently know. Even the Steam user surveys are unable to give us data on mechanical HDD use in the overall gamer population. Our best estimates put it at around 12% of all PC gamers but the data is very unreliable and relies on a lot of extrapolations. Until we can more accurately determine the number of mechanical HDDs that HELLDIVERS 2 is installed on, it is difficult to know how many players will be impacted by reducing the amount of data duplication. Even if that number is small, keep in mind that the load time for each player dropping into a mission is determined by the slowest member of the squad.  Solutions While we take steps to gain more clarity on the number of impacted players, we are actively exploring several different solutions in parallel and will begin rolling them out in future updates as soon as they are ready. We cannot eliminate all duplication without making loading times for mechanical HDDs 10 times slower and we do not feel that this is acceptable. There are however some compromises that we can make which will improve the installation size without blowing out the loading times too much.  Short term We’ve made some small gains in the next update by sweeping our systems for unused assets and obvious problems, but you will not likely notice them because the new stuff we’ve added will eat those gains. It’s not a game-changer but at least the install size will stop growing.  Medium term Beyond the next update, we’re exploring taking some of the worst offenders in terms of duplication and de-duplicating them by putting them in “very common assets” bundles which will always be loaded under set conditions (eg- specific faction/biome). This does mean that loading times will get a bit worse for players using mechanical HDDs - it is unfortunate but unavoidable. Our early testing shows we should be ...",1759480219,

553850,State of the Game Update #1,"Greetings Helldivers,We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs. We’ve seen the feedback across Discord, forums, Reddit and our dashboards. You’ve been loud, clear, and absolutely right to expect better. We also recognise that our recent updates haven’t hit the mark, and our silence hasn’t helped. That’s on us. We read all of it and we are hard at work creating a roadmap to address this.Starting with the good news: there is an incoming update (mid October-ish) where we’ll start chipping away at: Some key crash fixesFixed the Primary weapon/Side-arm audio that stops during a missionMinor performance improvementsLong overdue bug fixes, like Charger footstep sounds (pretty useful) or weapon audio stopping mid missionNo more landing on cavesA Balance Pass (we’re unleashing Niklas & Lennart) For some of the bigger performances pieces unfortunately we can’t wave a ‘short-turnaround-magic-wand’, nor would a 60 day patch fix them fully (rather it would be duct tape where we need to solder); so we’re working on a bigger development plan as to how we can address some of the larger concerns. Short term, we think the above will make a noticeable improvement and beyond that we’ll keep working on the top issues you keep raising. In the future, we’re planning more transparency and more talk! We’re looking to share more about the processes, performance and how we got here, plus further improvements and evolution. For starters expect another post next week to kick that off. Between the Xbox launch, the Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond, the free Into the Unjust update, and other surprises, we’ve welcomed a ton of new players, brought back veterans, and delivered a lot of content. Now, it’s time to double down on fixes, polish, and better communication.TL;DRWe hear you, we want things to be in a better state, we are taking it very seriously, we will continue working and sharing.

Prepare your squad to disappear into the fog and discover new dangers, from towering structures built by Terminids to what horrors lurk beneath the planet surfaces. Into the Heart of Darkness {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/69083650548db94fd9cd8b11f832769edfc43b79.jpg Deep underground lies a labyrinth of cave tunnels that twist and turn, infested with the Hive Lung that seems to be the force that produces the thickening fog that makes up the Gloom. Because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support. It’ll be your team alone against the horror.

Once close enough, they erupt from the ground and attack. It doesn’t stop there. The Gloom has mutated the Terminids even further, into grotesque monsters like the Dragonroach: a menace in the sky that dives unsuspecting Helldivers and rains down burning bile. Our reports indicate that there are even greater, more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds, Helldiver. You must find them and take them out.

Helldivers must defend the rig from attacks while it traverses the treacherous Hive World terrain to the next drill site, where it will extract oil. Meanwhile in the underground, you’ll be forced to locate and destroy the Hive Lung in an effort to stem the spread of the Gloom. There are also new optional and sub-objectives available, too. It’s going to take all your determination and teamwork to stop the infestation from spreading any further and liberate the Hive Worlds. Get ready to dive Into the Unjust on September 2, Helldivers! Introducing the Dust Devils Premium Warbond We’re not sending you to a Hive World without the best gear we have to offer, Helldiver. The Ministry of Defense has fast-tracked the deployment of the Dust Devils Warbond, which will ensure survival in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.

553850,Helldivers 2 Control Group Warbond launches July 17!,"Attention, Helldivers! The Ministry of Defense Research & Development team has just declassified the following information for immediate release. You have been cleared to field test a new range of experimental weapons built from acquired alien technology. R&D scientists have completed the Control Group Premium Warbond* for deployment to your Super Destroyer! Weapons & StratagemsFirst up, in the primary weapon category, is the VG-70 Variable, a seven-barrelled volley gun with three different firing modes: Auto, which has three selectable RPM values; Volley, which fires a single shot from each barrel at once; and Total, which fires all remaining ammunition in one go. Researchers noted that using the Total firing mode with a lot of ammunition may result in bodily harm to the user. Also in need of field testing is the new G-31 Arc grenade. The lightweight G-31 bounces while discharging electricity that strikes enemies (and Helldivers) in proximity.The next declassified item is the PLAS-45 Epoch support weapon which charges plasma into a focused sphere which is then fired. This weapon is ready for battlefield use, but additional research data suggests that it can explode if overcharged. No safe mode is available. But we're sure you can handle it, Helldiver. This is what field testing is all about! Next up in offensive technology is the A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry. For this sentry, the ammunition canisters on standard turrets have been replaced with a supersized heatsink, allowing the potential for infinite laser firing. However, R&D would like to remind users that the turret can overheat and explode if the laser is continuously active with no cooldown.Perhaps the most significant and exciting development from the Ministry of Defense is the new LIFT-182 Warp Pack stratagem. R&D has harnessed the power of Dark Fluid to generate a (somewhat) stable wormhole on demand. Once the wormhole is active, wearers can teleport short distances with no cooldown between jumps. In practice, the wearer is pulled into the singularity, dematerialized, and rematerialized again in a new location. The head of R&D noted that the dematerialization process can be somewhat painful, and that users should bear in mind that the wormhole cannot maintain integrity for extended periods–each jump will further destabilize it, and the wearer may experience death should the singularity fully collapse. A small price to pay for ultra-convenient traversal!Armors & MoreAnd don’t forget about proper personal protective equipment! Good field testing involves enforcing safety protocols, which is why we’re outfitting Control Group with two new sets of armor designed to provide adequate battlefield protection. For medium armor, we’ve included the AD-26 Bleeding Edge that will allow for protection and greater ease of movement combined. But for more dangerous experiments, there’s also the AD-49 Apollonian heavy armor that’s meant to assist you with the perils of evaluating all this new equipment. Each armor set looks professionally stylish with the coordinating capes, Conductor of Brilliance and Over Artifice Triumphant, and both armor sets feature a new and exciting passive: Adreno-Defibrillator! After you take lethal damage and the Adreno-Defibrillator detects that the user has collapsed, it activates and revives the user to full health. R&D did indicate that the Adreno-Defibrillator only has enough charge for one use to bring the user to maximum health, and the user will begin losing health continually after activating it. In addition to all this, R&D is including new player cards to match the Conductor of Brilliance and Over Artifice Triumphant capes, and we’re giving you access to a new emote to assist in testing: Protect Eardrums. Covering your ears is the leading method to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. Safety first! And, finally, with great scientific discovery comes much hard work and sacrifice, Helldivers, and that’s why we want to recognize your valiant field testing efforts of the Control Group Warbond with a special title: Exemplary Subject. Wear this to show your squad that you got in on the ground floor of this advanced technology! You’ve been recruited into the Control Group, divers. Report to R&D for field testing on July 17! *Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock.",1752152781,

553850,Use the full Force of Law in the streets on June 12!,"When it comes to Super Earth, you are the law–the final word on freedom and Managed Democracy in our streets. You are the keeper of the peace and the deliverer of justice, but you need to step up your gear before you go out on patrol. That’s why the Ministry of Defense has approved the release of the Force of Law Premium Warbond1 on June 12!First, let’s talk gear. The AR-32 Pacifier, a large capacity assault rifle, is the last word in defense against enemies roaming the colonies. Combine it with the new G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which attaches to the perp and dispenses electrical pulses until they’re incapacitated, and you can handle any size squid assembly.But hold on–you’re still going to need some backup, diver. We can’t think of a better companion than the AX/ARC-3 “Guard Dog” K-9. Loyal to its core, the arc-powered K-9 will get between you and any threat to your authority. Just be wary of the occasional (accidental) friendly bite.We’re also including access to the GL-52 De-Escalator support weapon, a grenade launcher that fires high-powered arc grenades. The negotiations will be short and shocking when you call this one in.This isn’t an undercover job, either, so you need to get some gear that lets citizens, SEAF, and squids alike know you’re on the beat. Nothing inspires a sense of safety and obedience quite like the sight of a Helldiver wearing the BP-20 Correct Officer medium armor, with its protective padding and roomy pouches.But maybe you want to be first on the scene, which means you need something lightweight. In that case, try the BP-32 Jackboot, a light armor packing fewer pouches, but more panache with an official-looking tailored jacket and sturdy pauldrons.Both armors come with the Ballistic Padding passive that grants the wearer higher resistance to chest damage, explosive damage, and all damage from bleeding. These armors also pair well with either the Miranda’s Legacy or the Mother Eagle’s Wings capes, and their matching player cards, in coordinating blue and gold color schemes.Force of Law also includes new patterns! Watch them scatter when your paddy wagon, the FRV, rolls down the street with the True Blue pattern, also available for your Exosuits and Hellpods. Speaking of Hellpods, be sure to equip the new booster–Stun Pods–which hotwires your drops to shock nearby suspects into a stupor.We haven’t forgotten the emotes, either. This Warbond comes with three hand signal emotes for Hold, Silence, and Group Up. Even if the mic is off, you can still organize your unit.And lastly, you’ve got the gun, but now you need the badge. You’ll be able to equip the Extra Judicial title, reserved only for those who protect and serve the citizens of Super Earth.Be on the lookout, Helldivers: Force of Law is coming June 12! This Managed Democracy isn’t gonna enforce itself.Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock.",1749152375,

553850,"Helldivers 2 Steam numbers explode after update, as Arrowhead mounts comeback","For the first few months, <strong>Helldivers 2</strong> could do no wrong. Spectacular, funny, and unlike any of its other multiplayer rivals, Arrowhead's shooter only started to wobble around May 2024, when it was first announced that players would have to link their accounts to the Playstation Network. While that stipulation was eventually dropped, the initial damage to Helldivers 2's reputation was already done. Successive balancing updates, which overengineered and flattened out some of the game's most-loved weapons, caused further dismay - from 458,000 concurrent players at launch, just five months later, Helldivers 2 was down to an all-time low of 47,000. But now, thanks to the new Heart of Democracy update, things suddenly look extremely bright. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/helldivers-2/player-count-steam"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/helldivers-2/new-update-heart-of-democracy"">New Helldivers 2 update finally delivers the gigantic battle teased since launch</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/helldivers-2/arrowhead-next-game-without-sony"">Helldivers 2 dev says it will call ""100%"" of the shots on its next game</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/helldivers-2/update-weapon-customization"">Surprise Helldivers 2 update overhauls weapons as Super Earth comes under threat</a> ",1747832825,
