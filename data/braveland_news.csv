We made it free and collected all the creatures and heroes of the previous parts, and also added a lot of new ones! All in order to create the perfect old school turn-based strategy with Online Duels. The game has become larger and more difficult, the storyline will not give in so easily, and to collect all the creatures you will have to try hard. But now you can challenge any player in real online Duels and Cooperative Battles. And a small fee for royal chests with creatures will help us maintain game servers and develop Braveland Heroes. So, go ahead and start your quest in search of the stolen royal scepter. Gather your friends, create your clan and fight for glory in the vastness of Braveland! https://store.steampowered.com/app/931650/Braveland_Heroes/",1546533091,
