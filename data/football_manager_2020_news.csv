1100600,"FIFA's greatest obstacles? Thomas Müller, ugly football, and you","As of last Sunday the 2019/20 football season, pickled and zombified beyond its natural expiry, finally came to an end. Off the back of some alarmingly frantic games in the latter stages, the Champions League final promised box-to-box drama and defensive chaos, but ultimately played out exactly as all Champions League finals often do: two hours of nervy, methodical human chess, resulting in Bayern Munich's cranking mechanical stiflement of the gold-plated Paris Saint-Germain. The talisman of that great Bavarian mechanism was inevitable, at least to those who follow football. Thomas Müller, despite being an attacker and despite not scoring, was central to Bayern's plan, harrying and nibbling at PSG when out of possession and tugging and twisting their defence when his team had it. Now 30, Müller is emblematic of Bayern Munich and the German national team's near-perpetual success over the past decade. He's also, famously, a bit of a footballing enigma. A contradiction of a player who seems to scuff his way impossibly through games, all elbows and knees and loose-fitting shin pads. His success at the weekend, being a success of the most Thomas Müller kind, reminded me of <a href=""https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/2959703/fifa-17-player-ratings-system-blends-advanced-stats-and-subjective-scouting"" target=""_blank"">an article in ESPN</a> about the great obstacle his awkwardness tends to propose for a particular football game: by FIFA's standards, one of the best players in one of the world's best teams is, technically, not very good. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-24-fifas-greatest-obstacles-thomas-muller-ugly-football-and-you"">Read more</a> ",1598286670,

There is one major difference, though: while corners and free-kicks are aspects of the game that are coached rigorously from a young age, throw-ins are often neglected. This is madness as, on average, football teams get to take and defend around 50 throw-ins per game. That is a colossal figure, far too big just to ignore. The good news is, though, that (like all set-pieces) throw-ins can be improved upon both in terms of technique and positioning.

It’s not just about the excitement, though, as the success of a long-term save often hinges on your ability to bring through and develop youth prospects.

This comes with more detailed advice and suggestions on training, mentoring and loan time than ever before.

The answer is often related to how players and teams use ‘space’ differently; either in an attacking sense (creating it) or a defensive one (suppressing it). It’s why particular types of football are identified over time as ‘cultural styles’ or ’identities’. It’s why I’ve come to The Byline to talk about space in an attacking sense. Firstly, looking at why it’s important and then explaining how you can create and utilise space to your advantage.

This was certainly the perception in the early years of the role’s introduction with fans confused at the exact nature of the position. But, more recently we’ve seen many examples of a DoF working alongside a manager to propel the club forward; helping a manager to make key decisions and allowing them to focus more on tactics and team selection. While DoFs in the real world are increasingly commonplace, they are still perhaps underappreciated and underutilised in Football Manager. In FM, if you’re not utilising a DoF you’re, potentially, not becoming the best boss you can be. Read our Byline article on how they can help and why you should seriously think about employing one.

In this series finale we’re focusing on a side that are one of Germany’s biggest but have not lifted the title since 1958. You’ve got the chance to not just win the Bundesliga but create a dynasty from a team that oozes potential. The Ruhr region was traditionally the industrial powerhouse of Germany but industrial isn’t a word that can be used to describe Schalke 04, one of the region’s biggest teams. Die Königsblauen have a a squad packed with exciting young talent and look set to challenge for the top four in the coming seasons. Schalke fans might not have had a great deal to cheer about domestically, but the club has had enjoyed some success in Europe. They bagged the EURO Cup in 1996/97 and have made regular appearances in the knockout rounds of the both the Champions Cup and EURO Cup in recent years. Your ultimate aim should be to bring some European silverware back to the Veltins-Arena. You’ll be up against Schalke’s fierce rivals Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table and will initially be the underdog in that particular rivalry. Der BVB have a wonderkid-laden side of their own so overhauling them will be no mean feat. Here’s everything you need to know to make that happen. ",1592206980,

In this latest installment, we turn our attention to VfL Wolfsburg. Die Wölfe started life as a worker’s team for Volkswagen and after spending most of the 20th century in Germany’s lower divisions, they have been Bundesliga mainstays since 1997. Many tipped the club to drop straight back down the divisions after their initial promotion, but they thrived in the top-flight, regularly qualifying for European competitions and winning the league title in the 2008/09 season. In fact, Wolfsburg were the last side other than Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund to win the Bundesliga. Since then, the club have regularly competed with Germany’s elite and in 2015 they enjoyed their best year of the last decade, finishing second in the league, winning the DfB Pokal and lifting the Supercup before the start of the following season. Being the only club from the state of Lower Saxony and challenging the elite is the sort of mission Football Manager was built for. Here’s everything you need to know before kicking off your adventure at the Volkswagen Arena. ",1591979553,

The club were founded in 1904 by workers at the Pharmaceutical company Bayer AG and they’ve tried to maintain a link to their roots to this day, with Leverkusen nicknamed ‘Die Werkself’, meaning ‘The Company’s Eleven’. Despite their long history, they’ve never lifted the German title. Bundesliga regulars since 1980, they’ve mostly finished in the top half, aside from a couple of brushes with the drop zone, and more often than not in the top six. Domestically, their best achievements are five second-place finishes in the league and a single DfB Pokal triumph in 1993 over another team we looked at in this series, Hertha BSC. Leverkusen have had some great success in Europe, producing a dramatic comeback from a 3-0 first leg deficit to win the 1988 Euro Cup on penalties. They also became the first team to reach the Champions Cup final without having ever won a league title in 2002, losing 2-1. In recent years the club have focused on marketing themselves as a clean, family-friendly club. Harnessing that community support and ending their hoodoo in the league with a squad replete with wonderkids is a Football Manager dream scenario.

A club with a magnificent 50,000 seater-stadium which creates one of the nation’s finest atmospheres. 1.FC Köln were Bundesliga stalwarts until 1998 when they slipped into the second tier. Until that campaign, they’d been in the top flight since the Bundesliga’s inception and were the first team to win the title. They were crowned champions again in 1978, truly cementing themselves as one of the country’s fiercest clubs. 20 years later, they dropped down to the second tier. Looking back retrospectively like this makes that relegation seem so peculiar. The same can be said for their relegation in 2018 too, a year after securing a fifth placed finish in the Bundesliga. But those darker times are in the rear-view. The Billygoats clinched the Bundesliga 2 title at the first time of asking, securing a return to the big time. Now’s the time to look forward once more. Your job as manager in FM20 is to keep the team up, something that can be just as exhilarating as challenging at the top of the league, so read our Byline article for our full team report.

In their current guise, ‘The Iron Ones’ were formed in 1966 but, as they were based in the eastern part of Berlin, they only joined the Bundesliga league structure in 1990. Since then they’ve mostly played their football in the Bundesliga 2 and the 3.Liga and prior to 2019, their greatest success came in 2001, when they reached the DfB Pokal final as a third-tier outfit, losing 2-0 to Schalke 04 in the final. This is a club where the fans are everything. They volunteered to help rebuild the stadium’s crumbling terraces in 2008, ensuring that they didn’t have their professional licence revoked. Others united behind the ‘Bleed for Union’ campaign, putting the money they received for giving blood towards a fund that helped the club stave off bankruptcy. Their immense loyalty was rewarded with success in the 2018/19 season, when they made good on a 17-game unbeaten run to start the season, finishing third overall and defeating VfB Stuttgart in the play-off to secure a first-ever promotion to the top-flight. Second clubs in cities always find a place in the heart of the romantic football fan, and with the tide of history on your side, they’re the perfect candidate for a new save.

Hertha Berlin are the city’s most popular club and one of Germany’s oldest but it’s been nearly 90 years since they were last crowned German champions.

Anyone who has pre-purchased FM20 from a SEGA-approved digital retailer* can log into Steam and launch the Beta from their Steam library, right now. It’s not too late to get access to the pre-release Beta either; as anyone who pre-purchases FM20 on PC and Mac between now and the game’s release on Tuesday, November 19th (from a participating digital retailer) will see the Beta immediately added to their Steam library. The pre-release Beta is a near complete (but not quite final) version of the game, so players may encounter some bugs and issues during play. These can be reported directly to the Sports Interactive team via the ‘Report Bug’ button on the in-game sidebar. Online play is also enabled, but there will be no access to the Steam Workshop or either the pre-game or in-game editors until the game’s full release on November 19th. With new features concentrating on player development (through the Playing Time Pathway and Development Centre) and each club’s unique identity (via Club Vision), FM20 looks set to be the most engrossing entry in the long-running series’ history. “The Beta should have been out on November 5th,” says Sports Interactive gaffer, Miles Jacobson “but given how many of this year’s features are aimed at long-term play, we wanted to give people an extra weekend to play and their feedback in. This will help us with the final development push for polish ahead of the release on the 19th, for what is already the best game in the series.” All players, including the more casual, can look forward to a raft of quality of life improvements that will make their lives easier and help them get the most out of their time on the game, alongside a number of great graphical and AI changes in the famed Football Manager match engine. Single player careers that are started on the pre-release Beta can be carried over to the full release, making this the perfect time for managers to kick-off their long-term saves. For more information on FM20 and the game’s features head over to www.footballmanager.com *The pre-release Beta is available from SEGA approved digital retailers only; please check here for an exhaustive list of digital retailers and more details as to what constitutes a SEGA approved retailer.
