Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Eduardo Aparicio, Borderlands 4 Senior Technician on the Release Compliance Operations TeamEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Eduardo Aparicio, 2K’s Senior Technician on the Release Compliance Operations Team:What’s something you wish more teams understood about the release pipeline?Eduardo: Releasing a game, an update, or post-launch content is more often than not a long and sometimes tedious process, albeit very rewarding in the end when releases go smoothly and people end up buying and loving our games! There are so many variables and conversations that have to happen and be taken into consideration way too early in advance before our wonderful games go on sale in stores or on 1st Party platforms. As such, the Release team dedicates extra time making sure that our deadlines and key dates for each project milestone are communicated to all teams in a timely and formal manner so we can submit code and metadata on time and accommodate our 1st Party deadlines. It is funny because some people believe we just push buttons and then voilà, the game is out! But most of our work is actually ready to go a couple of weeks before an actual release.As a Release Senior Technician, one of the several tasks I'm in charge of is reviewing and processing game documentation, images, videos, localized metadata copy, keywords, pricing... the so-called ""metadata deliverables."" My team is responsible for reviewing, processing, and populating hundreds of unique metadata files across all platforms, and this meticulous submission process must be completed well ahead of schedule. Delays are our greatest obstacle; they feel like unexpected side quests that pull focus and demand hours of work before we can continue the main story.What path brought you into release engineering and build management?Eduardo: In my previous co...",1765570954,

Today’s update includes support for the addition of Bloomreaper the Invincible, True Mode, and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode 6. This comes alongside a variety of improvements across gameplay, summons behavior, gear, visuals. We’ve done a lot of work to boost performance, refine gear, and improve the splitscreen and menu usability in this update. Thank you for the continued feedback and reports that are being sent in.

True Mode scales up all enemies as if you were playing in a 4-player party, regardless of your current party size. That means your opponents will be tougher to take down, far more numerous, and have more Badass elites among their ranks.True Mode is found in the Session Settings menu and works independently of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, allowing Vault Hunters to have the most control over their difficulty. Added support for True Mode, a new difficulty that is always scaled for a party of 4 regardless of the amount of players. The change here ups that balance to provide a greater challenge to those who are ready to take it on. This new difficulty mode is available when a player has completed the campaign.Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode 6It is time for a greater challenge.Added support for UVHM 6Added new UVHM challengeAdded new Firmware: Skillcraft, only available in UVHM 6. Skillcraft tiers make your Action Skills even more dangerous to your enemies. Tier 1: Skill Damage +10%Tier 2: Skill Critical Chance +10%Tier 3: Dealing Skill Damage increases Skill Damage Dealt by 2% for 10 seconds.

1285190,Free Endgame Raid Boss Out Now!,"Brace yourselves for a deadly endgame encounter with awesome new Legendary loot. Borderlands 4's first raid boss has arrived as part of a free update for all players.Bloomreaper the Invincible is a corrupted god who lures surface dwellers into the depths of the abyss where their corpses feed its roots. This towering creep poses the ultimate challenge to any Vault Hunter, pushing your build and skills to the max. The new timed challenge system means the faster you take it down, the better the loot. Kill Bloomreaper quick enough, and you’ll get the coveted Platinum chest with an all-new Legendary weapon: Rainmaker. High risk, Legendary rewardsThe latest free update adds nine new Legendaries you can farm as dedicated drops: five new pieces of gear and four new Class Mods. But the majority of that new loot will only drop if you can beat Bloomreaper quick enough in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM), the amped-up difficulty setting you can learn about in our Borderlands 4 endgame explainer.This introduces a timer for your raid run, so do your best to deal death as rapidly as possible. When this ferocious flora finally bites the dust, you'll be rewarded with a chest full of loot including tiers of bonus rewards. Depending on your completion time, the Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum-tier rewards you get from this chest will be increasingly powerful. You'll be able to clearly see how much time you have left to hit a certain tier via your mission tracker.All of Bloomreaper's Class Mod drops are only available when achieving the Silver tier or higher in UVHM. And if you absolutely ace the Bloomreaper fight to earn Platinum-tier rewards, you'll score a guaranteed new Legendary drop: Rainmaker, a new Ripper Sniper Rifle with a massive magazine, high fire rate, and a chance to not consume ammo with each shot. To anyone seeking a Rainmaker of their own, all we can say is: good luck.Here's the full list of new Legendary loot you can get from the reward chest once you defeat Bloomreaper:Rainmaker - Ripper Sniper Rifle (guaranteed drop for Platinum-tier rewards in UVHM)Mantra - Maliwan ShotgunUndershield - Vladof ShieldUrchin - Tediore Ordnance (Grenade)Jett-Setter - Ripper Ordnance (Heavy Weapon)Misericorde - Siren Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)Overdriver - Exo-Soldier Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)Trooper - Gravitar Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)Lamplighter - Forgeknight Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)Raid boss requirementsBloomreaper presents the most difficult endgame challenge yet, so you'll need to complete Borderlands 4's story campaign before you even think about taking it on, and while there isn't a strict level requirement for this fight, you'd be wise to hit the level-50 cap. Just like the rest of Borderlands 4, Bloomreaper's health and damage will scale to your party's size and levels, but you should expect a highly challenging encounter whether you take on this fight solo or in co-op.The ""Invincible"" moniker is a throwback to the raid bosses of previous Borderlands games (so Bloomreaper isn't literally unkillable). You'll have to contend with its massive health pool and extremely lethal attacks in this multi-phase fight. Taking down this rotted, parasitic monstrosity isn't as simple as dumping tons of bullets into its corrupted stalks, as you'll need to traverse a deadly arena to avoid its attacks, grapple-leaping between a cluster of stone pillars above a seemingly bottomless canyon. Should you miss a jump or dive the wrong way in a panic, plummeting into that foggy abyss means instant death. Stay aloft, stay alive.Any Vault Hunters brave enough to battle Bloomreaper should check any of Kairos' major hubs for a new Raid Board, with a mission to eradicate this hideously overgrown weed in its perilous lair: The Bloom. More endgame contentBloomreaper the Invincible is just one aspect of Borderlands 4's endgame, which will continue expanding with future content updates. Near-term, the new Major Update that includes Bloomreaper also adds a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode - Level 6 for an added layer of difficulty to conquer. Looking ahead, we recently shared that we're developing an all-new Takedown raid that will be part of a free update for all players in 2026, featuring an extremely challenging gauntlet through a new area, including hordes of enemies and new boss encounters.Today's Major Update also includes the option to enable a new difficulty mode that scales up all enemies as if you were playing in a 4-player party, regardless of your current party size. That means your opponents will be tougher to take down, far more numerous, and have more Badass elites among their ranks. We're calling this new setting True Mode, which is found in the Session Settings menu and can be toggled on or off independently of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, giving you full control on just h...",1765472436,

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Rocio S., Borderlands 4 Senior Community ManagerEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Rocio S., 2K’s Senior Community Manager:What are the signals you look for when deciding which community issues to escalate to developers?Rocio:  There are so many things to look out for, this is a great question! And, unfortunately, there is no clear cut answer. The answer is ultimately: it depends.Because we have so many sources, a lot of what Community has to do boils down to:1) Identify the volume of the issue; not only that, but ""does everyone feel the same way?"" is a sort of universal conversation.2) Identify the source of the issue; is it everyone, is it a specific scenario, is it a specific game mode?3) Identify how consistent the issue is; is it sometimes, every time, one time?4) Identify how much impact the issue has; does it make the game unplayable, is it inconvenient, or is it a nice-to-have?From there, we work with the team to understand how much dev work it might take to resolve the issue, and to identify how much of an overall impact a change might make on the game. However! It always depends. Sometimes something may seem easy, but when it comes down to it, it turns into many more hours of work. Sometimes, something that starts as a small issue can become a larger issue over time. So really, this is all a constant process of reevaluation, consistent communication, and consistent feedback.What inspired you to get into community management in the first place?Rocio:. Honestly, like a lot of Community folks, I didn't intend to enter community management. My background was in art, and I fully expected to enter the games industry for art or design. I even made a portfolio! But I knew I wanted to enter the industry no matter what and I entered through an entry-level, contract customer support role.Then I sort of stumbled into community management—a role opened up, and I enjoyed it, but all while working on design on the side because I assumed that was where my passion was. It wasn't until I spoke to a lot of designers, artists, writers, QA, and more that I realized: I am right where I want to be.Community is at the nexus of so many disciplines. You interact with entire teams, learn about what they all do, and get an understanding of what the game is coming from and where a game can go. And, when you have a team that cares, you have just as much of an impact on the game as any other discipline.For someone who is always craving to learn something new, loves multitasking, and is a little bit everywhere all at once, the role just felt like a natural fit!Was there a moment early in your career when you knew “this is what I’m meant to do”?Rocio: Yes, actually. I was about two years into my career, had worked on the game I was on for just about a year, and had gotten into a pretty good flow.We were going over player feedback for a recent update, and my Product Manager at the time, in a room full of veterans, game designers, leads, turned to me and asked something along the lines of: ""Numbers aside, Rocio, what is the community saying?"" That day, after hearing community concerns and pain points, the team made a decision that the community loved, one that the numbers just ...",1764973200,

Since it isn't realistic for developers to fix every issue found at once, a lot of my time is spent running risk analysis on the issues we find to help developers prioritize what order to address items in. A lot of this also just comes down to talking directly with first party groups, reviewing historical trends, as well as looking through developer documentation and forums in the various first party portals.For me, achieving this goal comes down to collaboration and experience.

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Adam Fitzgerald, Borderlands 4 Senior ProgrammerEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Adam Fitzgerald, Senior Programmer at Gearbox:How do you bridge the gap between what’s technically possible and what creative teams dream up?Adam: The main thing is just to make sure the code team stays in the loop with everything designers are doing. From past experience, we've learned to be better about this by putting guardrails around some of the more powerful engine features, so designers have to ask a programmer for help or feedback earlier in the process. I'm always impressed with what they manage to cook up in spite of the restrictions. Our goal is to make the tools be self-documenting as much as possible, and to be easy to use the right way and hard to use the wrong way.Do you think of programming as craftsmanship, engineering, o...",1763760506,

1285190,"Major Update Notes - November 20, 2025","Welcome, Vault Hunters! Today’s update delivers some key community-requested improvements, smarter loot drops, and a new Legendary Loot Indicator for your radar. These are alongside major improvements, visual polish, and stability updates for a smoother experience on Kairos.Beyond today’s update, the team is hard at work on a host of other highly requested quality-of-life features. Work on Photo Mode is wrapping up, while other updates like support for multiple active Big Encore Machines and more options for scaling difficulty are coming (we’ll talk more about these closer to their launch). Further into the future, we’re looking at ways to improve shared character progression, add additional endgame-focused activities (did someone say Takedown?), launch Cross-Save support, and more.Now that we're post-launch, we want to break down how we deliver updates to you! We have two main kinds:""Minor Updates"" will take care of any smaller, more pressing issues outside of the planned update schedule (primarily balance changes, if needed). They also refresh the three types of Weekly Activities: the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Weekly Wildcard Mission, and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine location. Minor Updates are scheduled weekly on Thursdays.""Major Updates"" deliver larger-scale changes, including new content, more sweeping balance adjustments, performance improvements, and the addressing of any reported issues. Major Updates are less common, and are planned to deploy about a month apart.With all of today’s changes though, we hope you can feel the positive effects in gameplay as you experience How Rush Saved Mercenary Day and make progress on your Vault Cards! Change List:Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary DayWe're stoked for you to team up with Rush and teach Minister Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day! This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year. However, the team realized that there was more mayhem than time when it came to getting as much into Bounty Pack 1 as originally planned while never slowing down in their mission to improve the Borderlands 4 player experience. So in the spirit of the season, we're giving a gift to all Borderlands 4 players by making Bounty Pack 1 free!* Thank you for all the passion and support you've given us as a community. We're hard at work making sure future Bounty Packs are more fully loaded with the compelling content players have been asking for.

Playing Borderlands 4 with a Vault Card active gives you more loot and XP via Daily and Weekly challenges, and it can be leveled up at your own pace (no time limits or expiring rewards here). You can activate it via the Vault Card screen in your ECHO menu. Vault Card progression works just like leveling up: it's all driven by how much XP you're gaining. By exploring Kairos, killing enemies, and completing quests, you'll fill up your Vault Card progression in addition to your regular XP!This includes 4 new pieces of rerollable gear and 24 new cosmetics to earn!

You can read the full details here.Bounty Pack 5 is coming in 2026We're incredibly grateful that so many players committed to Borderlands 4's post-launch content by purchasing the Deluxe Edition, Super Deluxe Edition, or Bounty Pack Bundle. Now that Bounty Pack 1 is free for all players, we're making good on that promise of four premium Bounty Packs by adding an additional fifth pack. This means that players who purchased the Deluxe Edition, Super Deluxe Edition, or Bounty Pack Bundle are now getting a total of five Bounty Packs. With this new Bounty Pack all players can look forward to even more mayhem on Kairos in the year ahead. Keep an eye out for details on the next Bounty Pack in the new year!Bounty Packs* vs. Story Packs**This is also a good moment to reiterate the difference between the Bounty Packs and Story Packs that make up Borderlands 4's paid post-launch content.Bounty Packs bring new cosmetics, gear, and missions that culminate into an incredible boss fight! They're designed for early to mid-game players who are looking to add additional cosmetic flair to their Vault Hunters, with missions you can play at any point during your leveling journey. Narrative content and the overall theme will vary depending on the Bounty Pack. With a Vault Card active, you'll be leveling up your Vault Hunter at a quicker pace, and collecting additional cosmetics and gear all the while! In terms of scope, each Bounty Pack gets you a Vault Card's worth of new cosmetics and gear unlocked through gameplay (just like the Vault Cards from Borderlands 3's Director's Cut DLC), alongside new mission content that dives deeper into the lives of Kairos' memorable characters.Story Packs are our most substantial DLC, including a brand-new Vault Hunter, multiple main missions and side missions set in a new zone of Kairos, new gear to earn, and a bunch of new cosmetics. The first Story Pack for Borderlands 4 arrives in Q1 2026. Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned will feature the return of the indomitable fan-favorite Ellie alongside a cosmic horror theme with a bloodier, darker tone. Joining as a new playable Vault Hunter is C4SH, a former casino dealer bot with distinctly unpredictable Action Skills. Longtime Borderlands fans can think of Borderlands 4's Story Packs as a mix of the meaty Borderlands 3 DLC and their standalone stories, plus a new Vault Hunter with all the added gameplay experiences they provide. Just like Borderlands 4's base game Vault Hunters, C4SH and the other to-be-announced DLC Vault Hunter offer multiple build playstyles with their three unique Action Skills and branching skill trees. You can read the full details of all the content included in each Story Pack in our initial Post-Launch Roadmap article!Expanded endgame content, including a free TakedownWe're thrilled to see so many players making it to Borderlands 4's endgame content, and we've been floored by how many of you are wreaking havoc in the increasingly difficult levels of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.

You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Josh Maresca, 2K’s Senior Manager for Influencer and Creator Marketing: What’s your guiding principle when deciding which creators are the right fit, not just the right reach?Josh: I’ve always trusted my gut when it comes to spotting creators with that spark, no matter the size. I look at the quality of their content, how they treat their community, whether they’ve played our games or anything in the same ecosystem, and, honestly, whether they make it easy for us to contact them. Creators: please put a business email in your bio. It helps everyone!Follower count stopped being the main north star a long time ago. What matters is engagement, where they’re posting and how consistently they show up. A small TikTok channel can outperform giant ones if the right video hits the right algorithm. Strong content travels, and everything else is just surface area. How do you decide when to amplify an emerging creator who hasn’t “proven” their audience yet?Josh: Great content is proof. If someone is posting consistently and putting real craft into what they do, they’ll get noticed. All of us on the creator, community, and social teams share standout clips with each other constantly. That’s how newer voices end up on our radar and could end up being on our owned channels. What’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone just starting out in creator partnerships?Josh: Relationships and curiosity go a long way. Pay attention to content trends, learn the platforms, and build a network—whether you’re a creator or someone on the partnerships side. Even making your own content helps you understand the grind firsthand.This industry is smaller than people think. I still run into folks I shipped games with over a decade ago. It’s a bit like reconnecting with old Vault Hunters—you pick up right where you left off; you’ve just collected a whole bunch of side quests along the way.

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Caleb Kennedy, Borderlands 4 Lead Level ArtistEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Caleb Kennedy, Gearbox’s Lead Level Artist:When you’re building a space, what story do you want it to tell before anyone even plays it?Caleb: To create a space that’s believable and compelling, you need to give it a history. To do that, I like to give myself some questions to answer. Is this space inhabited? If so, by whom? How recently was it built? What was it built for? How is it maintained, supplied, and defended? Etcetera. Some of those answers are already there in the narrative, some of them can be inferred from world fiction, and some of them you just have to come up with yourself. In the world of Kairos, there are all sorts of interactions happening that provide great material to build those environmental stories on. The geography and landscape have been shaped by both cataclysmic events and deliberate terraforming, while the different factions that inhabit Kairos are in active conflict. That gave me and other artists a lot of fun opportunities to build up rich histories for spaces, which in turn provided a solid foundation to build on.How do you balance guiding the player’s path while still making the world feel alive and free?Caleb: Guiding a player is one of the most important tasks when you’re making a large, seamless world. In a more linear game, you have the luxury of being able to precisely control a player’s path. On Kairos, a player has a huge array of options when it comes to exploring, so we had to come up with a variety of tools to guide them toward objectives. Some options are straightforward, like roads, and those actually present an opportunity to enhance the liveliness of the world. By adding patrolling enemies and events along thoroughfares, we’re able to ensure the player encounters cool stuff while also creating a sense of a dynamic, populated world. We also like to pull the player off the beaten path and into the wilderness, though. In those cases, we take full advantage of landmarks to pull the player through space. When someone sees something big and cool, they want to check it out, and if our natural topography frames those landmarks and subtly funnels the player toward them, even better. Always keeping landmarks and reveals in mind when you’re constructing a world makes for good flow while ultimately still leaving the power and choice in the player’s hands.How has your relationship to space changed since you started making worlds for others to explore?Caleb: It’s hard to overstate how much creating virtual worlds has impacted the way I interact with the world around me on a daily basis. No matter where I go, there’s always a game developer voice in the back of my head analyzing the same things I’d analyze in a map I was working on or critiquing. How are points of interest framed? When I move through a given space, am I having to actively think about my route, or is the flow natural enough that I can proceed forward without too much effort? Is the design language consistent, or jumbled? Is...",1762549261,

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Jeff Mott, Borderlands 4 Test ManagerEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Jeff Mott, 2K’s Test Manager:What does “quality” mean to you beyond the checklist? How do you know when a game feels right?Jeff:  To me, quality means doing our best to meet customer expectations. It isn't about finding every bug anymore; that's an impossible task. Games are simply too big and they're ever-changing. It's about finding the bugs that matter and advocating on behalf of the customer to get them fixed.For me, achieving this goal comes down to collaboration and experience. There isn't a single person making this call; it's a discussion, backed up by data from multiple groups, to ultimately decide when something feels ready.How do you empower testers to think critically, not just follow test cases?Jeff: This is all about finding the right balance. When a tester is new or at least new to a project, they need more guidance. And test cases are great for that. It helps them get familiar with what they're testing and become more comfortable with the game while contributing to vital tests we need to run. Once they're settled in, you start to give them the freedom and encouragement to go out and test with less direction, while still guiding them to try new things. I think this is crucial for broad test coverage, as different testers have different talents. One tester might be great at finding issues with balance and enemy behavior, another may be a natural at finding ways to break mission progress. Helping them identify and realize what they're good at, then giving them the freedom and support they need to shine, is how you build a great test team.How do you personally handle the repetition and rigor of testing without burning out?Jeff: One of the keys here is to remind yourself that we're all people and that people need breaks. Even if you love your job, you need time to set the work aside and recharge the batteries. At the end of the day, we're making something fun that we get to put into the hands of other people to enjoy, and that's just awesome! The other key is to build a team where no single person is a point of failure. No one should feel like if they take some time off, everything will fall apart. If that's true, then you haven't built a strong team. Having a support structure where anyone can take the time off they need and not worry that they'll come back to a disaster is how you avoid burnout. And I'm proud to say I've got that kind of team around me. Community Creative CornerOur community members aren’t just gamers—many of you are also artists.

Steam Community ScreenshotsAs you take screenshots and drop them in Steam, we’ll round up a few of our favorites for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Philip Hebert, Borderlands 4 Principal ProgrammerEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Philip Hebert, Gearbox’s Principal Programmer:How do you define your role as a Principal Programmer? In other words, what does it mean to you beyond seniority?Philip:  Gearbox defines a Principal Programmer as a person with a deep mastery of at least one specialty. This usually comes with seniority but is not a requirement. I have worked on gameplay systems, specifically gear, on a majority of Borderlands games.How do you make sure engineering decisions empower (not limit) art and design teams?Philip: Borderlands' gameplay systems are designed to be flexible and content-driven. We also learn from previous games. This may mean removing the ability to do things because of performance and creating new and better ways of doing them. Community Creative CornerOur community members aren’t just gamers—many of you are also artists. Whether it’s cosplay, digital art, or some yet-to-be-invented medium, we’re your biggest fans. Check out this week’s hand-picked fan creations: deepestloverducknerdEVR//DFTdry_spaceeThat’s it for this week—with more updates, more chaos, and maybe a few surprises coming next Friday.

The long-awaited <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> patch notes Gearbox has been promising for weeks are finally here, just in time for the Horrors of Kairos Halloween event. They're largely focused on dealing with some of the ""unintended interactions"" that were leading ludicrous damage scaling and boss-melting builds, although there are some buffs and performance improvements to be found. But Gearbox has already confirmed that one of the most disappointing changes, one halting the ability to speed-farm bosses for big loot drops, was unintentional and will be reversed. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-4/update-vendor-cooldown-refresh-removed"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-4/shift-codes"">Borderlands 4 Shift codes October 2025</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-4/nerfs-update-delayed"">You've got one more weekend to enjoy Borderlands 4's most broken builds as Gearbox pushes back nerfs</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-4/bounty-pack-1-release-date"">Gearbox dates the first Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack, and Christmas is coming early</a> ",1761307559,

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Ashton Macaulay, Borderlands 4 Data Scientist LeadEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Ashton Macaulay, 2K’s Data Scientist Lead:What’s one weapon or mechanic that generated data you did not expect?Ashton: Look, we knew people were going to have fun killing Splashzone, but we didn’t know it was going to be THAT fun. You all have killed him a sh** ton. You’ve fought Splashzone 47 million times since launch. That’s almost double the next highest boss. He might be the unluckiest bastard on all of Kairos, and we have a guy that was abandoned by his own legs.Which in-game event or system generates the weirdest, most unpredictable data spikes?Ashton: It’s always the most vanilla events that end up surprising you. For me, it was seeing how many of you are out there at player level 1,000,000. I’m pretty sure we don’t have that… but a few of you are definitely getting there… somehow.Also, early on, the data team had an area of the game that we referred to as “Murder Canyon.” It was a low-level area, all the enemies had range weapons, and the players mostly had grey pistols. The edges were softened a bit, but it’s still pretty difficult, and it’s always interesting to look at the death data in that particular area.What’s one metric you’d track if you could invent it from scratch - no technical limits?Ashton: We’d really want to go full Timekeeper. So, let’s get a Bolt in you and we’ll measure your dopamine levels when that Legendary Wombo Combo drops. But seriously, I would love to know how people feel as they go through the tiers of our endgame. There’s only so much we can see quantitatively, but I’d love to ask: You just fought that boss ten times in a row, died 8 minutes in, and you’re going back for more. What drives you?

We've put together this overview of what to expect from all this incoming paid and free content:Paid DLC of Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day* (Nov 20)Free limited-time Seasonal Mini-Event: Horrors of Kairos (Oct 23 - Nov 6)Free Invincible Boss and additional Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level (December)Before we get into the nitty-gritty details, we want to say another heartfelt 'thank you' to the millions of players who have been enjoying Borderlands 4 thus far. Our journey alongside all you badass Vault Hunters is just getting started, and we've got tons of awesome paid and free content coming your way, along with more performance improvements on all platforms. With that, let's take a look at what's on the horizon for the denizens of Kairos!Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day*On November 20, 2025, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will get you into the holiday spirit as Borderlands 4's first Bounty Pack! As a quick refresher, Bounty Packs are paid DLC that bring new bite-sized-yet-flavorful narrative content to Kairos, along with new gear to earn and cosmetics to collect—plus a Vault Card that lets you unlock additional loot through gameplay. How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is the first of four Bounty Packs included in the Bounty Pack Bundle. The Bounty Pack Bundle comes with the Deluxe Edition and Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 4 and is available for separate purchase.Rush, the affable leader of the Outbounders, is feeling homesick and nostalgic for the holidays he's cherished in years past. By his calculations, it's about to be Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family, and he'd like to bring that same festive cheer to the people of Kairos. But his hopes for holiday merriment stand in direct opposition to Screw, the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture who's charged with keeping celebrations as bland and homogenous as possible. Across a series of all-new Main Missions, you'll show Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day by any means necessary, and maybe score some new Legendary loot in the process.Bounty Pack 1 also includes a Vault Card with new rewards that you'll earn through gameplay, with 24 cosmetic items to unlock and 4 pieces of rerollable gear on offer. The rerollable gear can be earned as many times as you like, so you can snag a roll with stats that perfectly suit your build! Here's the full breakdown of the Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot: 4 rerollable weapons 4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe5 Weapon Skins5 Vehicle Skins4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins2 ECHO-4 AttachmentsPlaying Borderlands 4 with a Vault Card active gives you more loot and XP via Daily and Weekly challenges, and can be leveled up at your own pace (no time limits or expiring rewards here).

You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Brooke Smith, Gearbox’s Producer:What’s something fans might not realize about what producers contribute towards the development of a game?Brooke: This is tough, because producers often wear so many different hats!There's a stereotype that producers only care about the schedule and that we exclusively live in spreadsheets. While we definitely do care about the schedule and utilize spreadsheets, we also contribute creatively! For me, working with Systems designers, that meant helping designers brainstorm ideas, joining in on playtests, and helping come up with creative solutions to any problems that came up in development.How do you help ensure that creative and technical teams stay aligned?Brooke: With a game as big as Borderlands 4, it was important for our creative and technical folks to sync on a regular basis. My goal is always to make sure developers are comfortable communicating directly with one another, even if they are in totally different disciplines. I'll also always encourage cross-disciplinary playtesting, even in the early stages of development. Seeing a feature or mechanic in action and experiencing it as a team helps get everyone on the same page and helps get them excited about whatever we're ...",1760122931,

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Julian Molina, Borderlands 4 Release Operations ManagerEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Julian Molina, 2K’s Release Operations Manager:What’s one behind-the-scenes challenge of game releases that players might not realize?Julian: There are many moving pieces that are needed in pretty much every aspect of the release process that require a lot of people pitching in. As the person who leads the submission process for the publisher side, I get to talk to a lot of different people in different disciplines, getting their insight and aligning folks to the same goal - connecting our players to 2K and our games, through the medium of the First Party store pages. The challenge is working with a lot of minds; everyone has their own views and perspectives, but in the end it's pretty rewarding for everyone involved, as we all get to pull together to hit these achievements time and time again.What’s the most rewarding part of your role when you see a release go live?Julian: The process of getting our titles prepared for release starts out on paper. It's intangible and just a plan of action, so the thing I love seeing is the actualization of content coming to life. It doesn't get old, even after 40 titles during my time here at 2K. I also like actually playing most of our games (which I would play even if I didn't work here), so it's fun to be a part of the process, and see people enjoy and comment on everything. I also like to see players’ responses to everything, good or bad, as it gives me a view of what it is that people want from our world here in gaming, and tempering even my own expectations.Do you remember the very first game launch you worked on? What was that experience like?Julian: I started in the industry as a QA tester in 2016 working on a big release which admittedly was a fantastic introduction to 2K. In my current role in Release Operations, the first game I had ever submitted and helped release was a sports title back in 2018. It was a completely new world compared to QA testing, but it really sparked my interest in looking at the totality ...",1759519947,

1285190,"Borderlands 4 Update Notes - October 2, 2025","This update includes some additional balance changes and updates for Vault Hunters.Welcome to our first significant balance patch! Our high level goal for Borderlands 4 is to always provide players with the tools and means to build their perfect Vault Hunter. Through the combination of gear, Firmware, Skill and Specialization trees, we want players to experiment and craft theories, then put them to the test in combat. For today's update, we wanted to focus on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon in particular gets a host of adjustments to bring him closer in line with the general power level of the other Vault Hunters. Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power see adjustment to make those builds more viable in the late endgame. Finally, Harlowe has a couple tweaks to make sure Stasis is getting value for players. Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity. We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.   We're excited about the future of Borderlands 4 and its upcoming Post-Launch Roadmap. This is just the start of an exciting year of updates and content, and we can't wait to experience it all with our community.

The more hours I pour into BL4, the more I'm convinced that it's not just one of the <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters"">best FPS games</a> of this year, but one that has the potential to stand alongside the first two entries as an all-time favorite.

1285190,"Meet C4SH, a robot Vault Hunter coming to Borderlands 4","A roll of the dice, a flip of a card, a spin of the bullets in a chamber—these are among the random chances that fascinate C4SH, the first of two new Vault Hunters coming to Borderlands 4 as part of the paid Story Pack* DLCs. Here are the ways you can add C4SH to your roster of playable Vault Hunters as soon as he's available:Own Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe EditionOwn the Vault Hunter Pack (included in Super Deluxe Edition)Own Story Pack 1: Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned (included in Vault Hunter Pack)Revealed during the Borderlands 4 panel at Tokyo Game Show 2025, C4SH is included in the first Story Pack, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, which is planned to launch in Q1 2026. This Story Pack is one of many additions outlined in our Post-Launch Roadmap, and features multiple main and side missions set in a new zone of Kairos, the brand-new Vault Hunter C4SH, new gear to earn, and a bunch of new cosmetics to collect.A former casino dealer bot, C4SH is now a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts. As luck would have it, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favor.Like the other Vault Hunters in Borderlands 4, C4SH has three unique Action Skills to choose from, and can enhance his abilities via three skill trees that each have three branches full of powerful passives and ways to customize his Action Skills. But C4SH's Action Skills are distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance. We'll be revealing the full details of his Action Skills later on, but C4SH's risk-reward playstyle can lead to good fortunes like buffing himself and allies, dealing devastating damage, sapping the strength from foes, and more.Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, including C4SH, is the first of two content-filled Story Packs coming to Borderlands 4. The simplest way to get the most paid post-launch content is with Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition, but you will also have the option to purchase the Story Packs individually or get them bundled in the Vault Hunter Pack.Owning the Vault Hunter Pack also gets you the Ornate Order Pack, which includes a total of 12 premium Vault Hunter cosmetics usable right away. You can learn more about the Ornate Order Pack and other customization options in our Cosmetic Item Offers article.Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned is just one of the many pieces of paid Borderlands 4 content, but you can also expect plenty of free content updates as outlined in our Post-Launch Roadmap. All players can look forward to free Updates that will introduce Seasonal Mini-Events, Invincible Bosses, and more. There are also the paid Bounty Packs** including new bite-sized-yet-flavorful narrative content, new gear to earn, and cosmetics to collect—plus a Vault Card that lets you unlock additional loot through gameplay. Four Bounty Packs are included in the Bounty Pack Bundle that comes with the Deluxe Edition and Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 4.Keep on the lookout as we reveal more about Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, including gameplay footage of C4SH in action, over the coming months!

Enjoy the beauty of chaos - er, I mean, Kairos!Behind the Team: Brandon Schulz, Borderlands 4 NPC DesignerEvery week, we’re spotlighting one of the minds behind the mayhem. You’ll get to learn about folks from both Gearbox and 2K, and how each person who touches the game both influences and is influenced by Borderlands 4. This week, we're talking with Brandon Schulz, Gearbox’s NPC Designer:How do you approach creating characters that feel alive in such a wild, over-the-top universe?Brandon: So much of what makes the Borderlands universe so wild and over-the-top are the characters themselves. In that way, our Narrative team makes my job easy when it comes to making those characters feel alive in gameplay—we simply take their wackiest, most unique characteristics and translate them into player-facing NPC mechanics. For example, Amara is known as the world-famous ""Tiger of Partali,"" a ruthless (but also flashy) fighter who is often characterized by her ability to conjure six individual Siren arms: as such, when designing her NPC combat abilities for BL4, we made sure to emphasize that ruthless-but-flashy fighting style not only by referencing what players already know and love about playing her in BL3, but also by taking inspiration from fighting games that personify hand-to-hand combat so well.What’s the balance between narrative goals and gameplay needs when designing characters?Brandon: Generally speaking, we find that balance by starting with two constraints: 1) What is needed from a gameplay standpoint, and 2) What makes sense given the narrative background for that NPC.With that, we essentially create a Venn Diagram with those constraints on either end, and start brainstorming ideas that hopefully land in the middle where there is an overlap. Sometimes the lines need to be fudged a bit on one side or the other—it can be a bit of a push and pull process—but ultimately in the end we’ll always go with whatever sounds/feels the most fun. From there, it’s all about playtesting, iterating, and responding to feedback until the NPC feels both mechanically satisfying and narratively authentic. Community Creative CornerOur community members aren’t just gamers—many of you are also artists. Whether it’s cosplay, digital art, or some yet-to-be-invented medium, we’re your biggest fans. Check out this week’s hand-picked fan creations:- rottenzone- krotiation- flippythedog200 That’s it for this week—with more updates, more chaos, and maybe a few surprises coming next Friday.

Lighting a scene, adjusting the camera angle, changing an enemy type, or using a different location all contribute to getting a great shot. We try to keep every moment fun while also communicating what we want to show the player. Say we need to capture a unique weapon that feels fun to play - showing a detailed close-up of the weapon and then cutting to a high-energy combat gameplay shot keeps the action flowing and emphasizes the fun, while also communicating the features of the weapon to the player without compromising any visuals.What advice would you give to someone who is interested in working in game capture?Play lots of video games! Seriously, being a gamer is probably the biggest requirement for getting into game capture. Understanding how to play video games, what good gameplay should look like, and understanding what players expect in games are all essential to marketing them. This is one of those few jobs in game marketing where you are expected to play the game every day! ;) Additionally, having an educational background in visual art, film/TV, or game development will definitely set you ahead. At the end of the day, everyone in game capture is a gamer at heart. We love playing vi...",1758311638,

1285190,Borderlands 4 Quick Tips,"Welcome to Kairos, Vault Hunters! Borderlands 4 is available now—and as you, your co-op partners, and the rest of the Crimson Resistance get ready to undertake your mission to topple the Timekeeper's reign, check out this list of spoiler-free tips to help you loot and shoot to the fullest.If you'd prefer to start by getting a sense for what awaits on this mysterious, hidden planet, you can get a general overview on the Borderlands 4 Game Info page, dive right into theorycrafting the perfect builds for Vex, Rafa, Amon, or Harlowe via their Vault Hunter pages, or meet the talented actors behind each of their English-language voice performances! Remember to use your Repkit when taking damageWhether you're running low on health or just need a temporary buff to survive a firefight, don't forget to take full advantage of your Repkit. Along with instant restoration of some health points and an additional amount of regeneration over time, Repkits can provide helpful survivability boosts like reducing incoming damage for a short duration. Just keep an eye on its cooldown in the lower-left corner of your HUD and remember there's no downside to triggering it as often as you might need.Utilize your Ordnance as often as possibleIn Borderlands 4, the new Ordnance slot is where you can equip your hardest-hitting munitions, including different types of Grenades and Heavy Weapons like rocket launchers, massively powerful machine guns, and colossal energy cannons. Unlike previous Borderlands games, these don't consume ammo and can be activated any time they're off cooldown! To maximize your damage output, let that Ordnance fly as often as possible to make short work of the opposition!Use your movement abilities to dodge incoming attacksBorderlands 4's Vault Hunters can move like never before, darting around the battlefield by double jumping, gliding, dodging, grappling, and more. Dodging is especially important during boss fights, as incoming damage will be especially dangerous—but a lateral dash or a quick double-jump can get you out of harm's way without interrupting your barrage of bullets! Use elemental damage to tear through enemiesElemental damage types are among the most common modifiers you'll find on the bazillions of guns in Borderlands 4. At the most basic level, all guns can deal six types of damage: Kinetic, Incendiary, Shock, Corrosive, Cryo, and Radiation.Think of Kinetic Damage as the baseline, as it will deal the same amount of hurt to enemies regardless of their type. But properly matching elemental damage types against the different kinds of enemies you'll encounter can give you a big boost in lethality. Note that minding elemental types is less important if you're playing on Easy difficulty, and extremely important if you're playing on Hard difficulty (which is the default for the endgame Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode) where enemies have tougher elemental resistances but are more susceptible to their elemental weakness.Incendiary is most effective against enemies with red health bars denoting Bio. Burn your targets with damage over time until ashes are all that's left.Shock damage is most effective against enemies with blue health bars denoting Shield. Stun these shielded hostiles into submission with the voltage of Shock. Corrosive damage is most effective against enemies with yellow health bars denoting Armor. Melt through your opponents' defenses and disintegrate their hopes of survival.Radiation damage causes enemies to explode and is also effective against enemies with blue health bars denoting Shield, albeit slightly less so than Shock. Blasting a barrage of Radiation is excellent for taking out large groups, as it deals damage over time in an area and makes affected enemies violently explode when killed.Cryo damage can freeze enemies and is also effective against enemies with yellow health bars denoting Armor, albeit slightly less so than Corrosive. This chilling damage is ideal against tanky targets: freezing tougher enemies will make them lose health over time relative to their maximum HP.Reclaim Silos to aid your search for Vault Key FragmentsFrom Order patrols to world bosses, there’s always something to shoot and loot as you explore Kairos. You'll also come across short gameplay experiences and new activities that auto-grant a tracked mission whenever you discover them—like Silos, which house old, decommissioned Order tech that you can hijack for the Crimson Resistance with the help of your ECHO-4.Once you've reclaimed a Silo, it will reveal the approximate location of a Vault Key Fragment. Reclaimed Silos release a hacked communications balloon that you can zipline up to start gliding through the air towards your next objective, and they can also be used as Fast Travel points!Collect Vault Key Fragments to open Primordial VaultsThrough exploring and treasure-hunting, you'll eventually track down enough Vault Key Fragments to assemble your very own Vault Key.
