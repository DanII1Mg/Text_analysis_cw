3564740,Hearts unite as the winds meet,"It has always been thrilling for us to see you leave the bamboo abode and embark on your journey into the world of Jianghu in Where Winds Meet. Just like your first encounter with Jianghu, our initial attempt to connect with players around the globe has been both exciting and uncertain. But our passion and commitment to creating a living open world drive us forward, and your response and support to our efforts has been a tremendous encouragement, giving us the confidence to keep pushing ahead.Since launch, we have been listening closely. Your feedback, suggestions, frustrations, and encouragement have all been taken to heart, and we are actively addressing any areas where the experience has fallen short. While there is still much work to be done, we kindly ask for your patience as we continue to develop this world together with you.Actions speak louder than words. To address the current issues affecting your experience, our development team is working tirelessly to optimize these concerns. Here are the initial progress we have made: For network connectivity, we've fixed the routing issue that caused some players in Europe, the Middle East, and certain regions to be connected to non-local servers, resulting in high latency. We will continue to monitor post-fix data and player reports to ensure optimal performance.The issue of high network latency in Online mode has been resolved, and the issue in Solo mode is expected to be fixed in the mid-December update.Regarding text localization and voiceovers, we've revised many translations to make them more idiomatic and easier to understand. Additionally, we've optimized dubbing and subtitles in various story quests. We will continue to refine the localization of the game to make the Jianghu more immersive.In terms of the interface, we've improved the beginner tutorial, enhanced character customization, and refined English clues for puzzle-solving quests.These are just some examples of the key optimizations. For more details on fixes and improvements, please stay tuned for our official announcements.Looking ahead, we're committed to ongoing improvements in other key issues that concern you most including text localization, PS5 compatibility, and multi-character creation features.Optimizing multilingual localization is a continuous effort, and we’ve received many impressive translation suggestions through our open channels. We plan to launch co-creation events in the future, allowing your voice to shape the world of Where Winds Meet.For the PS5 platform, we’re working hard to enhance frame rates, stability, and visual quality. You can expect to see these gameplay improvements within the year.Regarding multi-character creation, we’re addressing platform restrictions and actively seeking solutions to meet your expectations.Over the next two months, we will gradually roll out several updates, including Steam Deck compatibility, optimized multi-timezone display, split outfit customization, PS5 Pro support for PSSR, enhanced audio experience, and more. Our goal is to create a Jianghu that everyone can enjoy, and we welcome any further suggestions you may have.Your support keeps us moving forward on this exciting journey that is just beginning.
