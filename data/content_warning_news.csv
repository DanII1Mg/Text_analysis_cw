2881650,Small update! Mod support and fixes 👻,"Hello SpöökTubers and welcome to a small update! In this patch, we have some fixes but most importantly we have added mod support via the Steam Workshop! Patch Notes: Added Controller support (rebindable using SteamInput) Steam Workshop support for mods Fixes A bunch of defibrillator fixes, for example not being able to speak after being rezzed Fixes related to the extraction failing when you try to get your video Expanded shadow settings allow for higher-quality shadows Made tooltips correctly display rebindable keys Made select items 1-3 rebindable Matchmaking now prioritises lower ping matches Why mod support? When we launched CW there were immediately a bunch of really cool mods being made, so we're super happy to make it possible for those mods to be on the Steam workshop! The CW team is small and doesn’t have enough capacity for continuous updates alongside their other work, so having mod support is a great way to empower the community to create cool new stuff! We had hoped to have this up and running earlier but it took a little longer than expected. If you are a modder, here is the current documentation for creating and uploading mods: https://github.com/landfallgames/ExampleCWPlugin There’s also an unofficial modding Discord you can join to find out more about Content Warning mods. We can’t wait to see what kind of mods you all create! Re the video extraction issues: In the last couple of patches we, with your help, solved several issues that led to videos failing to extract. We want to thank everyone who sent in logs and other information to help us fix as many of these bugs as possible. There are sadly a million things that can lead to extraction issues for the videos, some of which we have no control over on our end (like one team-mate having a weird file structure on their computer) but we have done our best to fix the most common ones. If you are still having issues after this update please reach out to our support at support@landfall.se so we can help troubleshoot. Future updates: As we spoke about in our last patch, the dev-team is made up of five developers who took some time off from their main project to work on Content Warning. The other project has been in the works since 2021 together with a bigger team, so it’s important to the devs that they come back to finish it. As we explained in our latest post, they won’t work more on CW during this time. Therefore, we don’t know when or if there will be more Content Warning updates. That said we’re very happy with what Content Warning has become! It’s been a wild ride for a six-week project that blew all of our expectations out of the water. We’re thankful to you all who have been on this journey down to the old world with us so far, and we can’t wait to see what mod support brings! Finding games: If you’re having issues finding other players, we recommend checking out our Discord where you can find others to play with https://discord.gg/contentwarning Ports: We’re working with a porting studio to get the game onto other platforms, so we hope to have more news about that next year. Porting also means we will add achievements for PC!

2881650,Content Warning proves you can give away a game for free and still make people want to buy it as it hits 1 million copies sold,"Turns out that you can give away a game to 6.6 million people, and still sell a ton of copies too, as that's exactly what <strong>Landfall</strong> has done with <strong>Content Warning</strong>. Right at the start of the month, <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/content-warning-takes-internet-by-storm-free-on-steam"">Landfall released Content Warning</a>, a Lethal Company style game about filming your friends getting killed by cryptids, as a sort of April Fool's day bit. The best part was that it was completely free for an entire day, and that resulted in 6.6 million players picking it up. A number like that shows you how ridiculously popular the game quickly became, and now as shared by Landfall on Twitter, it seems that popularity has shown no sign of slowing down, as the game has managed to sell a further one million copies on top of having given it away for free. That means a whole bunch of people were happy to pay for the game, which is surely a good sign for the game's future. Sure, you can have a viral hit if you're an established developer known for their funny games, but you still need to be able to make money, and it seems like Landfall will be fine in that department. The game was only made in a matter of months, and while it isn't quite as fleshed out as Lethal Company is just yet, Landfall did also promise that it has some fun updates (and fixes) on the way. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/content-warning-hits-1-million-copies-sold?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1713103703,

If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company"">Lethal Company</a> in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral ""SpookTube"" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of ""cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation"" and ""cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views"". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success. <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/content-warning-devs-fixing-mic-video-and-connection-problems-after-wild-ride-of-a-launch?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1712147511,
