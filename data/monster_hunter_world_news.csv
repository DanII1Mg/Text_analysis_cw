582010,Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark – Live Now!,"Hey hunters, How’s it going? February is here, which means we are officially in the launch month of Monster Hunter Wilds! On February 28, your journey into the Forbidden Lands begins. Now, to help ensure you have a satisfying, fun experience come launch, we’re pleased to share that the Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark we’d previously mentioned we were looking into, is real, it’s ready and it’s live from right now for you to try! With the Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark, we want to help our PC players feel more confident about how their PC will run Monster Hunter Wilds. In the next section, we’re going to explain what the Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark is, how it works, as well as some important information and differences you’ll see between this and the Open Beta Test 1 and 2 experiences, so please take a moment to check it out. Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark Breakdown! The Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark will allow you to see how the near-launch version of the game will run on your rig, via watching a demo play out. Please note, this occurs via a demonstration, so you won’t actually be playing the Benchmark yourself, nor have access to Character Creation. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/6c24700d75fee30a4a067cbd91b26bdc64a3b445.jpg We were keen to create this for you, following the community feedback on performance and optimisation we saw from Open Beta Test 1. Now, here comes that important part we just mentioned: Open Beta Test 1 was a much older version of the game’s build, and not representative of the current state of the full game’s optimisation when the beta occurred, nor what it is currently like now. Open Beta Test 2 will also be running on that same, old build, but with a bit more content included, such as Arkveld and Gypceros, so please don’t expect any performance differences there, nor anything we covered in the Pre-Launch Community Update (which we’ll link at the end of this post). Those improvements and adjustments, including optimisation and weapon changes, will be in the game Day 1 at launch. This means that neither Open Beta Test 1 or 2 are representative of the experience you’ll have when the game launches, so please don’t base your optimisation / performance expectations on those. Instead, please download and give the Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark a spin and you’ll get a much more accurate and reliable insight into how your PC will run the game at launch. General Info You can download the Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark directly from Steam with the link below: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/ Install Size: 29 GB Length: Around 6 minutes Benchmark Flow: Title Screen -> Performance check whilst displaying a demonstration -> Results screen. A score will be provided based on the performance of your PC (see below for gradings). Note: There’s no character creation available. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/99f2b8bca590732fdb71c742d996b994d924cbad.png The Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark isn’t just one setting though, we recommend using the Options menu to adjust game, graphics, audio and language settings to try out different combinations, or most accurately reflect your preferred settings come launch. There’s also a Loop setting that can be used to automatically rerun the benchmark. When it’s set to ON, the benchmark will automatically rerun after 1 minutes have passed on the results screen. Please be aware that the Option menu you see in the Benchmark is not exactly the same as the launch version, also, any settings you adjust here won’t be transferred into the main game. It’s worth noting that the benchmark may not be able to run properly if your computer does not meet Monster Hunter Wilds minimum requirements, which are available on the Store page! And one last, important point to share with you before we wrap up this post. The Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark does not guarantee the performance of your system for Monster Hunter Wilds, but does give you better insight and information, especially when compared to playing Open Betas 1 and 2. To Summarise The Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark is live! It’s free to use and you can download it HERE. A way to experience the state of optimisation for your PC in the production version of the game. It’s adjustable to give you information that reflects your preferred settings choices. The OBT 1 & 2 builds are old and do not reflect the current state of optimisation and performance. The OBT 2 build does not include any of the Pre-Launch Community Update improvements, they’re coming Day 1 at launch. That pretty much wraps things up, all that’s left is for those of you that want to try the benchmark ahead of launch, is to download it and give it a go! If you had unexpected performance issues in the Open Beta Test, or just want to make sure you’re PC is ready to rock, we highly recommend running the Benchmark and watching the demo play through to get your results!

582010,Monster Hunter Wilds – Pre-Launch Community Update!,"Hey hunters, How’s it going? We’re here today to share with you the Monster Hunter Wilds – Pre-Launch Community Update! Since November’s Open Beta Test, the team have been busy reviewing the feedback we’d received and working hard to further improve the quality of the full game in-time for launch day. Now that we’re ready to share the details with you, including improvements and adjustments to performance, weapons, game mechanics, multiplayer functionality and more, we felt how better to hear it than directly from the team! Below you’ll be able to watch our Pre-Launch Community Update broadcast, where the Community Team are joined by Monster Hunter Wilds director, Yuya Tokuda and his translator, Patrick, who go into all the juicy details. The event comes in at a little over an hour and is packed full of important info that we’ve been keen to share with you! We’ve also included a text summary of the content below the video if you’d like a quicker read instead, however for the fully comprehensive update, featuring all of the content, video clips, context and discussions, we’d recommend watching the broadcast! Our Update To You, The Community! The Monster Hunter Wilds – Pre-Launch Community Update Please note, everything in this broadcast, as well as the summary text below is not final, representing work in progress and is subject to change. Also, the content revealed during the event does not cover everything the team is currently working on as we approach launch. The Summary! For those of you who prefer a written format, below you’ll find a summary of a lot of the points that were discussed during the event. Once again, please keep in mind that the slides and explanations below aren’t as in-depth as our broadcast, missing both the frequent video clip examples and director Yuya Tokuda’s commentary. But, they are in chronological order, so if you find a particular topic you’d like more info about, you’ll be able to find it pretty quickly in the broadcast if you take a look! Performance Performance was the first topic we addressed, knowing this one to be an important one for the community. We covered all platforms, including PC, which you’ll see alongside one of the consoles below: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/ed708066ee818906a939d3c118c48abeb24a9503.jpg What does this mean in relation to Steam? The team are working on improving the performance of the Steam version, including frame rate, even when using the same equipment specs that you may have used in the Open Beta Test, although it may vary depending on your setup. We’re also keen to share a very recent development that the team may be able to lower the recommended graphics board specs a little bit more! Once we’ve got accurate information and can lock this in, we’ll release any info on our official website and let you know! We also saw that some of you were concerned as to whether your rig would be powerful enough to run Wilds when it launches, so to hopefully help those of you with questions out, we shared that the team are currently considering releasing a benchmark tool, if possible. As above, we’ll keep you looped in on any further details here. Hitstop & Friendly Fire Hitstop, making your weapons and overall impact of the game’s weapons feel powerful. During the beta we saw comments that players felt could have a little more “oomph”, so the team looked into it and made some tweaks! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/9266b13f2bbc15ff1076998a6d46fef0e1c0cffc.jpg Weapons will now feel more responsive when landing attacks, especially with big moves and finishers for many weapons types. Director Tokuda shared that the reason for Hitstop initially being less impactful in the beta was due to feedback we’d received from players outside of Japan when World launched was that it was too strong / weighty, however it seems we had the opposite with the Wilds beta! He was deeply moved to think that the weighty action that is the hallmark of Monster Hunter has now been widely accepted around the world! There’s even an example of this in the broadcast with the Great Sword’s True Charged Slash unleashing a truly meaty chop! Regarding Friendly Fire, the team, even before the beta, had decided they wanted to tone it down some of its effects, even though this wasn’t fully reflected in the beta build. Actions such as the Gunlance’s Wyvern Fire and the Hammer’s Upswing have had their impact on other hunters toned down. The Gunlance’s Wyvern Fire was already toned down in this regard during the Open Beta Test, but the Hammer’s Upswing adjustments will be live in the launch version of the game. So, in a nutshell, whilst you won’t send allies flying, they’ll still be briefly knocked off their feet. The team would like to avoid novice players unintentionally giving their friends and fellow hunters big bumps without knowing, potentially causing some players to avoid multiplayer due to the disruptions these actions caused them in a hunt. We hope this change will bring new and experienced ...",1734624670,

582010,Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test – Introductory Guide!,"Hey hunters, The Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test is live now on Steam and runs until Sunday, November 3, 6.59pm PST / Monday, November 4, 2.59am GMT! Until the beta ends, you can head to the Forbidden Lands for an early taste of exploring and hunting your way through the game’s first locale, the Windward Plains. As we’re expecting hunters both experienced and new alike, we thought we’d put together a quick intro guide of the Open Beta Test to briefly cover some areas that may help you settle in a little bit quicker, but don’t worry, there’ll be plenty for you to discover in-game too! What’s in the Open Beta Test? The Open Beta Test consists of three main parts for you to play: Character Creation Story Trial Doshaguma Hunt Let’s take a look in what the three segments above means for you! Character Creation Character creator enjoyers rejoice, in the beta you’ve got access to the full Monster Hunter Wilds Character Creation feature, letting you create and customise both your hunter and Palico! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/fbc8e82294b498febc37f37bfe27064d55150e21.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/9db9de4fbd9aa0cbedc64bcc6d6517408c96a533.jpg The best bit about having access to Character Creation during this period? You’ll be able to import your hunter and Palico’s Character Creation data into the full game when it launches! Story Trial The Story Trial gives you the opportunity to experience an early story quest from Monster Hunter Wilds, introducing you to the game’s rich and mysterious story, as well as important characters and more! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/76dec6ed1225bc7a8d78283198aae4e06bb7caec.jpg Plus, it also serves up as a great way to introduce new players to both Monster Hunter Wilds, and the series as a whole, so if you’re brand new and this is your first Monster Hunter outing, welcome! You’ll be guided through the basics in an action packed introduction, getting you hunt ready, including meeting your Seikret mount companion, and helping you choose your first weapon with the guidance of Alma, your Handler! With 14 weapon types to choose from, feel free to take your time and find the one that really clicks with you! (Of course, this is in no way a permanent decision, you can change up what weapons you use whenever you like!) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/87581db667742af0749e6b5cf36c9e2c7f8d9ff0.jpg For more experienced hunters, there’s plenty for you here too. On top of what we’ve already shared about the story, it’s a great opportunity to regain the intuition you had during World / Rise, as well as getting to grips with Focus Mode! Doshaguma Hunt The Doshaguma Hunt gives you the opportunity to explore the Windward Plains and immerse yourself in the seamless hunting experience. You’ll be tasked with hunting an Alpha Doshaguma. This can be taken on solo, with the help of NPC Support Hunters, other players / friends, or a mix of players and NPC Support Hunters up to a party of 4. Hint: Doshaguma regularly form herds, meaning you’ll initially come up against a group of them! There are multiple ways to split an Alpha Doshaguma from the herd, meaning you won’t have to fight them all at once. One such way is to make use of the Large Dung Pods you’ll have access to, so don’t forget to use them! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/470f9f23c2c5019637847c2edb32b31e5115067d.jpg Of course, Doshaguma aren’t the only monsters roaming the plains. Balahara, Chatacabra and under certain conditions, the Apex of the Windward Plains, Rey Dau, will cross paths with you! You can also draw these monsters over to Doshaguma to invoke a Turf War and dish out extra damage. There’s also the option for you to go on and hunt these other monsters after taking down Doshaguma! On top of that, there’s an array of small monsters and endemic life existing in the locale, creating a living, breathing world that not only interacts with you, but also the environment and other creatures around it. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/dd69533253e71abe53af2dbe66272bd8c94a7886.jpg By the way, when you successfully hunt Doshaguma, you can keep going! The seamless gameplay experience in Wilds allows you to continue hunting and exploring after a hunt, or you can choose to head back to base camp, or one of your nearby camps! Whichever you fancy at the time! Solo / Multiplayer in the Beta Monster Hunter Wilds is a game that can be fully enjoyed solo, multiplayer or a mix of both and that’s reflected in the Open Beta Test! Both the Story Trial and Doshaguma Hunt offer both a solo and multiplayer experience, with multiplayer opening up at a certain point in the Story Trial and being available immediately in the Doshaguma Hunt. The game scales to the amount of players / NPC hunters in your party too, so you’ll always get a satisfying and rewarding experience, no matter your party size! There’s also crossplay in the Open Beta Test (and full game), so if you want to team-up with friends or family on other platforms, you can!

582010,Monster Hunter Wilds - Extra Info From Tokyo Game Show!,"Hey hunters, How’s the hunting? As you’ve probably seen, there’s been some rather exciting Monster Hunter Wilds news and info coming out of Tokyo Game Show 2024 recently, including a new trailer, Flagship monster reveal, more live gameplay, Dev Team interviews and yes, a release date!! Monster Hunter Wilds is launching on Steam on 28th February, 2025! Featuring the option of crossplay too, you’ll be able to play and hunt alongside friends and family, even if they aren’t on the same platform as you. Pre-orders are live now too, and come with some rather fetching cosmetic layered armour, but we’ll talk about that more at the end of the post, as we’ve got even more news and details to share that was revealed outside of our initial release date trailer. Before we proceed, just a heads-up, there will be some monster reveals below! Even more Wilds Info! Monster Hunter Wilds: 4th Trailer | Release Date Reveal (Extended Kut) You saw the release date reveal trailer, but have you seen the “Extended Kut”? If you haven’t already, you’ll want to watch to the end for a surprise nestled away at the end: That’s right, your eyes do not deceive you! The big beaked bird wyvern, Yian Kut-Ku, returns with a vengeance in Monster Hunter Wilds! How and when will you encounter them? That'll be for you to find out! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/08683fecf41b3f9980584236c677724a1e99c20b.jpg But that wasn’t the only surprise monster reveal we had… Can you smell that? Tokyo Game Show also saw the world first gameplay of the Scarlet Forest, as the team took us for a look at this lush locale, live! Whilst exploring the area and showcasing some hunting and endemic life interactions, the team came across Congalala! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/91550db5add801773a1bf0ad7ed29ae8448b422c.jpg This pink-furred fanged beast has a penchant for flatulence, will be kicking up a stink as it returns in Monster Hunter Wilds! (Seriously, it’s dangerous from both ends.) Congalala are also rather partial to mushrooms, so hunters are advised to keep watch of what it’s munching down, as each different type of mushroom it eats will change its attacks! For example, consuming a Toadstool will give Congalala poison breath, whilst Nitroshrooms will give its breath an explosive bite! Whilst these are returning monsters, they didn’t make an appearance in World, Iceborne, Rise or Sunbreak, which means they may well be new for many of you, so prepare yourself for their unconventional moves! Seamless Locale Transition With Monster Hunter Wilds, one thing we’ve been keen to highlight is the seamless experience you’ll be able to have with the game, whether that’s from base camp into the locale, exploration or moving directly from one hunt into the next. We’d seen the community’s questions around how and if this seamless gameplay also included moving between the game’s locales, and live at Tokyo Game Show 2024 the team confirmed that yes, you can seamlessly move between the game’s locales on foot, or your Seikret, with no loading screens, by moving directly from the Windard Plains into the Scarlet Forest, where they quickly encountered a Lala Barina! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/2080f07bf63426f15d88b6c5ef81768a7b2f9ab1.jpg Initially, you won’t be able to move between locales freely, however as you progress through the game’s story and new areas become available, this seamless travel will be yours to use as you please! 16-Players in a base camp! In Monster Hunter Wilds, 16 players are shown at base camps! Recently announced at TGS by Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, up to 16 of the players in a lobby will be displayed at the same time in each of the various base camps. Meet friends, chat, form hunting groups and more! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/fa58cfdeb9578a56930018f3ef74b4e59eb96232.jpg Seikret Customisation Another confirmation that came from our Scarlet Forest live gameplay stream at Tokyo Game Show was the reveal that yes, you’ll be able to customise your Seikret companion in Monster Hunter Wilds, with the team’s Seikret being shown to have a light cream and deep copper plumage! We haven’t revealed exactly how Seikret customisation works in-game yet, but rest assured, you’ll be travelling the Forbidden Lands in style!

582010,Journey Back into Monster Hunter World: Iceborne for our 5th Anniversary!,"Hey hunters, How goes the hunts? We recently celebrated the 5th anniversary of Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, so it feels like a rather cool reason to head back to the Hoarfrost Reach for some hunts, or if you’ve yet to experience Master Rank, discover this new land for the first time! Well, we’ve also got another reason for you, whether you’re already well settled into Seliana, or yet to make the trip from Astera! To get ready for the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds in 2025, you can earn some special Palico equipment with save data from both Monster Hunter: World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne! Oh yes! Two extra Palico equipment sets can be yours! One for having Monster Hunter World save data, with a second Iceborne inspired set also unlocking for hunters who have made some early progress into the expansion! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/8f61de4c8f63971639f4ab6f5c349bdccd3b8d7a.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/9e61ad65b14282c8ea69a0ae0b1fd168cdeb857f.jpg Full details on how this will work for you here on Steam can be found HERE. Just scroll to the bottom of the page and any questions you may have on this feature will be answered! Welcome to the Hoarfrost Reach! With that, allow us to welcome you back to the frosty fields of the Hoarfrost Reach, your warm hearth within the cold, Seliana, and the step up to Master Rank hunts. If you haven’t picked up the Iceborne expansion or perhaps stopped at the conclusion of Monster Hunter: World’s story, let us highlight some of the early monsters you’ll face in Iceborne. Beotodus {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/80be48c3f8965dab84620dea700ebcff4a66fe69.png Diving deep within the snow and welcoming you to the Hoarfrost Reach is the piscine wyvern, Beotodus. When facing Beotodus, keep an eye on the snow to see where it might emerge from. Consider bringing an Iceproof Mantle or any armor with Ice Resistance. Weapons that can deal fire elemental damage can always give you a leg up in the hunt. Lastly, Nullberries are must to nullify the effects of Ice Blight. Something to become accustomed to right when you enter this new locale is to always have a Hot Drink on hand. Grab some of the Hot Peppers nearby and stay warm as frequently as possible, otherwise the ice-cold temperatures of the locale will soon take their toll on your maximum stamina! Banbaro {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/6045d566250c52eda5fa1fc74e405a6ba0fc1137.png Banbaro is the next challenge in front of you, a large and ferocious Brute Wyvern that can use its massive horns to charge through all obstacles, yes, including you, with reckless abandon. Banbaro’s relentless charge attacks and ability to grab boulders and hurl them at you can put in you in dangerous position, so stay agile as Banbaro will quickly close distance to attack, whether physically or throwing something heavy your way! Of course, if you’re rocking a weapon that can guard, there’s always the option to stand your ground! Like Beotodus, this monster can also inflict Ice Blight with some of its attacks, so keep some Nullberries to hand! Twists on familiar faces from the New World {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/653ad10bf7639dc7c127f621ffa29a1c71aab631.jpg Iceborne also features new versions of some monsters you may have already encountered in Monster Hunter: World. Here’s a selection of some you’ll face in your early Master Rank hunts: Coral Pukei-Pukei, Viper Tobi-Kadachi, Nightshade Paolumu and Fulgur Anjanath. We know many of you reading this post will be more than familiar with these monsters, but for hunters who’ve just made the journey across from High Rank, we’ll leave you to discover more about these monsters out in the field. We’re sure you’ll pick up on some clues in the names of these monsters, so prepare accordingly! Quest Complete – We’ll see you next time! That wraps up today’s post!

582010,Return to World #8 – Late and Endgame Tips!,"Hey hunters, How’s the hunting? It’s been some time since we last shared some hunting tips with you, but we’re back with some more tips to aid you on your journey through Monster Hunter: World’s late and endgame! Specifically, we’ll be looking at some of the fearsome Elder Dragons you’ll be facing and give you some slight pointers to see you on your way to success! The monsters we cover in this post are but one part of what World has to offer in the later stages of the game, so be sure to also check out the wide range of Event Quests (including our collaboration ones!), as well as the Kulve Tarroth Siege for some hunts with a twist that in some cases come with their own rewards, including a greater chance of encountering crown-sized monsters! The Pinnacle of the Hunt – Late & Endgame Hunters that have reached this point are likely to be well versed in how to hunt, crafting and upgrading their gear, as well as gathering useful supplies from the various locales that make-up the New World. However, we hunters are always growing and learning, so take this information and use it to sharpen your skills even further! Delving into the Elder’s Recess, you’ll face the powerful monsters that inhabit the Elder’s Recess (Yes, that includes Dodogama!) and come face to face with a range of mighty Elder Dragons, forces of nature that stand at the apex of the monster hierarchy! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/f2cbc25e052722d1405975df7b7579c3d0e254be.jpg Concept art depicting a hunter’s arrival into the Elder’s Recess. Elder Dragons! As mentioned, entering this stage of Monster Hunter: World means you’ll now be going toe-to-toe with against some of the toughest hunts in the New World. Elder Dragons are a rare species of monster that defy standard classification from the Guild, often possessing extraordinary destructive power than can cause natural disasters and other phenomenon. Oh, and traps won’t work on them either, these monsters can’t be captured nor stalled with these items. In short, it’s time to step up and prep your gear foe some serious threats. Having said that, Elder Dragons themselves provide parts that allow for the creation powerful new weapon and armour options, giving your hard-fought victories some sweet rewards! Now let’s get you covered with a few words of advice… Nergigante {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/3757fd0db1315c8c61cdcd7f96300c8033b3bcd4.jpg Nergigante, the flagship monster of Monster Hunter: World. You’ve traded blows before in Low Rank, but now it's time to finish what you started! Nergigante is a terrifying destructive force with a spike covered body. The key to overcoming this monster is doing your best to break its regenerating spikes that grow over its body. If not destroyed, they will harden over time and strengthen Nergigante’s offensive and defensive abilities! The biggest clue to deal Nergigante’s spikes is their colour! Fresh spikes are soft and white, but over time they darken and eventually become hardened black spikes. So, the trick here is to focus on destroying the spikes furthest along this process first, preventing them from reaching their final form! For those of you that love the satisfaction of breaking the different parts of a monster, you’ll be in for quite the satisfying fight! Just beware its devastating dive bomb attack, which can take you out in a single hit at this point in the game! If you’re looking to gear up specifically for this fight, consider using weapons with Thunder or Dragon element. Flash pods can also be useful here to interrupt some of Nergigante’s bigger hitting attacks. It’s also worth packing your Vitality Mantle for a quick respite when recovering from a big hit or helping defend yourself when Nergigante is on the attack! After successfully hunting Nergigante, you’ll be tasked with tracking down three more elder dragons in their specific locales, the Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste and the Rotten Vale. To track down these elder dragons and complete this assignment, you can follow a similar process to what you did during the ??? Rathian quest, however this time you’ll only gain progress for each specific Elder Dragon for any blue footprints you find, or High Rank hunts you complete in their associated locale. After a few High Rank hunts and a bit of gathering in each locale, the time will soon come to put your skills to the test once again… Teostra {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/97bb35fdaefa6bd3d37f84803a6797fbfdf74dcd.jpg Teostra is a fearsome elder dragon known for its control over fire and its explosive flames. Aside from its physical and flame breath attacks, Teostra can spread volatile powder which it can ignite at will, punishing hunters who linger near it. At times, Teostra will also wreath itself in flames, causing damage over time to hunters in its immediate vicinity. Equipping a Fireproof Mantle will fully negate both Fireblight and Blastblight and also reduce the damage you take from any flame breath attacks whilst worn!

582010,Return to World #7 – Tracking Down ??? Rathian!,"Hey hunters, How’re the hunts treating you? In this post we’ll be welcoming you into High Rank and providing some pointers to help you settle into the next stage of your adventure, including some advice on your first High Rank challenge, tracking down the elusive ??? Rathian! We know a lot of you hunters know exactly what monster this is, but for the sake of avoiding a quest spoiler for our newer hunters, we’ll leave discovering exactly which monster this is to you! Welcome to High Rank! If you’re now at this point (or beyond), congratulations! You’ve steeled yourself as a hunter, overcome the challenges of Low Rank, brought Zorah Magdaros’ quest to its conclusion and likely crafted yourself some rather swish gear on the way! High Rank brings with it a host of exciting new challenges as you encounter new monsters, new locales and the monsters you thought you knew from Low Rank will be even more dangerous, both hitting harder and being able to take more damage before they go down. But with these new challenges comes even more powerful rewards! High Rank monsters yield new parts and materials that you can use to craft even stronger armour pieces and weapons, so it’s probably a good idea to quickly transition over to the new gear on offer, or soon will be once you take down your first few monsters! The good news is, your first assignment in High Rank will help with just that… Finding those ??? Rathian tracks! Soon after arriving in High Rank you’ll be tasked with investigating some mysterious tracks that belong to an unidentified Rathian! Fear not though, there’s a couple of ways to approach this task that’ll have you filling up that progress bar in no-time and bringing you face to face with your elusive ??? Rathian! Method 1 – Finding ??? Rathian Footprints Whether you’re out on a High Rank expedition, or trying out some High Rank optional quests (denoted by the orange stars, instead of blue), there’s a good chance your scoutflies will discover ??? Rathian tracks when you’re adventuring in either the Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste or Coral Highlands – however you won’t find any in the Rotten Vale, maybe this type of Rathian isn’t a fan of the smell, after all that particular locale isn’t known for its fresh air! When you see these tracks, simply collect them and you’ll see your tracking progress bar increase! Growing the bar this way is incremental, but it’ll soon add up! You can speed up this process and make finding those tracks even easier by crafting the headpiece from the High Rank “Hunter’s α” set. This specific piece of armour has both the “Scoutfly Range Up” skill, which makes it easier to find traces, and the “Scholar” skill, which increases the total number of research points received – creating a great combo to keep your research rolling! The best bit is, this armour piece is really easy to craft, all you need is some zenny and a few pieces from the High Rank version of the small monster, Jagras: Jagras Hide x 3 Jagras Scale x 4 So just head out into a High Rank Expedition or Quest in the Ancient Forest, hunt down some Jagras and that armour will be yours before you know it! Method 2 – Completing High Rank, 6-Star Optional Quests Another way that will rapidly fill up your investigation bar is simply completing High Rank optional quests, which will provide you with a sizable chunk of progress, even if you don’t find any ??? Rathian tracks in the hunt itself! This also has the benefit of giving you the opportunity to farm out some of your first High Rank armour pieces and weapons to prepare you for what’s ahead! The available quests will let you choose from the following monsters to hunt: Barroth Pukei-Pukei Rathian And maybe a surprise guest…. If when you check the quest list, you can’t find a quest for any of the listed monsters, simply head out into a High Rank expedition, “spot” the monster up close and their quest will be added into the 6-star line-up. You can repeat the same quest multiple times too and still get investigation progress, so go for whichever one suits you best / which one will help you get the gear you’re after! To summarise, fear not this assignment! By simply doing some High Rank hunts and picking up tracks on the way, you’ll soon be coming face to face with ??? Rathian and a whole host of other monsters as you proceed with deeper into the New World and High Rank! Just make sure to swing by the Smithy to craft that High Rank gear, you’ll definitely appreciate it! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/388784334ed7611ea3a3bfff1054579b895b8a14.jpg Monster Hunter Stories returns this Summer!

582010,Return to World #6 – The Coral Highlands & Rotten Vale!,"Hey hunters, How’s the hunting going? Before we delve into this week’s post and delve into the two distinct, yet intertwined locales that are the Coral Highlands and Rotten Vale, we just wanted to say a big WELCOME to all the new (and returning) hunters who picked up Monster Hunter: World in the recent discount, it’s awesome to have you with us! If you’re looking for some early-game pointers to help you settle in whilst you get your hunting groove on, you can check out some of our earlier posts like hunting your first large monster, as well as some handy tips and tricks! For any more experienced hunters, feel free to share your personal top tips and advice in the comments too! The Coral Highlands & Rotten Vale! If you’re at the point where you’ve successfully hunted Anjanath in its dedicated Assigned Quest, you’ll soon be finding yourself in two new locales, each vastly different yet closely linked, the Coral Highlands and Rotten Vale! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/3d1e0b7b76cb540104f16fded016f85ae7fa0a69.jpg An early concept art of how the two areas are linked! We won’t go into too much detail on the monsters that roam these areas, as at this point you’re probably well settled into Low Rank and ready to face whatever comes your way! Just be prepared for even more monsters unlike anything you’ve faced so far, from their size and fighting behavior to the elements they wield and status effects they can inflict on you, these monsters will test what you’ve learned so far as you step ever closer to High Rank! The Coral Highlands The Coral Highlands, the third locale you’ll explore on your quest to track down Zorah Magdaros! This vibrant area can be found nestled high up among the clouds, giving home to a range of monsters that are perfected suited to thrive in this high-altitude environment! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/ae4c7af1484394e1023a56f9bbfce07f4574a6e6.jpg Keep a lookout for the friendly Wiggler endemic life that can be found in this area! Verticality is an apt description for this locale, so get ready to explore the crevices and peaks of the highlands. The monsters you’ll encounter here are well suited to take advantage of this terrain too, with many utilising flight and mobility to gain the upper hand on their prey. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/1862ea5e3342cf994430f9153f9183f09865bccd.jpg Paolumu make look cute, but it’s far from cuddly! Watch out for sudden attacks from the air! As you trek through the Coral Highlands, you may hear the shrill shrieking of the area’s Apex monster, Legiana, which can often be found in the highland’s upper reaches! When seeking out this monster, be ready for a frosty reception. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/9fae9e86f01ae41adb208c1bd28bf24aa30a7437.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/923e6fcf773071d5518abbacb583c5ff3488d8ce.jpg A glimpse at the highest reaches of Legiana’s domain. Talking of exploring the Coral Highlands, just a gentle reminder to make sure you’re gathering from any Bone Piles and Ore Nodes you see to start building up your stockpile of region-specific materials for your armour and weapon crafting needs! Now it’s time to delve deeper… The Rotten Vale After landing in the Coral Highlands, it won’t be long until you’re also delving into a realm of decay and malaise, The Rotten Vale. A stark contrast to the vibrance and teeming life of where you’ve just come from, this locale revolves around festering decomposition. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/6ead213f49fbc2130e2d8ea984a65b5c6abb2870.jpg Welcome to the Rotten Vale. As you descend deeper down the twisting paths of rock and bone in this locale, you’ll have to contend not only with the vicious monsters that inhabit this area, but the environment itself! Crystal clear pools of harmful acid and dark green clouds of Effluvium gas cover swathes of the area, causing varying degrees of damage over time, so watch your health when traversing and fighting in these areas. Helpful Tip: Wearing Mantles in areas where the Effluvium is gathering can stop the damage caused by the Effluvium. Alternatively, shooting Torch pod piles into the ground can create a safe area to fight or rest in without reducing your health. Just make sure to refresh them when they burn out! In addition, a Vitality Mantle can temporarily stop the damaging effects of the acid pool whilst it’s active. Also, since it’s not possible to fully stop the damaging effects of the acid pool without a Vitality Mantle, be careful to not run into the acid pool or worse, get knocked into it! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/96e1ef08f0bd3134965b4c624a143307bab7370b.jpg Watch your step! If you’re finding yourself spending extended amounts of time in the Effluvium or acid pools during your hunts in this area, both the Girros Coil and Hornetaur Mail armour pieces offer the “Effluvial Expert” armour skill, nullifying the damage over time you’d suffer from Effluvium effect and reducing the damage you take from acid whilst standing in it. Something to consider if you feel it’ll support ...",1707492792,

Our focus for this week’s post is on one particular monster, a monster that when World originally launched was seen by the community as the first wall to be surmounted, a true test of what you’d learned so far as a new hunter. It’s time to hunt Anjanath, the Fierce Jaw Wyvern and one of the tougher monsters you’ll face in low rank hunts! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/a3fad290288ab6256380bd0a5ba1eff707876efd.jpg If you’ve been following along with our Return to World community streams, you might have seen even our more experienced hunters carting a few times against this fiery foe! Just remember, there’s no shame in carting, we’ve all done it and still do! We hope today’s advice helps in your future hunts. Prevailing over Anjanath! Anjanath is a fire breathing menace introduced for the first time to the series in Monster Hunter: World. Upon taking on the quest “The Encroaching Anjanath” in the Ancient Forest, new hunters will find an aggressive, hard hitting, and agile monster unlike others faced up until that point. Although it can be tempting to focus entirely on hitting Anjanath’s large head, this isn’t always the best place to be for a hunter. Anjanath’s attacks tend to hit either in front of it or behind it, leaving its sides where only its legs and tiny arms are, exposed much of the time. By frequently weakening its legs you can eventually topple this threatening terror, leaving its head primed for big damage dealing attacks. Be warned that being to Anjanath’s side doesn’t mean you’re completely safe, as it can still quickly bash into you with its hips. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/7519db393a844aaab0c5bf8ba8d5e5cf080d20a0.jpg Anjanath has another phase when it becomes enraged, which you can quickly tell as its membrane from waist to tail extends out like a fan, creating an imposing visage along with its pronounced nose bone, indicating that it has become agitated and will now strike with highly dangerous close and ranged fire attacks. Stay on the move, get ready to roll and do your best to see when it rears its head back for a powerful breath attack. At this stage of the game and without armor with fire resistance, these attacks can quickly combo you back to camp on a cart! If you’re looking to craft a weapon to get the upper hand on Anjanath, note that it’s weakest to the Water element. You might be able to craft Jyuratodus weapons already since you’ll have just hunted it at this point. Some armor, such as the Bone set, have resistance to fire, while the Kulu headpiece grants you the one level of the Fire Resistance skill to help withstand those breath attacks. Gearing up early is not an essential part of hunting Anjanath, but it does allow more breathing room while you’re still getting familiar with the monster. Keep an eye on the total defence of your armor too, it might be worth using some of the Armor Spheres you’ve collected so far to give your chosen armor pieces a boost at the Smithy! Oh, and if you are carting, don’t forget to eat another meal again at one of the Ancient Forest’s camps when you can to regain extra maximum health, stamina and other benefits! At the end of the day, take each experience as a lesson and you’ll find yourself getting better with each hunt. Anjanath can be a tough wall but incredibly rewarding hunt for new hunters, but the satisfaction of overcoming that hurdle is all part of becoming a hunter. Quest Complete – We’ll See you next time!

582010,Return to World #4 – A Walk on the Wildspire Side!,"Hey hunters, Happy New Year! It’s been great seeing “Return to World” take flight and seeing both the fresh perspectives from new players, and the fond memories from everyone coming back or rolling a new hunter. In our update this week, we’ll walk you through the second main location in Monster Hunter: World, as well as a few of the exciting monsters you’ll be facing down for the first time. We’ll also round up a few other updates from the world of Monster Hunter. First up, our journey in Monster Hunter: World continues! Hunting Locations – Wildspire Waste {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/53fdf9281268b13a270db383525ff07c085a9030.jpg The Wildspire Waste is the second locale in Monster Hunter: World’s early quests. As the name implies, the wastes are a combination of parched desert land and swamplands due to water flowing from the nearby Ancient Forest. Hunters will start at the southwest camp as their starting camp, however there are three others in the locale that can be discovered and unlocked later. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/c5e9768287896a23b270b663e4b94b16ab145747.jpg The Wildspire Waste has multiple areas where you can take the high ground on monsters by leaping from elevated rocks. On the flip side, some areas with flowing water can hamper your movement and keep you from evading a powerful attack at just the right time. Be aware of your positioning and the elements around you at all times. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/181f16428855e1a56d1afe3ae17df338e1ceddeb.jpg In the locale’s most northeast area you’ll need to deal with desert hills with rolling hills of sand resulting in unstable footing. This means plenty of chances to slide down those slopes and unleashing unique sliding attacks that can only be done during this state. This area also contains a natural trap in the form of quicksand! If the mighty Diablos is lurking in the area underneath the sand, it can be attracted through noise to come charging through the soft ground of the natural trap, causing monsters and hunters alike to fall into the caves below in epic fashion. More Monsters – Besting a Barroth Upon your arrival in Wildspire Wastes you’ll quickly come into a fresh range of Monsters that present wholly new challenges to what you’ve encountered so far in the Ancient Forest. Many of the Monsters here use their size and power to attack with brute force, using their physical mass and their mastery of the local terrain to attack and repel any hunters that dare provoke their ire. The first Monster you’ll be tasked to hunt in Wildspire Waste is Barroth, who introduces some new mechanics to further test your growing skills. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/622e7f4cf3cf82eb019321899f5921355644ad20.jpg Hunt Preparation A new locale means new challenges. If you’re finding you’re taking some bigger hits than you’d expect from the new Monsters you’re facing, consider visit the Smithy and spend some zenny and armor spheres to increase your armour set’s defence. Many of the Monsters in this region can hit for high amounts of physical damage, so Mega Potions are incredibly handy to quickly heal. You may have also foraged some Adamant Seeds during your time in the Ancient Forest. Consuming one of these will give you a temporary boost to your defence! Trust us, they’re much more useful in your hunter than the storage box! All that’s left is to eat a meal to boost your health and stamina, then you’re ready to meet Barroth. Know Your Monster Barroth is a Brute Wyvern characterised by a prominent, ridged crest on its head. It primarily attacks by using its head (literally), tail and tackling the hunter up close. Now a little earlier we mentioned that the Monsters that inhabit Wildspire Waste introduce new challenges, well Barroth is particularly hard-headed. This means that bladed weapons below blue sharpness will bounce off, doing reduced damage, increasing sharpness loss and making you recoil slightly. However, blunt damage weapons like the Hammer and its charged attacks, or playing self-enforcement with a Hunting Horn before striking, are ideal for this situation because these types of attacks can help in breaking the head’s crest without the strikes being bounced! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/05941941e047a9421a051efd92a52ce104a97f53.jpg If you are using a bladed or ranged weapon, fear not, Barroth’s weak points are its forearms and severable tail! Target those areas and you’ll be just fine once you get through the mud. Yes, the mud. Barroth loves to cover itself in mud, giving those areas extra production until the now hardened mud has been removed by your attacks. Listen for the whistle! Barroth’s strongest attack is its charge attack, which can catch unprepared or distracted hunters off-guard, dealing a massive blow. The good news? This attack will only occur in a straight line and there’s some tells when it’s going to occur! 1. Barroth will tilt its head to the ground and brace itself. 2. It’ll let off loud, steam-like whistle. 3. CHAAARGE! If you see this attac...",1704893897,

582010,"Return to World #3 – Tips & Tricks Grab Bag, Volume 1","Hey hunters, In lieu of our game walkthroughs, this week’s installment of the Return to World community blogs features some of our top tips and tricks essential to a successful hunt in Monster Hunter: World. These core tips will prove useful even as you venture beyond the early game and start taking on tougher challenges. The More You Know! Dung Pods Let’s talk dung. After a monster has done its business, it’ll leave dung in certain areas on the map. Now you may be wondering, why would I ever want to pick that up? Dung allows you to create dung pods, which are essential for getting monsters away from you. This is perfect when you’re hunting one monster and end up getting interrupted by another that you’re not interested in hunting. Keep yourself from being in the middle of a Turf War and deploy a well-placed Dung Pod to stay focused on your prey! Mini-map Monster Status Aside from observing the monster’s behavior, you can get a sense of their state based on their eye icon in the mini-map. When the monster icon is yellow, it may be in combat but not targeting your directly. When the icon is red, the monster is targeting you and will be exhibiting more aggressive behavior, making it difficult to mount. When the icon is flashing red, the monster is enraged and cannot be mounted without taking damage. It will also deal out extra damage. Lastly, the skull icon next to the monster means it has low health and can be captured. More on that in the next section… Capturing Monsters If you’re seeing the skull icon on the monster’s icon in the mini-map, it’s ready to be captured. To capture a monster, you’ll want to deploy either a Shock Trap or Pitfall Trap and lure it to just the right spot. Once it’s caught in the trap, get close to the monster, and throw down two Tranq Bombs in quick succession. The monster will be captured, and the quest will be completed! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/6d8da66d629a087080484cbf00de09e2933cdf9f.jpg Keep in mind that if you’re playing multi-player, it might be helpful to ask your hunting party if they would like to slay or capture the monster, since they can offer different rewards based on your chosen method. There are also some quests later on that specify only to slay or capture the monster, so make sure you double check the quest details to avoid heartbreak. Item Loadouts Creating good habits with your items and loadouts at the start of your hunting journey will pay off in the long run. Every hunter will have their own personal item loadout that works best for them. Starting off with essentials like Potions, Mega Potions and Max Potions will ensure you always have enough healing to get out of a sticky situation. We recommend taking some of the items we listed in the tips above, like Dung Pods and traps for capturing monsters. Additionally, Large Barrel Bombs are perfect for dealing big damage when the monster is asleep. Flash pods are another great item that blinds an enemy, which can help create key openings for attacks, or interrupt them from unleashing a deadly strike. Once you’ve got all your items set, head to the Item Box, select Manage Items, Item Loadouts, and register your loadout. You can have up to 80 Item Loadouts, which should be more than you’ll ever need saved at one time. Radial Menu Your Radial Menu can also be saved separately from your Item Loadout. Setting up your menu just right helps you build muscle memory to quickly select the right item in your time of need. We recommend having your most frequently used items such as potions and rations on your first menu, and using the other menus for helpful, but less used items such as buffs and capture tools. Don’t forget, by using your Whetstone from the Radial Menu, you can sharpen your weapon without needing to sheathe it. Every second counts! SOS Flares Don’t ever be afraid to fire an SOS Flare if you need some help on a quest! These allow other players to join your quest and help with a hunt. You can find it in your Start Menu under the “Quest” category. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/1caa7ad3b0d095061c81b02878bb90039d0937ae.jpg Keep in mind that you can’t always send out an SOS, especially if it’s your first time discovering a certain monster. The game will clearly communicate when you can and can’t send one out. Claim your Add-Ons! Even if you’re brand new to Monster Hunter: World, plenty of free add-ons featuring helpful items and other bonuses are available to redeem. Head to Your Room and speak to the Housekeeper to claim all of your bonuses! That’s all our tips for now, but we’ll be back with more in the future! Quest Complete – We’ll See you next time!

Before we get into that though, just a quick reminder that Steam’s The Game Awards sale ends on December 21st, meaning you only have a couple of days from the time of this post to get World at its lowest ever price on Steam! https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World/ Now with that out of the way, it’s time to set out into the Ancient Forest… Hunting Locations – The Ancient Forest Welcome to the Ancient Forest, a lush, greenery filled area that’s as dense as it is tall and brimming with life – from endemic creatures and small monsters, like the Jagras, to a variety of powerful large monsters that lurk in the undergrowth and treetop canopies under the watchful gaze of the King of the Skies… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/31060d18cfd20e49edb86a8f5e392ca275ff0509.jpg Heading out from camp! Stepping out from your camp, you’ll emerge onto the Ancient Forest’s shoreline, giving you the options to travel further along down the coast, head into the surrounding forest or even start your approach to the huge tree that dwarfs the surrounding area. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/99ed479d0daf332051ce7ea5194050a9574a99ad.jpg Talking of exploring and gathering items, it’s definitely worth grabbing anything you come by, but keep a special lookout for: Herbs – To craft Potions that heal you! Honey – Combine with Potions to make Mega Potions, offering much greater healing! Bone Piles – To aid in crafting and upgrading your gear! Mining Outcrops – To also aid in crafting and upgrading your gear! Of course, there’s even more for you to forage and find out there, and if you find your bag full, you can always return to camp to deposit your items for later use. Talking of your camp, you’re not limited to just the one! The Ancient Forest has four total camps you can make use of, including your starting one. In order to use the other three, first you’ll need to find the suitable spaces and then rebuild them. That’s where your exploration comes in! The verticality of this region hides many secrets, both above and below you – look out for hidden pathways to crawl through on the ground, as well as potential hideaways up in the branches! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/16c2e7fe6fa0c29ae4c3f5ffbef1b0e5854b425d.jpg Once you’ve found one of these spaces, you’ll get a notification that a camp can be built. Then you’ll want to head back to Astera and select “Complete Deliveries” at the Resource Center, giving you the option to trade materials for a new, permanent camp to be built. (Which requires resources from the area, so if you’ve been stocking up as you’ve been exploring you’ll probably be able to complete the request immediately!) Once built, you’ll have a new spawn location you can use when starting a quest in the Ancient Forest, or fast travel to when you’re already there, helping you quickly move through the area! You’ll be visiting and returning to the Ancient Forest frequently during your questing through the New World, so investing some time unlocking these camps will pay off in the long run, but there’s no pressure, discover them at your own pace! Your First Large Monster – Great Jagras {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33171098/805e46e438ce69a03e214e093c04f4591c516612.jpg You’ve been gathering materials, taking down small monsters and settling into the Ancient Forest, but now the time has come for your first major test as a hunter, to hunt Great Jagras! Now returning and more experienced hunters will be very familiar with Great Jagras and its pack already, so feel free to share your tips for new hunters in the comments section! For those of you that are new to Monster Hunter, or still tackling this Urgent Quest, here’s a few suggestions of our own too help you slay your target! Hunt Preparation Equipment Your starting leather armour may fit nicely, but it won’t provide much protection from damage! Visit Astera’s Smithy and consider forging yourself some Bone Armor, and possibly even upgrade your weapon, for example, upgrading the Hunter’s Knife Sword and Shield to level two only takes two iron ores! Increasing your defensive and offensive stats will make a big difference, and if you’ve been seeking out both Mining Outcrops and Bone Piles in the Ancient Forest, you should have enough materials to cover your needs here! With over fourteen different weapon types to choose from, don’t be shy on trying out a range of different weapons! You never know when you’ll find your new favourite! Items Despite how nimble you feel, there’s a good chance that you’ll be taking some knocks from Great Jagras, so stocking up on healing items will be a big help! If you’ve been collecting honey, you’ll be able to cr...",1702903205,

582010,Lies of P is an upcoming Dark Souls-like game starring Pinocchio,"Neowiz and Round8 Studio announced a new game based on the classic children’s story character Pinocchio. <strong>Lies of P</strong> takes place in a twisted version of the Pinocchio world where automatons have overrun the fictional city of Krat. Pinocchio must find Mr. Geppetto to reverse the city’s ill fortunes and overcome the killer puppets to save Krat from the ruin in finds itself in. The accompanying trailer showcases the gameplay and atmosphere of Lies of P, which is extremely Dark Souls in nature and substance. The city itself feels like Yharnam from Bloodborne, and Pinocchio himself uses a variety of weapons to take on different flavors of automaton enemy. Pinocchio also uses what looks like magic while exploring the dark streets of Krat and uses a mechanical arm to equip different skills. More intriguing is the claim that the game will feature &ldquo;profound narrative choices&rdquo;, which could be interesting if they extend past what ending you get. And the game is being billed as an RPG, so hopefully we see some wildly diverging builds in how you can build up Pinocchio. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/lies-of-p-dark-souls-pinocchio"">Read more</a> ",1636749872,

In a rare exception to the general rule that games get delayed, that's earlier than we were expecting - publisher Capcom had previously planned to launch in autumn. That said, it came out on consoles in January, so. Capcom has also confirmed the minimum and recommend system requirements for what has already become the best-selling game in its history, with over eight million units shipped to consoles worldwide. At a minimum, you'll need a GeForce GTX 760 or AMD Radeon R7 260x with 2GB VRAM or more; an Intel i5-4460 at 3.20 GHz or an AMD FX-6300 (or better); 8 GB of RAM; 20 GB of storage; DirectX version 11; and Windows 7 or above (64-bit required). This will deliver 30fps at 1080p on low graphics settings. Mouse, keyboard, and game pads (both DirectInput and XInput) are supported. Recommended specs suggest a GTX 1060 (VRAM 3GB) or Radeon RX 570X (VRAM 4GB); an Intel i3 8350 at 4GHz, or an Intel i7 3770 at 3.4GHz, or an AMD Ryzen 5 - all other requirements, including RAM, are the same as the minimum spec.

Anderson has issued an apology, as has Asian-American actor Jin Au-Yeung, who performed the line in the film. The scene will be removed from all versions of the film worldwide. ""I am absolutely devastated that a line from our movie, Monster Hunter, has offended some audience members in China"" Anderson says in a statement provided to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2020/12/monster-hunter-paul-w-s-anderson-mc-jin-milla-jovovich-apologize-china-controversy-1234652024/"">Deadline</a>. ""I apologize for any anxiety or upset that this line and its interpretation caused. Monster Hunter was made as fun entertainment and I am mortified that anything within it has caused unintentional offense. We have respectfully removed the line from the movie. It was never our intention to send a message of discrimination or disrespect to anyone. To the contrary - at its heart our movie is about unity.""

In the scene, one character asks another ""What kind of knees are these?"" following up with ""Chi-knees."" The pair are American soldiers, as the protagonists are a team of military recruits that get transported to the world of the games. As Ahmad explains, this joke has racial connotations due to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese,_Japanese,_dirty_knees"">playground chant used to disparage people of Asian heritage in English-speaking countries</a>. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-world/steam-review"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-world/doom-eternal-crossover-mod"">This Monster Hunter mod lets you fight Doom Eternal's Marauder alongside Isabelle from Animal Crossing</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-world/monster-hunter-crossover-event"">Play as Milla Jovovich in the event quests coming to Monster Hunter World</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-world/movie-release-date"">Everyone relax, the Monster Hunter movie is coming to save Christmas</a> ",1607182766,
