308600,HARDER COPS & KILL STREAKS,"Hey all! Mostly a small balance patch. The most important things are cops are quite a bit harder now. And killing enemies is more rewarding. You get 2x as much XP per player kill, and also there's a new kill streak shown under the health bar. You get more cash per kill in the streak $100, then $200, then $300, up to a 10x streak of $1000 per kill. Stay alive! Also, big thanks to everyone who's particpated in the survey so far! It's super useful. Especially to hear what the quiet majority of players enjoy or not. I'm posting screenshots of the results in discord if you're curious what others have voted for. Have fun! bencelot ---- Holding the space bar when opening flasks in a queue will pause the timer, letting you see what you got Added a cool new victory screen cosmetic for the Legendary pack, and a visual in the flask animation page that shows how it affects your rarities At wanted level 5, a helicopter now shows up to shoot missiles at you Cops are now more accurate and are more aggressive Normal cops now have 50 instead of 40 health, and special forces have 100 instead of 50 health The time between wanted level 1 and wanted level 2 is 50% (aka you hit wanted 2 much sooner) XP fills slightly slower in XP Pools, because.. Killing enemy players now gives 100xp instead of 50xp The kill streak mechanic is now shown below you health bar. It now goes up to 10x isntead of 5x. The cash you get from a kill is $100 x killstreak (so the first one gives $100, then $200, up to a max of $1,000) Health Stimulant chemical now restores +20 hp/s instead of +10 hp/s Supply Beacon chemical now can carry 2 charges instead of 1 XRay Vision can now reveal enemy invisible targets Bouncing Bullet's mutation seeking is reduced a bit, and the skill does slightly less damage Invis has a 1.0s low damage penalty instead of 0.5s Blade Fury has reduced slashing damage Phase Drifting does a bit less damage at max speed Assassinate gives slightly more farm per kill Skill Shots gets slightly more move speed from the mutation per charge Criminal's gang now gets 2 instead of 3 followers (to compensate for the cops being stronger) Criminal has a 3% instead of 2% chance to spawn a gangster Assassin gains +10% upgrade power per kill instead of +15% Assault now gets +20% bullet speed instead of +30%",1763724750,['patchnotes']
308600,BALANCE UPDATE,"Hey all! Just a bit of a balance patch this version. I've been working on marketing this last month, getting more players to download the game via youtube and tiktok videos. This is long overdue, but working well so far. Already got +50% more downloads per day than last month. I'll keep doing this for a while longer then add more big content patches after that. Have fun! bencelot ---- - F2P players can now complete the final 60 challenges in each grid (but still need the DLC to claim them). The final wave of heart drops (that land at -2:00) have 2 crates instead of 1. So you don't have to run so far across the map There is a 20s instead of 10s delay between finishing a mission and seeing the next arrow Gangster's have a shorter shooting range Overtime circle is a bit bigger to reduce density Car explosions are bigger and cars launch further Medkits now heal +30 instead of +40 health Assault's medkits now heal 50 health (other classes get 30) Assault's weapons have +50% instead of +100% reload speed Heavy's shield charges faster and more efficiently in XP Pools Heavy gains +3% ROF per level regardless of health (it's no longer +1% above 50% health) Caster's active skills heal by +30 instead of +20 hp on cast Caster's vendor upgrades are -33% for weapons (same as before), but now -50% for skill upgrades. Scavenger's healing rate is +150% instead of +100% when standing still Scavenger's shift recharge rate is +150% instead of +100% when standing still Criminal's cops kills only restore +20 instead of +30 health Scientist's explosive bombs are now 75% instead of 50% likely to show in the shop Frenzy cooldown is now 2s faster Firestorm has higher blast jumping power to push you up against walls Stimpacks and Blade Mail are indirectly nerfed due to medkits only giving +30 health Gunslinger's mutation gives 2/4/6/8 instead of 1/2/3/4 extra grenade carry capacity Falling Inferno's mutation gives +4/8/12/16 molotov duration instead of +3/6/9/12s Shrapnel's damage is now +50% higher Charged Shot has a larger hitbox on the charged bullet Phase Drifting is a tad faster, but has a ministun when you hit a wall Combo Killer's infinite shift duration is now 3/6/9/12 instead of 2/4/6/8s Invisiblity low damage penalty is 1.0s instead of 0.5s, but cooldown is 2s faster Beefcake mutation now gives +3/6/9/12 instead of +2/4/6/8 max hp per purchase",1762169208,['patchnotes']
308600,SMALL TWEAKS,"Hey all, just small miscellaneous changes this version. Have fun! bencelot ---- - Players who hadn't caught up to their true xp level have now been instantly granted all that XP. The whole ""earn XP 5x faster while catching up"" grind is removed. - Rare DNA Flasks now cost 500 instead of 750 acid. - The top rank in the game is now called ""Skill Slayer"" instead of ""Genetic God"", and the ""Super Soldier"" rank is now called ""Predator"" - Sniper class is now called Striker - Hovering over the class in the leaderboards now shows class info - If anyone in the server reaches max wanted level, all civilians will appear in a red shirt and deal extra damage - Gangsters can now appear in non-BR game modes - The explosive gangster always carries a minigun - Mission civs and vendors now spawn immediately at the start of the round, not one every second, causing the arrow to flicker back and forth - Cars have a slower base max speed, but a higher boost multiplier (same speed while boosting, but easier to steer without boosting) - In survival mode, you start with at least wanted level 1, 2, 3, 4 based on the round number - Survival mode is harder when playing coop - more zombies spawn at the end of survival rounds - Zombies spawn in the middle of survival rounds, including in standard difficulty",1760181136,['patchnotes']
308600,Making Max Level Skills Meaningful!,"Hey all, this version makes max level skills more fun. In the old version, it didn't feel that interesting to take a skill from level 6 to 7, or 7 to 8. You barely felt the difference as the increase was so small. And the game often ended before you could even reach that high. That's a wasted opportunity, because working towards and achieving a max level skill should be a fun thing to do! To fix this, skills now max out at level 7 instead of 8, which means you can actually reach them before the game ends. And to compensate and make it exciting, the last 2 skill levels now have values that jump up 2x as much. So it's now worth it to choose a skill to focus on, as the core of your build, and try max it out ASAP to take advantage of those final levels. Have fun! bencelot ---- - Slightly more max health kits drop into the map (to account for the power boost above and minimise burst damage skills) - Photon Beam now works better for blasting with Scientist's bullets - Skills go back to max 7 levels, instead of 8 - Skills now have a 2/3/4/5/6/8/10 pattern instead of a 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 pattern - Boots of travel is a bit slower, and no longer works with the Speed vendor upgrade. The mutation jump height is increased. - Force Field mutation does a bit less damage - Bullet Time's cooldown is 2s slower, and it doesn't slow enemy bullets quite as much as before - Blade Fury's cooldown is 2s slower, and the slashing size of the mutation is smaller - Firestorm's cooldown is 2s slower - Shockwave's cooldown is 2s slower - Frenzy no longer works with the speed vendor upgrade - Phase Drifting's cooldown is now 2s slower, and it no longer works with the Speed vendor upgrade - Charged Shot now only gains 50% damage and healing from Cluster Bomb - Charged Shot's mutation healing is now 15/30/45/60 instead of 20/40/60/80 - Energy Vortex cooldown is now 2s slower - Rambulance armor and healing values are a bit stronger ",1759503139,['patchnotes']
308600,RISKY REWARDS,"Hey all, small tweaks this version around the ideas of RISK & REWARD. There are things you can do in this game which are risky. Like fighting gangsters. You risk dying, and you also risk wasting your time, but there's a nice reward if you pull it off. This version aims to add a few more mechanics like this! Cops do more damage, vendors are now harder to kill but always drop Double Damage loot, gangsters camps will now sometimes drop a tier 2 gun, and Kill Frenzy missions now reward you with 30s of Frenzy if you complete it! Have fun! bencelot ---- - Vendors now always drop a double damage drop when killed, but they deal more damage - The ""Damage Drops"" modifier is changed to make double damage last 4s longer - Cops now deal +50% more damage - Capturing gangster loot now has a chance to drop a bonus crate containing a tier 2 weapon - Completing a KILL FRENZY mission now also gives you 30 seconds of Frenzy at +50% ROF - Molotovs now deal 30 instead of 20 impact damage - Assassinate gives a bit more cash and XP - Charged Shot now does more damage after throwing a grenade, the same amount as casting a skill - Mirror Image clones have slightly more health - Combo Killer drops slightly more loot - Illicit Income's mutation gives slightly more ROF per wanted level - Phase Drifting accelerates to top speed a bit faster - Teleportation's cooldowns are a bit faster - Manic Mechanic's murations gives slightly more ROF (50 instead of 40%) - Flying Dagger goes back to a simple form of damage, no longer doing the above/below 50% thing. Ranging from 100% to 135% damage - Armed Robbery no longer drops extra damage from vendors, but has a cooldown time of 40s instead of 60s",1758709789,['patchnotes']
308600,SYRINGES NOW COME FROM OVERTIME,"Hey all, this version has a simple but important change: - We now get +1 syringe per round when overtime begins (0:00), instead of every 10 score. The reasons for this are: - New players and vets are more balanced. Before, newbies sometimes only got 2 syringes, and vets sometimes knew how to earn 4 or even 5. Now we'll all have 3, making the game less snowbally and giving more balanced fights. - 3 mutations is a more fun amount. When veterans got 4 or 5 syringes per match, the decision making was lost. You were merely deciding the ORDER you unlocked your mutations. Now, with only 3, you have to really CHOOSE which skills you want to mutate. - Less veteran advantage. If vets only get 3 mutations instead of 4, then having a bunch of legendaries makes them less powerful. More fair for new players. - Less confusing. Score is a complex system for new players to understand. Mutations are a core part of the game and shouldn't depend on a complex system. Now you earn them in a very straightforward way. - Fun pacing milestone when overtime begins, and even pacing of unlocks across all 3 rounds. Have fun! bencelot ---- - We now get +1 syringe per round when overtime begins (0:00), instead of every 10 score. - The winner of each round gets +1000xp - The build skills now appear at levels 4 and 5, instead of 5 and 6 - The camera is zoomed out more to give more strategic vision of the map - Blast cannon has a bit of a bigger explosion radius - Made it easier to dodge bazookas when shifting - Modifier level ups now give 5 shards instead of 50 acid - The DLC now also boosts class level ups, going from 100 to 300 acid (shards stay at 50) - Fixed a bug with Marksman challenge",1758527742,['patchnotes']
308600,Polishing Points,"Just some QoL and bug fixing this week! Joining in R1 will give you 100% of average xp, not 80% Fixed a bug with the wrong synergy challenge getting completed Improved the loading time when hoping into a new map Made the options menu save settings more reliably Classes unlock a bit slower, every 10th instead of 5th level. This prevents early DNA flasks being too diluted across all 8 classes, and lets new players get more drops on simple ones like Assault. Added more play flasks to the start of the progresssion system to give noobs more control and choice. Left clicking while random class mode is enabled will no longer affect the random class selction. It's right click only as the description says Every skill's description now has an extra line that describes how the mutation works (shown in the main menu, not in-game) Items in the rotationg show can now go up to 3x value (instead of 2x value). Generally things that cost 800u or more are 3x value, and 400 to 800 range are 2.5x value. Your mute list is now saved between play sessions (type /mute bencelot to mute someone. Type /unmute bencelot to unmute). ",1757349120,['patchnotes']
308600,Synergy Challenges!,"SYNERGY CHALLENGESThis version adds a bunch of new challenges that not only test your player skills, but also teaches you how to use the skills in the game too! Each challenge has the following format: 1) You must play a specific class 2) You must use a specific skill (specially chosen to combo with that class) 3) You must win at least 9 trophies in the match (basically come 1st or 2nd) If you win while using the required class/skill combo you'll complete the challenge and see numbers go up. You can also claim the reward, which is either ACID, Magnets, or the premium currency Uranium.JUICY REWARDS (48 daily challenges worth of ACID)There are 24 challenges available for free, and 80 if you have the Deluxe DLC. But even for free to play players, these rewards are quite nice. It will take a long time to win all of these challenges so I wanted the grind to be worth it. Just in the 24 free challenges you can claim: +400 uranium +4 magnets +2400 acidYou can convert that 400 uranium into 12,000 acid, or 14400 acid total, which is what you'd get from completing 48 daily challenges (or 10 full days of grinding the 5 dailys per day). Hopefully this is a good incentive for people to grind these challenges, because...THE REAL REWARDS ARE THE LESSONS YOU LEARN ALONG THE WAYI mostly added this system to teach new players some of the many synergies in Skillshot City. This is a complex game and it's a bit overwhelming for a new player. Where to start? How to make a good build? What should I equip? These challenges now provide a guide. Each challenge has been chosen to require you to win with a strong synergy, and also has a useful tip explaining how to use it. You can read through these challenges, even the ones in the DLC section, and get ideas on how to improve your builds. Look for your favorite class and see what skills are suggested to combo with it, and then read the tip for how to pull off the combo.The challenge grid starts with some basic and obvious synergies, but also includes more advanced ones too. There are even challenges which require 2 skills instead of a class and a skill. Some examples:Self Repair (skill) + Mirror Image (skills) TIP: Cast Self Repair first, then immediately cast Mirror Image after. Your clone will spawn with Self Repair activated, allowing you to get double healing. Sniper (class) + Shrapnel (skill): TIP: Sniper throws an extra grenade, and Shrapnel makes grenades deal extra damage.Scavenger (class) + Medical Supplies (skills): TIP: Scavenger drops a bunch of loot once you collect 50 pieces of it. Medical Supplies heals your for each bit of loot you pick up, making your nearly invulnernable when the 50 bits of loot drop out of you.Assault (class) + Hypnotic Army (skill) TIP: Hypnotic Army lets you bring civs into a fight with you. When they die Assault's perk makes each one of them drop a free health kit. OTHER RECENT CHANGESI've made a few hotfixes to the game over the last month. I've updated the in-game changelog feature but not offically posted about them here on Steam. Here are some of the bigger changes if you haven't played in the last few weeks: \All players have been given a starter flask for each class that gives 4 rares, 2 epics and 1 legendary skill that was specifically chosen to synergize with that class (and indeed appears in this new synergy challenge grid).Added QoL features like a ""CLAIM ALL"" button on modifiers level ups, and made the flask opening animation instant (unless you're about to get a legendary).Fixed various bugs and crashes for Chinese peeps.If you join a game mid-match, the auto skill picker will now try prioritize skills you like, instead of pure random.Clicking JOIN GAME on someone's name via the friends page will try to put you into their squad, instead of merely just joining their server.Servers that have lots of high level players in them now give out slightly more trophies at the end of the matchRandom skills mode now lets you equip the top 2 slots of your build. The bottom 6 slots are still randomized. So you still have SOME control over your build, but not as much as constructed mode.Added 20 new gun skins. Rainbow gun skins! These are added after the silver and golden ones, ranging from 105 to 200 combined class levels. Basically you can adjust the colour of the gun and the glow with a slider.Streamlined magnets. They now give exactly 500 DNA every time, and never hit rarities. The exception for this is Magnetic Flask, which always hits rarities. This works out to slightly more DNA given per magnet on average, and is far more reliable.Warmup round is now throwing knives only!The free login bonus in the shop now gives 2x more acidThere are now 5 instead of 4 free daily challenges. And each one gives 300 instead of 250 acid (900 instead of 750 for DLC).The 6th bonus daily challenge now gives 3x values instead of 2x value. 3,000 acid for 100 uranium, instead of 4,000 for 200.We can now spend our syringes directly and instantly on any skill you want ...",1756904150,
308600,BUYING MUTATIONS IN THE DRAFT,"Hey all, pretty spicy change here: - We can now INSTANTLY spend our syringes as soon as we earn them, simply by holding ALT and clicking the button in the skill draft. You no longer need to shop around at vendors. Note, I put out a patch yesterday which was a bit broken. This version fixes it. I'm reposting yesterday's changelog here, with a few tweaks. Have fun!bencelot ---- \Vendors no longer sell mutations. Instead we spend our syringes in the skill draft.Mutating now always costs 1 syringe instead of 1/2/2/2/2.Instead of getting 1 syringe on score 5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50/55/etc you get 1 syringe at score 10/20/30/40/50/60/etc.A new indicator is shown next to your syringes up the top right saying ""Next Syringe: X/20 Score""Syringe Supply modifier now drops 1 instead of 2 syringes. Drug Stash modifier has a 20% instead of 50% chance of syringes.Slowed down the levelling curve. 7500xp now reaches level 10 instead of level 12.Level 10 is now when scoring stops, not level 12. This makes for cleaner maths.We now get +3 score per level instead of +2, capped at 30 (enough for your 3rd syringe mutation).Level 10 is now when you get your 5th skill, not level 12. Cleaner milestone.In constructed build mode (not using random skills), the 3rd skill slot no longer appears when you hit levels 5 and 6.Instead, you can reroll on these levels so you can see another skill from your build. This costs money, but is instant.Rerolling on levels 5 and 6 now costs $3000 instead of $1000 (it's still $1000 if you do random class mode).\There are now 5 instead of 4 free daily challenges. And each one gives 300 instead of 250 acid (900 instead of 750 for DLC).The 6th bonus daily challenge now gives 3x values instead of 2x value. 3,000 acid for 100 uranium, instead of 4,000 for 200.Weekly challenges now require 4/8/12/16/20 dailys to complete instead of 3/6/9/12/15 (as we have 1 extra per day)\Heart crates once again fall every 30s instead of every 60sHeart crates stop landing after -2:00 into overtimeFixed a bug with heart crates not being destroyed on the clientRandom Class modes gives 5% less cash and XP for all amountsRemoved the infinitely explorable overtime thing in survival mode between roundsVendor upgrade costs now scaled based on the total amount purchased: 6/9/15/18/21/24/27/30k/etc\Caster's skill upgrades are now -33% instead of -50% the cost, but apply to all upgrades, not just skill-ones",1753884522,['patchnotes']
308600,SAVE YOUR SHIELDS,"Hey all, small patch this week. The biggest change is this: Zombies no longer lose their max shield when they revive. This makes kills earned as a zombie matter far more now, because when you kill enemies and they drop shield drops, you get to keep them after reviving. You now only lose shield when you die, not when you revive. Have fun! bencelot ---- Max shield is now 60% instead of 40% (3 kills instead of 2) Zombies no longer lose their collected max shield when they revive When zombies revive, they respawn with exactly 50% health and shield The heart drops during overtime now land at -0:30, -1:30, -2:30, -3:30 Players move 5% faster Skill Healing vendor upgrades now give +10/20/30% instead of +15/30/45% Skill duration/size/speed vendor upgrades now give +15/30/45% instead of +20/40/60% Chemicals now cost $8000 instead of $6000 Added a new chemical called Supply Beacon. Supply beacon lets you summon a supply drop to your location with a 30s timer. The passive gives you +20% cash from loot on the ground Beefcake's mutation now gives +2/4/6/8 isntead of +3/6/9/12 max hp per upgrade purchased. Raw max hp ranges from 16 to 72 instead of 20 to 90 max hp. Manic Mechanic's mutation now gives +40% instead of +50% rate of fire Automatic Armor cooldown now ranges from 15s to 8s (instead of fixed at 10s). Duration is 1.5 instead of 2.0s. Revenge Rockets now fire back at gangsters and cops. The mutation gives 40/80/120/160% new rockets instead of 25/50/75/100% Rambulance healing now ranges from 3 to 13.5 instead of 4 to 18 hp/s Proximity Rounds trigger range vs gangsters reduced to 35/70/105/140 instead of 50/100/150/200m Regeneration healing begins 1.5s after combat instead of 1s. Boots of Travel speed begins after 1.5s instead of 1.0s. Move speed is now +16% to +72% instead of +14% to +63% Stimpacks healing now ranges from 3 to 10 instead of 3 to 13.5. Stimpacks mutation health kit chance ranges from 8 to 32% isntead of 7 to 28% Mana Shield duration is now 2s instead of 2.5s after casting a skill Charged Shot mutation healing is now 20/40/60/80 instead of 15/30/45/60 Energy Vortex cooldown is now 2s faster Hypnotic Army cooldown is now 2s faster, and max followers is +1 larger Assassinate no longer prioritizes players with higher bounties, allowing it to instead focus on closer enemies",1753701132,['patchnotes']
308600,MINOR BALANCING,"Hey all, a fairly small patch today but with some interesting changes from observing new people play: 1) Heavy class no longer drops health kits, but instead can recharge its shield to 100% in XP Pools. This makes it actually act like a heavy tanky boi, instead of more of an ""agility"" character where you need to grab the kits. Easier for new players to understand, and interesting mechanics of holding space near XP Pools. 2) In squads mode, players missions are now shared with allies. Have fun! bencelot ---- - Civilian mission progression is now shared with allies in squads mode. The requirements are higher with more people - There is +1 extra heart drop at each minute before overtime. - It once again requires 3 kills instead of 2 to get the 3rd skill at levels 5 and 6 - Damage health kits now give +30 instead of +20 hp - Assault reload speed is now +100% instead of +70% - Sniper range is now +15% instead of +10% - Heavy's first perk is changed. It now is called ""Over Shield"": Standing in XP Pools will overheal your shield up to 100% of max health. Your normal max shield is also +20% larger. - Frenzy's ally buff radius is 50% larger - Shift Supply's mutation speed boost now lasts 2s instead of 1s - Armed Robbery will always drop at least one cash pile (if nothing else drops and not on cooldown) - Mirror Image clone health reduced by 4% - The Risky Traders modifier has been removed, and now replaced with Heavy's old medkits perk.",1752505386,['patchnotes']
308600,Welcome to Skillshot City!,"Welcome to Skillshot City Same game, new name. Gene Shift Auto has been renamed to Skillshot City! I'll explain why below, but first want to reassure everyone that you'll keep all of your account progress. This is simply a name change, but the game itself is the same (apart from some spicy gameplay tweaks mentioned below). If you want to read why the name was changed and what it means for the future of this game, read on. Otherwise, skip to the changelog below to see the gameplay changes.Check out the New TrailerWhy the Name Change?The main reason for the new name is to align the name with the gameplay, and attract the right kind of players. Players who'll enjoy the high skill PvP combat that the game now features in 2025. The original name was chosen because Gene Shift Auto sounded a lot like Grand Theft Auto. This game does after all have cops, missions, cars, gangsters and more - and whenever I'd post the game online the most upvoted comment was always, without fail, something like ""omg, this game looks just like GTA2!"". So I took that as a good sign that GTA was the main selling point and something to base the name on.However, after the game went F2P in 2022, this changed. Far more players started playing the game, and with these new players I got far more feedback. I got to observe what the much larger F2P playerbase actually cared about, and it wasn't the GTA stuff. The main thing players talk about now is the skills. The feedback is always about the skills. The combos, the synergies. What their skill build should be. What's broken, what needs a buff, how to improve the skill drafting system, etc.It became clear to me that while GTA2 makes for great screenshots and gets lots of comments online, it's not what actually keeps players in the game. Cops and missions are fun, but they're not where the replayabilty lies. They are simply a source of XP for what the game is really about - the skills. It no longer make senses to attract GTA2 fans if they're going to have ""seen it all"" after a few matches.Instead, we want a name that attracts high-skill PvP fans. Fans who like creating combos, getting flashy kills, mastering their build, and outplaying enemies. This is where the replayability of the game lies - not the cops and missions. This is what keeps you playing 100+ matches as you unlock and discover thousands of new and broken combos.And so, the name is now Skillshot City! This new name clearly has strong PvP vibes it attracgt PvP gamers. It puts a focus on the skills and the flashy skillshots you often use to win! This will attract more PvP gamers who would actually love this game, if they had only known to check it out in the first place. Now they will. We'll fill up our servers with fresh competition and get new voices in our community. Ultimately, this will get us more players, and help prepare the game for the v1.0 release.What's Next?The main focus now going forward is preparing for the big v1.0 release. After many years in Early Access, Skillshot City is a complete game that delivers hundreds of hours of fun for the right kind of gamer - the kind of gamer we will now be attracting. So my focus will be contacting streamers, the press, preparing marketing assets, and so on. I want to make the game as fun as possible, and the single best way to do that now is to just get us more players. More hype, fuller servers, more voices in the community, etc. This name change is the first step towards this, but I'll be spending the next few months really ramping up the exposure of the game. So now would be a great time to hop online and get involved in this new growing community!Happy skillshotting! bencelot. Full Changelog - Heart drops now come every 60s instead of every 30s.- There is +1 heart drop during overtime.- Hearts give 10/20/30xp based on the round.- Players with high kill streaks now drop extra cash when killed. This now goes up to a 20x streak, which will drop $10,000.- Slightly more gangsters spawn in the map.- Gangsters now explode in a larger radius (now the same size as explosive crates).- As a scientist, every vendor is guaranteed to sell chemicals if you don't yet own a chemical.- Scavenger's copy coin no longer duplicates Syringes.- Asssassinate slightly prioritizes players with high bounties.- The skill duration tag now applies to Combo Killer's mutation, allowing for even longer infinite shifting.- Mirror Image's clone health is now a percentage of your max health, ranging from 20 to 34%.- Shift Attack's mutation now restores more ammo per shift, ranging from 8 to 32% instead of 6 to 24%.- Frenzy cooldown is 1s faster.- Automatic Armor recharges every 10 instead of 12 seconds.- Smoke Bomb's mutation doesn't throw health kits quite as far away, making them easier for the owner to collect.- Shift Supply mutation reworked. It no longer restores shifts when you touch jump pads or XP Pools. Instead: Shift Supply now boosts your move speed for 1s after shifting, by +8/16/24/32%- Beefcake now gi...",1752066940,
308600,Legendary skills no longer give bonus skill points,"Hey all! This is a very simple change, but one that will massively level the playing field between new players and veterans. - When you mutate a skill at a vendor, it now always gives a flat +2 skill levels. It no longer gives +1/2/3/4 based on the rarity. This is pretty huge, as before veterans could get 3 mutations per match and get 3x4 = 12 bonus points. Whereas new players who might only have commons would get just 3x1 = 3 bonus points. 12 vs 3 is just too big of a difference. Now, all players will get 3x2 = 6. Far more fair! Rarity still matters for the strength of your mutations. And it also allows you to reach higher levels. So a legendary skill can be taken up to level 8, compared to a common reaching level 5. But you'll have to actually spend your points to get there, thus taking away from other skills. You no longer get the bonus points for free. Special thanks to Hank for this idea, and for the people who helped me think it through in more detail in Discord. This is a risky change from a business perspective, because part of the reason people grind and/or buy the DLC is to experience higher level skills. And that's now harder to do, as you don't get those extra points. But a fairer game is a funner game, and hopefully word of mouth and longer playtimes will make up for this. Enjoy! bencelot ---- - When mutating a skill, it now gives a flat +2 skill levels. It no longer gives +1/2/3/4 points based on rarity. - As rarity no longer determines skill points, to avoid confusion the rarity colours are no longer shown in the leaderboards and victory screen. - Random class now gives +0/15/20/21/22/23/24/25% instead of +0/15/25/26/27/28/29/30% cash and XP.",1750079600,['patchnotes']
308600,Common Skills Are Buffed!,"Hey all, this version makes a significant improvement to the skill rarity system, especially for new players! Here are the big changes: 1) You can now equip COMMON skills to your skill builds. You no longer need to get them to Rare status.2) You can now buy MUTATIONS for common skills as well. This will give +1 skill point (Mutating Rares now gives +2, Epics +3, Leges +4).3) Mutations for skills are now split into 4 steps instead of 3, allowing common skills to access the lowest tier of the mutation. Generally the gap between veterans and newbies is smaller now. For example a legendary mutation used to be 3x stronger than a rare mutation. But now it is only 2x stronger. New players will also be able to copy the skill builds that they see in the leaderboards, and be able to equip this reliably on ALL classes, instead of having to get Rare's first. And also, everyone can try out all the mutations the moment they unlock the skill!Enjoy!bencelot ----\- The Deluxe DLC now also gives a one-time +30 level boost (not that useful for vets, but good for new players).- 2x the amount of ACID is given when claiming level ups. It is now 100/300 instead of 50/150.- Full Flasks are now called ""Double Rare Flasks"" and they guarantee at least 2 rares (or higher) drop. Cost is now 1000 instead of 750.- Tweaked a few button colours, fixed a few bugs, and improved the tutorial.\- Common skills can now be equipped to builds and get mutations as mentioned above.- Skills can now go up to level 8 instead of level 7.- Most skills have an extra 8th skill point added to the end, bigger than the 7th. But some have been rescaled instead because an 8th point would be too busted.- Rescaled all of the mutation values for every skill, mostly to fit a 3/6/9/12 pattern instead of a 4/8/12 pattern.- Fixed a big bug where vendor skill upgrades were being applied to skills that didn't have that tag. This will fix a lot of broken builds.- XP Fountains now hold more XP and drain faster if you have random class/build modes applied.- Active skills generally have slightly longer cooldowns now (by about 2s).- Random skills mode now gives +15% instead of +10% ingame farm- Random classes now give +15/20/25/27/28/29/30% instead of +20/23/26/27/28/29/30%- Reduced down the amount of cash in the game. Slightly boosted the amount of health kits in R3. \- More trophies are awarded at the end of solos matches, with the potential to actually get 11 trophies for winning a solo game if there are enough high rank players in the server.- Fixed the zombie respawning algorithm to make it almost impossible to rspawn more than 250m away from an incoming heart drop- All healing skills are 50% as effective in the circle of death- You can no longer enter civilian vehicles. However, a single shot will force the civilian to jump out \- Executioner now only buffs bullet damage, not nades skills, etc- Killer Cooldowns gives half as much cooldown restoration to skills (chems and ammo are untouched)- Automatic Armor gives slightly less damage reduction- Regen has slightly slower healing- Blade Mail kicks in at 50% instead of 40% health, but with weaker damage reduction- Poison Trail has a 4s delay after triggering instead of a 2s delay- Charged Shot now gives a bit less damage after casting skills- Frenzy's base duration is 4s instead of 3s- Stimpacks mutation drop rate is a bit lower- Medical Supplies has slightly less healing- Shrapnel has slightly less chance to spawn nades in crates- Phase Drifting is a bit slower- Bullet Time has 3.5 instead of 4s duration- Energy Vortex has a slightly faster cooldown, but less healing- Flaming Bullets gets back the duration skill tag, and the duration now scales with level- Firestorm now does 50% damage at the edge of its splash radius instead of 100%. It's cooldown is slightly faster- Boots of Travel moves a tad faster.- Beefcake now gives a bit more max health.- Cluster Bomb now fires a fixed 1/2/3/4 bazookas at the end, instead of a fraction of the grenades thrown. \- Flaregun, Blast cannon, and Molotovs all now deal 50% damage at the edge of their splash radius instead of 100%.- M3 now has +1 bullet in the magazine and does 70 instead of 63 damage per shot.- SPAS now has 100 rpm instead of 120, but does 65 damage per shot instead of 54 (same DPS, but more bursty).- Blast Cannon now does 80 damage per shot instead of 60, but it's rpm is 90 instead of 120 (same DPS, but more bursty).",1749818383,['patchnotes']
308600,SKILL BALANCING,"Hey all, just a small balance and bug fixing update. This hopefully fixes the server crash issue that's been going on the last month, but if not please report it in the global chat to let me know. Enjoy! bencelot ---- Empty cars and civ/cop cars no longer take extra damage. It's the same damage as cars take when players are inside them. The warmup round no longer gives voting for a round modifier, so we play with just 2 per match instead of 3. 3 imho is just too much to keep track of and I often forget which ones are active. Also warmup needs time for ppl to chat and rest between games (or open flasks), which atm you can't do as you are required to win the warmup. Shields pickups give +20% instead of +10%, but are capped at 40% instead of 50% (it takes 2 kills to max out instead of 5, which allows noobs to catch up max level with vets fasters, and prevents vets snowballing once they hit 5+ kill streaks) Toned down the excessive brightness on critical bullets to improve visual clarity The camera view range is extended slightly Flaming Bullets dps ranges from 2 to 8 instead of 2.4 to 9.6 Vamprism healing is now 6% to 24% instead of 8% to 32% Laser Scope bullet speed ranges from +10% to +40% instead of +12% to +48% Radiate's explosion range is reduced slightly Energy Vortex cooldown is 2s longer at all levels Falling Inferno's damage ranges from 30% to 120% instead of 40% to 160% Regeneration's mutation restores ammo at 25/50/75% instead of 20/40/60% Automatic Armor recharges every 12s instead of every 15s Frenzy mutation reworked. It now adds a flat +2/4/6s to the frenzy duration when cast (so it becomes 5/7/9s), instead of adding it after each kill. Can't chain it anymore, but it's more reliable and noob friendly Stimpacks now has a 12/24/36% chance of a med-kit instead of 10/20/30% chance Clip Magnet now only takes 12/8/4s to recharge the other gun instead of 15/10/5s. Seeking speed is slightly higher too for all levels. Blade Mail's mutation now gives +15/30/45 damage per med kit instead of +10/20/30 Proximity Rounds mutation makes you charge rounds +150% faster when near gangsters instead of +100% faster Xray Vision's mutation now also shows ""hidden"" rare loot crates in the minimap. These are the crates that don't have a spawner underneath them. Smoke Bomb's mutation now spawns 2/4/6 med kits instead of 1/2/3 Hypnotic Army cooldown is 2s faster and has a slightly larger radius Poison Trail's chance of double damage is now 33/67/100% instead of 25/50/75% Charged Shot's mutation now restores 20/40/60 health instead of 15/30/45 Bullet Time seeking now ranges from 20 to 80 instead of 10 to 70 Illicit Incomes cash per wanted level now ranges from 10 to 40% instead of 8 to 32% Shockwave's cooldown is now 2s faster for all levels Invisibilty's mutation now goes up to 100hp damage instead of 60hp, and gains at a rate of 8/16/24 damage/sec instead of 5/10/15 Spike Trap makes enemies vulnerable for 4s instead of 3s Flying Dagger's base damage (to enemies above 50% health) is now 40% to 70% instead of 30% to 60% Gunslinger once again boosts your reload speed, ranging from +20% to +80%. The grenades don't fly quite as fast through the air as before Teleportation cooldown is now 3s faster for all levels Manic Mechanic's +50% rate of fire duration now lasts 6/12/18s instead of 4/8/12s Combo Killer's infinite shifting after a kill is now 2/4/6s instead of 1.5/3/4.5s Soul Drop's jump height out of XP Pools is now 15/30/45 instead of 10/20/30m - Hopefully fixed the server crash bug.",1747313269,['patchnotes']
308600,GSA v0.93: 54 New Skill Mutations!,"54 NEW SKILL MUTATIONS Mutate your skills to unlock new combos! Skills are the core of GSA. The first 90% of each match is spent leveling up as fast as you can to unlock skills and create strong synergies before the final showdown. Well this process just got a whole lot more interesting with skill mutations. https://i.imgur.com/dqaeFMO.png Every skill now has a ""mutation power"". This isn't active to begin with, but you can activate it at vendors by spending a new in-game currency called Syringes. A simple example of a mutation is the Self Repair skill. This normally just heals you, but if you activate it's mutation power it will ALSO make you move much faster for the 2 seconds that the heal is active. This opens up new ways to use the skill, like chasing or escaping from enemies. https://i.imgur.com/zxIMuW5.png 54 Unique Mutation Powers All 54 skills in the game have their own unique mutation power. Here are a few examples: - Radiate's mutation makes your own nukes heal you, allowing you to cast it on yourself. - Executioner's mutation causes enemies to explode when they die, creating chain reactions of cops exploding eachother. - Invisibility's mutation causes you to accumulate damage when standing near enemies, allowing you to stalk enemies to secretly charge up a powerful shot. - Flying Dagger's mutation makes your throwing knife fly back to you like a boomerang, allowing you to double hit enemies and do trick shots. - Bullet Time's mutation will steal all nearby enemy bullets and fire them back towards them (like in this image below). https://i.imgur.com/hrJln6u.png Activate Mutations with Syringes You get +1 syringe every 5 score you earn in game, and it works out so that most players will be able to activate either 2 or 3 mutations each match. But you'll usually have 5 skills, so you'll need to choose which skills you want to build around, as you can't mutate them all. Mutating a skill will also give that skill a big boost of skill points, based on the rarity of that skill, forcing you to really invest into the skill you're mutating. This is a big power spike, and makes it extra exciting to earn score and get that next syringe. The primary way to get score is to level up but also get kills during overtime, and this new incentive to get score ASAP gets players to really hunt kills during the final showdown moments, instead of hiding away. https://i.imgur.com/1WepvSD.png Full Changelog - When you die or respawn, all vendor options reset for you. - When zombies revive, they only start with 100 health, and will need to regen the reset. - Knife now does 70hp damage, with 60 rate of fire. Instead of 60hp damage, with 80 rate of fire. - Shadows from players in the air are more visible. - Bomb Boxes have a slightly bigger explosion radius. - Crate Race modifier can only be completed once per round. - The leaderboards now show players' actual builds used in-game. Not their builds from the menu. This includes the skill level and syringes. - Assault's reload speed is now +70% instead of +50%. -Fixed a bug where criminal's gangster could kill enemies. It now caps at 1hp like the rest of the gang. -Criminal's gangster has a 3% chance of appearing instead of a 5% chance when shifting. - Backtrack renamed to Teleportation. Teleportation will teleport you to your target after a short channeling time. After teleporting, it will heal you. - Combo Killer now drops loot starting at double kills, not triple kills. - Armed Robbery rewards are now only given once every 60s. A little indicator will appear above the vendor's head to show when it's ready to be killed again. Speed vendor upgrades speed this up. - Armed Robbery has higher drop rates to compensate. - Blade Mail no longer buffs the next bullet as it takes damage. Instead, Blade Mail will drop damage med kits as you take damage. - Rambulance no longer boosts your vehicle speed (too hard to drive with). Instead it will make your car take less damage. - Energy Vortex no longer slows enemies (for netcode smoothness reasons). It has been compensated by having a larger radius and doing more damage/healing. - Automatic Armor's protection duration is now 2s instead of 1.5. - Firestorm flies a bit slower through the air. - Assassinate's econ boost ranges from 30% to 120% instead of 40% to 160%. - Critical Rage's cooldown rescaled to 32 to 8s, instead of 30 to 12s. - Spike Trap's vulnerability time is 4s instead of 3s. - Clip Magnet has greater seeking, but takes longer to refill a clip. The seeking bullets also now expire when that gun reloads.",1744819060,
308600,ECON & SCORE POLISHING,"Hey all, this version just polishes up the econ and scoring systems a bit. It mostly plays the same with one key difference - how to score well. Your score from level ups is now capped at 20 (when you hit level 10). This is fairly easy for most veteran players to achieve, and so everyone will be equally on 20 points here. Instead, focus on outscoring enemies by getting more kills during overtime, and by winning the rounds 1 and 2 showdowns, which now give +5 score each (in hindsight they should have done this a long time ago). The reason for the score cap is that players were taking specific econ skills and classes just because they gave more XP, more levels, and thus more score. That's not a great incentive. It's still useful to take these classes because being a higher level makes you more powerful, but you'll now need to actually USE that power by killing enemies in showdowns if you want bonus score. You can't just automatically get more score than other players just by choosing the right class. Another benefit of this change is that it tones down the RUSH factor of GSA. GSA is all about farming, and of course you still want to outfarm your enemies. But now you no longer NEED to do this. You can afford to do other things that don't give farm (eg shop from vendors, place chemicals, fight gangsters) and not worry that you're falling behind in score. So this opens up more strategies to win, and also removes the psychologcal feeling of ""guilt"" that you're doing something other than grinding XP. Now you can chill out before overtime, and not rush. Use this time to prepare your build, then get a lot of kills and wins in overtime. Enjoy! bencelot ---- - Score earned from level ups is now capped at 20 (level 10) - We now get +5 score for winning rounds 1 and 2 - No new skill appears at level 15 - Deaths now remove 200xp instead of 100xp - Kills now give 50xp + 10xp x streak (capped at 100xp) instead of a fixed 100xp - Cops now give a flat 10xp and $100 per kill, instead of $50 + 10 x Wanted level - The main supply drop has an extra $1000 and 100xp in it - XP Fountains are now shown in the minimap - XP Fountains are now only disabled for 20s instead of 120s - Improved the pacing and difficulty of Survival mode. Also the Hostile Vendors modifier no longer hides vendors from the map. - Crate Race gives 1 vendor upgrade instead of 2, but only requires 20 instead of 30 crates - Force Field explosion damage is now 10 instead of 30 - Frenzy duration is now 2.5s instead of 3.0s - Falling Inferno damage now ranges from 40% to 160%, instead of 30% to 120%. However, by default it no longer gives extra molotov duration - Rambulance healing lasts for 10s instead of 6s - Illicit Income cash per wanted level is doubled. - Armed Robbery drops slightly more cash per vendor killed - Mana Shield duration is now 3s instead of 2.5s after using a skill - Proximity Rounds has a slightly larger trigger radius - Radiate has a slightly larger area - Laser Scope has slightly faster bullet speed but less range - Bazookas rpm is now 70 instead of 60 - Heavy gains +2.5% instead of +3.0% ROF when at low health - Scavenger shifts are +33% instead of +50% faster (when moving. Still +150% when standing still)",1740752014,['patchnotes']
308600,"He Who Controls the XP Pools, Rules","Hey all, this version replaces the old passive XP income with something more skillful - XP Pools. https://i.imgur.com/WNmBxcP.png Scattered around the map are a new special type of zone called an XP Pool. It looks a bit like a gangster camp, but it is blue. Standing inside this will give you XP, until you drain the pool. There are 15 of these to explore for in the map. Up the top right of the screen is a number that shows the amount of XP you're currently able to drain from these pools. This number gradually increases like a passive XP income. When it gets big enough you should seek out an XP Pool to claim it. This shifts this XP into your actual XP bar and levels you up. https://i.imgur.com/VFALCdW.png It takes a bit of time to claim the XP. Up to 8 seconds per pool. And enemies can attack you while you do this, so they can claim the pool themselves. This is a far more interesting way to earn XP than the old passive income. It creates new points of interest in the map to fight over, and some subtle strategies as to the optimal time to claim the XP. These XP Pools also serve a much needed purpose in GSA - forced downtime. It's only 8 seconds, but it's one of the only times in GSA that you can stand still and actually feel productive. All other times you are on your feet, hunting for kills and loot. These XP pools scattered around the map will give players short moments of rest, while still feeling productive. It's a great time to look at your build, think about your skills, and decide on your next synergy. Something that is much easier to do when you're chillin' in a pool, than cruising through the city streets of Gene Shift Auto. https://i.imgur.com/M3FbCFk.png Enjoy! bencelot ---- - Passive Income has been replaced with a mechanic called ""XP Pools"". - Reaching max shields no longer give +$1000. - Kills now give a flat 100xp always. They don't increase based on your kill streak. However, the amount of cash earned can still increase based on your streak (ranging from $100 to $500 on a 5x streak). - Vendors are less likely to spawn in a location where one has just died. - Armed Robbery now gives +$1000 instead of +100xp - Phase Drifting takes a bit longer to charge up to full speed - Flaming Bullets duration is now fixed at 1s, and ranges from 3 to 12 hp/s damage - Scavenger's new shifting perk is buffed to +50% shift restore speed instead of +33% - Random class and random skills modes no longer give bonus out of game XP (they still give in-game cash and XP though). This allows players to play whatever mode they genuinely prefer, instead of prioritizing these random modes purely for account progression. - Fixed a bug where epic random flasks wouldn't always give epics",1739904638,['patchnotes']
308600,"MORE SHOOTY SHOOT, LESS THINKY THINK","Hey all, just a small balance patch today. In a few weeks I'll release a larger update that gives every skill in the game a brand new special mutation that changes how it plays. Stay tuned for that! The main focus of this patch however is to simplify the gameplay. The feature above will add a bit more complexity, and GSA is already a fast and complex game! So this version is ""making space"" for this upcoming feature by removing some complex mechanics that are mildly fun, but not enough to justify their extra complexity, and ultimately just become a bit of a mental tax that you need to think about if you want to play well. I'll give some examples, but it's a bit wordy and you can just skip to the changelog for a quick list of changes. A good example is the penalty for death. This is now changed to give a flat 100xp penalty. If you die 6 times in a match, you'll have -600xp. Very simple. Just try to avoid dying. That's all you need to know and you can now go back to getting kills. The previous system however was more complicated. You lost 50% of your current XP towards the next level. This meant that if you just leveled up you'd lose a small amount, but if you were almost at the end you'd lose a lot! Now.. that is quite interesting. But it added a whole new level of complexity to the game. Good players needed to constantly check their XP bar to see where they were at, and know when they should take risks or not. Often though you'd forget this and then see a huge amount of XP drain away which felt bad. Ultimately, GSA is so fast-paced that it's more fun to just focus on getting clean kills, instead of having to constantly manage your XP bar. In a simpler or slower game this could be cool, but GSA is so fast it's just too much to focus on, and takes focus away from quality combat. Another example is that this version removes the rare loot icons in the minimap. It's another thing to keep track of, that gets your mind into the UI and out of the game itself. Now you can just focus on exploring the city itself, instead of heading to checkpoints in a map. Another mechanic that got cut was the ""first 3 kills of each round give bonus XP"" rule. This cluttered up the HUD and it's just simpler to give a flat +100xp per kill. Finally, rounds are 1 minute longer to give sufficient time to explore and shop before the circle pushes you into overtime. In general, this version should let you just exist in the city itself, and focus on quality combat without having to constantly check various parts of the HUD. Feedback is welcome of course! Enjoy! bencelot ---- - Wanted stars now appear in the middle of the screen when the ""WANTED LEVEL X/5"" message shows. - Holding ALT will now show the names of guns in the bottom right. - The ""PLAY VS BOTS"" button is renamed to ""PRACTICE MODE"" and it works slightly differently: - In Practice mode, you will become invulnerable if you stand still and avoid shooting for 1s. There are only 12 bots in the lobby, and they are easier. You can't earn trophies in this mode. This is a good mode for players to explore the mechanics, read UI elements and skill descriptions, without fear of being shot at. - Daily challenges give 250 acid and 2500 XP instead of 200 and 2000. - The Deluxe DLC will now give 3x instead of 2x to these daily challenges. And it gives 3x instead of 4x to the ACID level ups (150 instead of 200). This is overall a buff, and should give DLC players DLC roughly +1000 more ACID per day (aka 1 flask). - Legendary packs are only available to players who have bought the DLC or starter pack first. - Added a new ""CLAIM ALL"" button when leveling up. - There are now 4 minutes before overtime instead of 3. - The first 3 kills of the round rule has been removed. Too complex. Instead, all player kills give +100xp more than before. - When you die, you now lose a fixed 100xp, instead of 50% of your current XP progress. This removes the mental need to keep track of your current XP progress. - Rare loot crates no longer show in the minimap, nor do heart crates show for survivors. - It once again takes 3 kills instead of 2 kills to get the skill in the 3rd build slot at levels 4 and 6. - No new skill appears at level 12 anymore. This is moved back to level 15 (but almost no one ever reaches this). 5 skills is enough. - Hearts now give $100 instead of 10xp for survivors. - The civilian gangster mission and place chemicals mission no longer appear in round 1. - The kill zombies civ mission only requires 1 kill instead of 2. - Vendor upgrades do prices differently. Instead of the price going up per purchase across all upgrades. It goes up on a per upgrade basis. The first purchase costs $9000, then the next $12000, then the final one is $15000. - Vendor upgrades for skills won't appear if you don't have any skill that works with it. - Assassin only gains +15% instead of +20% upgrade power per kill. - Caster now get a -33% discount on skill upgrades instead of a -50% discount. - Scavenger's second perk h...",1739625762,['patchnotes']
308600,"Rescaling Uranium, +200 Free Uranium, & Minor Gameplay Tweaks","Hey all, this is a special announcement! URANIUM has been rescaled to 50% of it's previous value. This means the COSTS and REWARDS and BALANCES in everyone's account is now exactly 50% of the previous value. Relatively, nothing changes. If you notice that you have half as much uranium as before, this is why. But it is OK because everything is exactly half as expensive, so your purchasing power is the same as before. Actually, everyone's uranium has been scaled down to 50%, and then had +200 added for fun, and to make up for the confusion. Why make this change? Because it will align the prices with USD better. This change name makes 1000 uranium = $10 USD. This makes for easier maths, less confusion and more transparency. So basically everything was rescaled down 50%, with these exceptions (all of them make things cheaper and better for players): - Weekly challenges used to give 5/10/15/20/50 uranium (100 total). Now they give 5/10/15/20/25 (75 total, or the equivalent of 150 in old values). So they are +50% more rewarding. - Leaderboard rewards are also better. Genetic God used to give 600 uranium, now it gives 400, but it should have been rescaled down to 300. So at 400 it is +33% more rewarding. - All shop items got 50% cheaper. So did the cost of bonus daily challenges. But a few items got even cheaper than that: - Epic Flasks used to cost 400 uranium. Now they cost 150. - Epic Class Flasks used to cost 500, and now they cost 200. - Shard boosters used to cost 500, now they cost 200. - The uranium cost to swap DNA between classes used to be 30 x DNA%, but it is now 10 x DNA% (capped at 500). Hopefully this doesn't confuse anyone! Also, there are some small gameplay changes listed below. Cheers, Ben. ---- - Criminal's 3rd perk is now called ""Shifty Soldiers"": Every time you shift, there is a 3% chance to summon a gangster to join your gang (max 1). - Killing a criminal will also instantly kill his entire gang. - Magnets have a 20% hit rate instead of 15%. - There are now 18 instead of 24 players in a server - Fission mines from the Minefield perk are now visible instead of hidden - Assassin's upgrades gain +20% instead of +15% per kill - Assassin's no longer lose their potential next upgrade when they die. - In squads mode, you get $5000 instead of $3000 for capturing gang loot - As a survivor, hearts now display as XP - Score is now given automatically for kills in overtime, instead of having to pick it up - Dying once again removes all of your XP towards the next level. - Players no longer gain score for the final 5 placement - More loot pops out of enemies when you kill them",1737144157,['patchnotes']
308600,"GSA v0.90: Round Modifiers, Gangsters, Shards & More!","ROUND MODIFIERS Round modifiers change the game. In GSA there are 3 battle royale rounds per match. At the end of each round, all players will now vote on a round modifier. The modifier that wins will become active for the rest of the match, affecting all players equally and changing the rules of the game. https://i.imgur.com/2swNIZa.png In the screenshot above we see that there were 2 choices after I won the warmup. Crate Race: After opening 30 crates, you'll get 2 vendor upgrades. 360 No Scopes: Spinning 360 degrees briefly makes your next bullet do +25 damage. 360 No Scopes got more votes because it has more meme potential, and so for the rest of the match everyone was spinning in circles frantically trying to one-shot one another. Adapting to New Modifiers Modifers don't just add roguelitey variety. They also adds strategic depth. For example, with 360 No Scopes you might want to pivot to a sniper build, because sniper rifles have a long delay between shots anyway, giving you time to do a quick twirl before your next shot. Sticking with an SMG however won't let you make much use of this modifier, because you'd be better off just aiming at the enemy as you spray. Once you decide to pivot to a sniper build, you'll then start making other choices in-game, like taking sniper-friendly skills that give you faster bullets. Before you know it, you're running a completely different build to the previous match, all because this wacky modifier won the vote. But had Crate Race won instead, you could go for something totally different (like movement speed skills to loot extra fast). GSA's gameplay was already quite varied due to the random skill drafting, but with 3 round modifiers in each match and thousands of possible combinations, no two matches will ever be the same. https://i.imgur.com/UPnk17a.png Round Wins Now Matter The cool thing about this feature is that if you win the round, you get far more influence over the vote. You not only get more votes than everyone else, but you get to decide what is even voted upon in the first place! This is determined by your modifier build. https://i.imgur.com/k0Du7sS.png In the screenshot above you can see I created a build for the Assassin class (the 6 modifiers shown on the right). Whenever I win a round while playing as Assassin, this build is used, and 2 of the modifiers are randomly selected for voting. In this case it was Crate Race and 360 No Scopes. But I would have been happy for ANY of these modifiers to show up, because I specifically equipped modifiers that synergize nicely with the Assassin class. This synergy potential makes round wins really matter. Because no matter what gets voted on, you can be sure that as the round winner, the next modifier that appears will combo nicely with your class and playstyle. https://i.imgur.com/ef1VhA3.png UNLOCK MODIFIERS WITH SHARDS With this version, there are 54 modifiers in the game, with more to be released soon! These modifiers are split into 18 commons, 12 rares, 12 epics, and 12 legendaries. Players start with all the commons unlocked and can start creating builds immediately. But to get the rest, you'll need to spend shards. https://i.imgur.com/ObjwTx9.png Spend Shards to Get Modifiers Shards are a currency that you mostly get from leveling up your classes. When you get 100 shards, you can spend them to supercharge your next flask and make it drop a modifier. Doing this gives you a 10% chance to drop a legendary modifier, a 35% chance to get an epic or higher, and a 100% chance to get a rare modifier or higher. In the screenshot above I unlocked the legendary Thug Drops modifier, which changes how gangs work (more on gangs below!). Now I am free to equip Thug Drops to my modifier builds and give it a chance to appear when I win my next match. It is also possible to get new modifiers without spending shards, but this is extremely unlikely. It's just a 0.2% chance to get a random legendary modifier for free in any flask. This is just for fun, and shards are the main way. Also, if you hit a duplicate modifier in the flask, that's OK. Those 100 shards will get turned into 100 ENRICHED SHARDS instead, which lets you buy legendary modifiers directly from the shop. https://i.imgur.com/Nc5yWp5.png Sharing The Love The thing I love about this system is that you share these unlocks with others. You don't just unlock Thug Drops for yourself, no. It is a round modifier that affects everyone in the server. This means it's not just veteran players with 100+ hours in the game that get to experience this content. Whenever they win, we all get to try out some of the crazy legendary modifiers that they've unlocked. It also means that if you're a more casual player, you can still get lucky, unlock a sweet legendary modifier, and be one of the only players in the entire game who has the ability to make this specific modifier appear. There will be many players who don't have that modifier, and haven't even played it before. And then sudd...",1736527917,
308600,"GSA v0.85: New Visuals, a Shop, Explosive Boxes and More!","A BUNCH OF STUFF This is a summary of the biggest changes over the last few months. A few of these features have been live for a while, but I hadn't made a Steam announcement for them yet. If you've played the game recently you might have seen some of these, but if not, here's what's new in the world of GSA! https://i.imgur.com/tSApv8f.jpeg Explosive Boxes There are fun new ways to kill people. Some of the loot crates are now shown in red. These are explosive and will deal 60hp damage to anyone nearby, including yourself! If you want to claim the loot inside them you should shoot them from afar first, as running into them to open the crate will hurt. They crates also deal extra damage vs vehicles and are a great way to initiate a fight! https://i.imgur.com/oyIUKBE.png https://i.imgur.com/809FCtU.gif Car Physics Kills Even cooler, when cars explode the car body will now blast forwards out of the explosion. The car will deal huge roadkill damage as it slides across the ground, killing anyone caught in it's path. So now you can set traps by parking cars in chokepoints. I like to drive a car up to an incoming supply drop where I know a lot of enemies will be, and then pull off trick shots like these. https://i.imgur.com/gXVLaZL.gif Pretty Graphics Various parts of the game look better. The lighting is more vibrant and colourful. The circle of death is easier to see as it now has a little row of dots showing its edge. https://i.imgur.com/aMqFt4c.png https://i.imgur.com/S8U1N1J.png The Uranium Shop Players can now finally spend their Uranium! If you have or buy the Deluxe Edition DLC, you will get a bonus 3000 uranium, but everyone can also earn uranium for free. Daily challenges, leveling up, and opening flasks all give uranium, which you can spend in the new shop. The shop displays new offers every day, selling things like ACID, Magnets, direct DNA purchases and various Flasks. Most popular are the class-specific flasks, which guarantee Epic or Legendary drops for your favourite classes. Uranium makes account progression more strategic and gives you more control over how your account progresses. You can even wishlist your favorite skills by right clicking on them, and they will appear in the shop more often, allowing you to buy DNA directly on your favorite skills and classes. https://i.imgur.com/DHWwRe8.png Progression & Flasks Streamlined The new progression system has seen many improvements since it was released 5 months ago. Huge thanks to all the Early Access testers who gave feedback on this! Flasks are more convenient to claim as there are no longer any inventory limits. You can stack flasks infinitely. You have the option to convert regular class flasks into Epic flasks. This means that flasks for the classes you don't play are no longer useless. You can turn them into Epics which are always useful. The flask animation got a lot of criticism for being too slow, so that has been sped up 2x faster. And there is also a new ""QUICK MIX"" option that removes the animation entirely (except for when an Epic or Legendary is about to pop out). https://i.imgur.com/YysBKCI.png Automatic Skill Builds The recently added skill builds got a huge improvement due to the new ""Auto Build"" feature. By clicking the AUTO button the game will automatically assign 12 skills to your build for you. It chooses these skills based on 3 factors. The rarity of the skill, hardcoded synergies that I know work well with that specific class, and most importantly, your personal skill usage. The game will track how much you use each skill based on your ""votes"" when you click the skills during drafting in-game. Then based on this information it creates a build that prioritizes your favourite skills. It works pretty well, and is convenient for new players who aren't sure what skills they like yet. https://i.imgur.com/C9Eli58.png New Survivor Income Loot Drops The survivor income is the biggest source of XP in the game. This is a battle royale after all, and survival needs to matter. But it used to work in a fairly confusing way. Now it works like this: Roughly once per minute, every survivor in the game will receive a special supply crate that lands right next to them. This contains a huge amount of XP, far more than you will get from other sources like cops, missions or kills. Only survivors get this though, not zombies. So if you want to farm up and become as strong as possible for the round 3 showdown, you need to stay alive! This mechanic is more visual and intutive to new players. But it also adds interesting gameplay considerations for veterans. You get a 3 second warning before your box drops, which gives you just enough time to get to safety to claim it. You can also claim other player's income boxes, if you can somehow kill them before they claim it. The semi-random nature of the drops means you never know when it will come, and so when you hear the warning beeps you have to think fast to ensure you successfully claim this huge source...",1726829837,
308600,RANDOM CLASSES & CLASS LEVEL UPS,"Heyo! Just a small patch today. There are some balance changes and a rework to how we earn Shards. Shards still don't do anything, so this rework doesn't really matter yet. But we now earn them from leveling up our classes. We also need a certain number of Legendary skills in a class to reach the next level. To make sure we all get the right class level and get the correct amount of Shards, I've had to roll back everyone's class levels a bit. This will let you reclaim up to the new right class level, get the right amount of shards, and also get a free +300 ACID for each class level up. Woo! This version also now has a RANDOM CLASS BUTTON. This is to encourage players to experiment and get more variety in their gameplay. You will gain a slight +15% cash and XP boost to compensate for the lack of reliability. Or randomize your skills too for +30%! Enjoy! ---- - Made the chat log bigger and integrated Discord. - Daily challenges must now be claimed from the main menu. - Added pretty visual effects whenever you claim resources in the menu. - Added a coming soon button for the shop. - Shards are no longer earned from earning excess DNA on your legendary skills, nor are they earned from leveling up. - Shards are instead earned by levelling up your classes. You get +30 shards and +300 ACID per class level up. - Class levels now have 2 requirements. You need X amount of trophies like before, but now you also require a certain number of legendary skills on that class. - This makes higher class levels harder to reach, so to compensate, gun skin cosmetics are now unlocked at earlier combined class levels. - Everyone's shards have been reset and class levels rolled back, so you can re-level your classes to get up to the new amount, and get the right amount of shards. - FYI, Shards will eventually be used to unlock alternative class perks, letting us swap existing perks out for new ones. Coming soon! - Excess DNA that you earn when a skill reaches Legendary is no longer turned into shards. Instead it is stored on the skill itself. - For every 5000 excess DNA that you earn, your skill will gain +1 medal level (the old way of earning skill medals is removed). - These medal levels contribute towards your total class medal count, which is a new requirement used to unlock higher class levels. - It now takes 5000 instead of 4500 DNA for a skill to reach legendary status. All players have their existing epic and legendary skills boosted by +500 DNA to compensate. - You can now make progress towards your next magnet from earning excess DNA (previously excess DNA didn't count and was ""wasted""). - Shotguns have 35 instead of 30m range and slightly better accuracy. - Rare loot crates spawn more frequently in the map. - Vendor skill duration upgrades are now +25/50/75% instead of +30/60/90%. - Vendor skill speed upgrades are now +30/60/90% instead of +20/40/60%. - Added 2 new ""random class"" options that become available when you hit level 100. - Random Class: Play a random class, prioritizing daily challenges if available. Your skill build will match the selected build on that class. You earn +15% cash and XP from all sources in-game, and get +15% XP at the end of the match. - Random Class & Skills: Play a random class, prioritizing daily challenges if available. You'll use a random skill build, but get +1 extra reroll.. You earn +30% cash and XP from all sources in-game, and get +30% XP at the end of the match. - Vendors are more likely to carry chemicals, especially during round 1 (buffing Scientist). - Criminal's gang now fires at enemy cops and civs who are attacking and hunting you. - Charged Shot now only gives half as much damage after throwing a grenade - Shrapnel chance of free nade now ranges from 40% to 160% instead of 100% to 400% - Mirror Image clone damage is now 12% to 30% instead of 10% to 40% - Radiate initial impact damage is now 10 to 70hp instead of 20 to 80hp - Falling Inferno duration is now +2 to +5s instead of +2 to +8s - Toxic Blood duration is now +4 to + 7s instead of +4 to +10s - Automatic Armor protection time is now 1.5s instead of 1s - Blade Mail has more protection, ranging from -14% to -56% instead of -10% to -40% - Combo Killer now drops more loot per multi kill level, ranging from 40% to 160% instead of 30% to 120% - Armed Robbery's chance of a free upgrade now ranges from 8% to 32% instead of 6% to 24% - Firestorm's cooldown now ranges from 16s to 10s instead of 20s to 14s - Spike Trap's cooldown now ranges from 18s to 12s instead of 20s to 14s",1720774512,['patchnotes']
308600,DNA RESET,"Oops, I fucked up. I accidentally wiped everyone's DNA while working in the database. This is super embarrassing and I'm really sorry! The backups were also too old to use (though I've now made sure this can never happen again). Here's the plan to fix this. We're going to RESPEC our builds: 1) First of all, everyone over level 10 gets +1000 free uranium as an apology (equal to $10 USD, usable in the shop next version). 2) Everyone's ACID has been refunded. 3) Everyone's level is back to 0 (but XP is NOT reset). This allows us to very quickly reclaim all the flasks and get back to where we were before. 4) Flasks and shards are reset (as you'll re-earn all of these as you open the flasks again). Magnets earned from DNA are reset for same reason. Overall, we will all have roughly as much DNA as before. The big downside is that it will be a pain to open all those flasks in a row. To open them faster, hold SHIFT when you click the MIX FLASK button! The upside is that we'll all be a bit richer than before, as you get to keep the ACID, uranium, new skills, and magnets you previously unlocked from non-DNA sources, as well as the +1000 free uranium. Also, this is an opportunity to reuse your magnets to perfectly craft your builds. I'm really sorry about this, I screwed up hard! Please send me a message on Steam if you have any problems. In other news, there are some fun things in this version! Progression is way smoother now, with the ability to infinitely stack flasks. Scoring in PvP is now based entirely on placement, and F2P players can now attempt ALL survival challenges. Let's see who gets the top score! Enjoy! (and again, sorry for the fuckup.) ---- - Each class now has 3 builds slots, so you can create multiple skill builds per class. - Right clicking on skills will wishlist them, which will make them appear more often in the shop. You can do this from leaderboards, the skill tree, or when opening flasks. - Scoring in BR is completely reworked! We no longer get score for levels or kills. This removes the need to grind non-stop to keep up. Instead, we receive score based ONLY on our placement each round. - The scores for placement are awarded to the final 10 players of each round: + 1/2/3/4/5/6/8/10/15/20 score (these values are for round 1. Rounds 2 and 3 are bigger). - We no longer earn bonus health based on round placement, as we earn score instead. More health kits spawn in the map to compensate. - If you damage a player but then within the next 10s they die to cops, then you are given the kill. - The player hitbox is now slightly smaller, and all guns deal 10% less damage. - The amount of XP you can get from ingame farming is capped at 6000 instead of 8000. - Winning a BR match now gives much more XP. XP rewards range from 6000 to 2000xp, instead of 2000xp to 100xp. - In warmups, instead of the circle closing in super tight which looks quite ugly, everyone just dies when the timer hits 0:00. - All flask types can now be stacked up to 999 each per slot. - Flask inventory size is 24 for all players, F2P and Deluxe. - Sped up the flask animation 2x. You can hold SHIFT when opening flasks to make it even faster. - Class flasks once again only give 2 instead of 3 drops for that class. - Class flasks can now only be sold in batches of 3 at a time. However they give 100 ACID each instead of 50 each (so 300 for a batch of 3). - The Epic Skill Flask is now called ""Epic Class Flask"" and gives a random class instead. - XP flasks now cost 2000 instead of 3000 ACID. - Chance of unlocking a ring 4 skill is now 10% instead of 5%. - F2P players can now complete all survival challenges, and not just the first row. This allows all players to compete on the daily leaderboards for top score. - Removed the bonus XP from win streaks in survival mode. It's better for people to be able to take risks and experiment with harder survival modifers, without fear of losing the streak. - The bonus XP from difficulty modifiers in survival mode now only apply when you win the run, in the same way the bonus score works. - The ""Adaptation"" survival difficulty modifer is changed. It used to only show you 1 skill option instead of 2. Now it gives you 1 less reroll. - The final round of survival now also has a zombie swarm. - Criminal's gang members will no longer trigger fission mine. - Scientist's Alchemic Network no longer restores your health when enemies are nearby. However it gives $1000 instead of $500 per enemy death, and the range is much larger. - Scientist's Potent Chemicals perk now additionally makes chemicals be on discount from vendors. - Sniper's bonus range is now +15% instead of +20%. - Killer Cooldowns now also restores the cooldowns of your chemicals, by 5% to 35% restored per kill. - Falling Inferno no longer throws another molotov when you toggle off certain skills (like Invis or Bullet Time). - Critical Rage duration now ranges from +40% to +160% instead of +50% to +200%. - Invis duration now ranges from 6 to 24s instea...",1719586839,['patchnotes']
308600,Version 0.811: Shifty Shoot Shoot!,"Spicy changes this version! 1) All classes can now shoot while shifting. Instead of your gun being disabled, it will shoot with worse accuracy instead. This used to be Assault's perk, which now gets +15% bullet speed instead. 2) The skill build system has been restructured a bit. We can now equip Legendary skills into the Epic and Rare slots. This solves a problem where once you got 2 Legendary skills on a class, any new Leges felt kind of useless. 3) The game will now Auto-Level your skills if you join a game mid-match in rounds 2 or 3. This way we can just start playing, and not have to click 10+ times. The auto-leveling takes skills from your build and still gives Leges etc. There are also a few changes to Flask types, making them more powerful and interesting. Read on below! ---- - Daily challenges for playing specific classes now work in the Conquest game mode. - Sped up ranked mode slightly, making it so players don't have to grind as much to reach higher ranks. - Made some UI improvements to the Flask inventory. Also added a new PURCHASED tab, which doesn't do anything yet, but will become a place to store flasks that you buy with Uranium. - Changed bot behaviour to no longer priortize attacking the winning player in the server. This is usually a human and felt unfair. - Jumping on flat ground no longer makes your accuracy worse. Only if you jump really high in the air. - We can now shoot while shifting on all classes! However your accuracy is worse due to the movement. Machine guns and Rifles have a lot of inaccuracy, while SMGS and pistols have less. - When players join mid-match, they start with the average number of extra damage and health kits collected so far in the server. This is how XP and cash already worked. - When players join mid-match, the game will auto level skills for them. This simulates a player just spamming the right-hand side skill draft button (where your build appears). - The skill build system now allows Legendaries and Epics to show up at lower rarities. - The skill build is now split into 3 sections, clearly indicated in the menu. There is a new rule that you are guaranteed to see a skill from each of the 3 sections once per match. This helps you create synergies and combos. If you have a combo of 3 skills, put 1 in each section for a chance to play all 3 in a match. - Added a bounty system (patched live a week ago). When you get 4 kills in a row (OWNAGE!), $2000 appears above your head. Enemies who kill you get this reward. This grows up to $6000 if you get 12 kills in a row. - Magnetic Flasks now only require 1 magnet to use, but they cost 3000 instead of 1500 ACID. - XP Flasks now give +50xp instead of +20xp per DNA earned, but they cost 3000 instead of 1000 ACID. - Catchup flask is improved. Instead of only giving DNA to your least played class, it gives it to all classes except your 2 most played classes. It still only costs 500 ACID to open. - Created a new flask type called ""Legendary Class Flask"". This is a legendary flask with a twist! It tells you what class the Legendary will be for. This changes every day at 0:00 UTC, and also whenever you open a flask. - Mystery flasks no longer give class specific Legendary flasks (as you might get stuck with a class you don't like). Instead they give the new ""Legendary Class Flask"" which gives more control over what class you get. - Assault's first perk is now ""You will move +10% faster, and your bullets travel +15% faster."" It no longer lets you shoot while shifting, as ALL classes get that now. - Caster's skill cooldowns are now +50% instead of +60% faster. - When Criminals are undercover they no longer appear to enemies in the minimap. Your gang now does 70% instead of +65% regular cop damage. - Scientist's bombs will appear more frequently at vendors (50% instead of 33% of the time). - Assassin's bullets seek slightly faster during the 2s kill window. - Blade Mail's max bonus damage cap is now 100 instead of 50. - Shift Attack's bonus damage now lasts for 0.8 instead of 1.0s after shifting. - Firestorm flies 10% faster through the air. - Firestorm cooldown is now 20/19/18/17/16/15/14 instead of a flat 20s. - Radiate's explosion area is reduced by 10%. - Laser Scope's bullet speed and range is reduced by 20%. - Cluster Bomb takes 0.2s longer to throw grenades for all levels. - Stimpacks heals 1 less hitpoint per shift for all levels. - Mirror Image health now ranges from 20 to 80 instead of 30 to 120. - Venom Shot seeking is now 40 instead of 50 degrees per second. - Charged Shot damage now ranges from 16 to 64 instead of 12 to 48. - Medical Supplies now pulls loot from big supply crates at 50% instead of 35% the distance. - Phase Drifting speed is now +40 to +160% instead of +50 to +200%. - Xray Vision has a higher range and reveals more enemies at higher levels. This range now also reveals rare loot crates further in the minimap. - Rambulance healing linger duration is 6 instead of 5s after you exit a car. - Backtrack co...",1716890315,['patchnotes']
308600,Version 0.806: Auto Skill Builds!,"Hey all! This is just a small polishing version. You might see that the version number is now 0.806 instead of 1.806. I should have done this a long time ago. As Gene Shift Auto is still in Early Access, it makes sense to save 1.0 for the full release (soon tm). The main feature in this version is a new AUTO SKILL BUILD button. Clicking this automatically creates a skill build for that class, from the skills you have available. This should make build creation faster. The skills chosen for your build are a combination of: 1) Your most used skills. When you choose skills in-game, the game remembers the skills that you click most often, and assumes they are your favorites. These are prioritized in build making. 2) Specific class synergies. Some skills synergize especially well with a certain class. For example, Shift Supply works well with Assault because Assault can shoot while shifting. These skills get a bonus boost as well. There are also a few small balance tweaks shown below. I've patched a few of these out already and mentioned them in the DEV-UPDATES chat channel, but here's a summary of the latest few changes. Enjoy! ---- - The version number is now shown as 0.XXX instead of 1.XXX. - Added a new AUTO skill build button as mentioned above. - You can now remove skills from build slots by clicking a little X on the button (right click also works). - After level 200 you can now sell class flasks from within the inventory. So you don't have to decide immediately if you want it or not. Just claim it and sell them later. - The builds shown on the leaderboards now shows their most recent WINNING build played. It doesn't update if the player doesn't win. - Players can now toggle the supporters medallion off, including in global chat and leaderboards. - Supply Drops in the final BR round always drop an upgrade. - Heart drops now spawn every 30s instead of every 60s. - When a heart drop lands, the icon changes in the minimap to show it's an available crate, not an incoming drop. - Heart crates continue to spawn during overtime (1 will spawn in squads mode and 2 in FFA, every 30s). - Zombie kills continue to give +1 heart, but you no longer get free vision of zombies during overtime. - Assault's move speed is now +10% instead of +12%. - Criminal's gang does 65% instead of 50% damage. - Heavy's health kits now restore 25% of your MISSING health instead of 20% of your MAX health. Save them till the end! - Caster's cooldowns are now only +60% faster instead of +100%. - Scientist's bombs now deal +30% damage instead of +20%, blast you higher into the air, and are more frequently found at vendors. - Scientist's Alchemic Network gives +1 clip and +$1000 instead of +0.5 clips and +$500 per enemy death. - Fixed a bug where Xray Vision wouldn't show enemies on the minimap. - Sonar Cells chemical no longer increases your view range. Instead it gives your bullets +7 degrees of seeking. - Fission Mine's passive no longer gives +1 grenade every 40s. Instead it makes your explosives have +20% explosion size. - Chemicals now have 2 instead of 3 charges - Chemicals now cost $6000 instead of $7000 - Chemicals take 2.5 instead of 3.0s to neutralize - Updated Chinese and German translations.

308600,"GSA 0.80: Flasks, Skill Builds, and 3 New Classes!","OPEN FLASKS & CREATE BUILDS! Finally! Something to do. This is GSA's biggest version yet. It completely reworks the progression system, turning 36 skill unlocks into over 1000 skill rarities! We get these rarities by combinging ACID with a new resource called FLASKS. These skill rarities can then be used to equip your favorite skills and create cool skill builds. https://i.imgur.com/5UsRFMx.png This is an important version as it FINALLY gives GSA's biggest fans something to work towards. The old progression system was very simple. You would unlock 36 skills and then you're done. That only took about 30 hours, and then.. nothing. All the ACID you earned from doing challenges and playing matches couldn't be spent on anything, as there was nothing left to unlock. Some players have stockpiled millions of ACID over the years. Well now we finally have a system to work towards again, and this one will last a LOT longer. It's more fun when each match gives you real meaningful progress, so lets see how it works! https://i.imgur.com/uGTCAyV.gif Here is a summary of the new features, roughly in the order that we use them: https://i.imgur.com/w0D0QH1.png 1) New Progression Track: As we earn XP we can move up this track and claim flasks. We can also get ACID, Magnets and other resources. Click your account level up the top left to view this. As you go up the track new types of flasks will become available. These special flasks are more advanced and require strategic thinking to use well. There are fun milestones to work towards, such as a Legendary Flask at level 100, which is guaranteed to give you a Legendary skill. https://i.imgur.com/oKYCJyS.gif 2) New Currencies: Most important are Flasks and Magnets. These 2 new currencies are combined with our existing currency of ACID to generate DNA. DNA is what lets us equip our skills to our builds. As you earn more DNA on a skill it will increase in rarity, allowing you to see it more frequently in your skill build. There are also 2 other currencies called Uranium and Shards, but they don't do anything yet. A shop will be added in a future version. But I've included these currencies now so players can start stockpiling them ahead of time. https://i.imgur.com/BSVZwd2.png 3) Flask Inventory: There are different types of flasks. Starter flasks, Legendary flasks, etc. They go into your inventory on the Unlocks page. Here you can see I'm about to open a ""Heavy Booster Flask"", which costs 500 ACID. This gives a bunch of DNA specifically for the Heavy class. 4) Opening Flasks: Select a flask and spend ACID to open it. This shows a groovy animation and gives you random DNA on skills and classes. 5) Spending Magnets: When opening flasks you can also spend Magnets to guarantee DNA for a specific skill. This is very useful. Normally, Flasks give random DNA (like you would get random cards in other deck building games like Magic or Hearthstone). But Magnets let you control EXACTLY what gets DNA, so you can play with your favorite skills. https://i.imgur.com/uGTCAyV.gif 6) Class/Skill DNA: Each class has its own skill tree, with DNA on its skills. As you earn DNA your skills become Rare, Epic, then Legendary. These are indicated with blue, purple and yellow skill icons. In this image we can see that the Assault class has got 3 skills up to Legendary status. https://i.imgur.com/xDyozLB.png 7) Skill Builds: Each class has a build of 12 skill slots. There are 2 Legendary slots, 4 Epics slots, and 6 Rare slots. To equip a skill to a slot you first need enough DNA. For example, you need 500 DNA to equip a skill to the Rare slot. 1500 is required for Epic, and 4500 for Legendary. Here is a closeup of the Sniper class after a few hours of play. Some rarities have already been unlocked, with ""Illicit Income"" already equipped in a Legendary slot! Now, how do builds work? We don't see ALL 12 skills each game. That would be very repetitive. Instead, the game will show you 1 Legendary, 1 Epic and 1 Rare. This means that the skills you equip are more likely to appear, but not guaranteed. As there are only 2 Legendary slots, Illicit Income is going to appear in 50% of matches, and the other Legendary in the other 50%. In this case the other Legendary slot is empty, which means that it will be populated with a random skill. As there are 6 Rare slots however, you only see them 17% of the time. So Legendary is naturally better than Rare. If you really like a skill, you should Magnet it often so it accumulates DNA fast and reaches Legendary status. This will allow you to see if far more often than other skills. https://i.imgur.com/xYBY5xW.png CRIMINAL class unlocks at level 50: - Gang Warfare: Civs and cops join your gang, following you and shooting enemies. Your max gang size is 3. - Undercover: You'l disguise yourself as a cop when at full health. Your health bar and any status effects on you are hidden to enemies. - Five Star Man: The time between cop waves is reduced by 50%. Killing cops restores +30 ...",1713548233,
308600,Making death matter with the Survivor's Income,"Hey all, this version places a larger focus on SURVIVAL by introducing the Survivor's Income. When you're a survivor you will passively gain cash and XP over time. When you're a zombie however, this income is paused. You can see your Survivor Income growing up the top-right of the screen. The cash and XP shown will be given to you when you get your next kill. Then the income resets and starts counting up again. This means that you don't have to go crazy hunting for kills, as you'll get paid the same rate anyway. GSA is a Battle Royale and so it should have high-stakes around dying. But previously death only really mattered during overtime. Now death always matters, and the fastest way to farm is to play wisely and focus on quality kills only. Enjoy! bencelot ---- - The Kill Reward is now called Survivor Income, and it now only grows while you're a survivor. - It will grow at $1200/min in round 1, $2400/min in round 2, and $3600/min in round 3. - For XP it grows at 120/min in round 1, 240/min in round 2, and 360/min in round 3. - During overtime it will grow 2x faster, making it extra beneficial to be alive in this time. - Survivor Income is capped at $9999 and 999 XP. Make sure you get a kill before it caps out or you'll miss out on income. - Cash and the Survivor Income are now shown up the top right of the screen, near the buy menu. - We no longer lose 10% of our cash on death. Being a zombie and missing income is the new penalty. - Supply Drops and Rare Loot now give more cash and XP in round 2, and even more in round 3. - Streak Points now give +$5000 when you hit 5/10/20/30 instead of 5/10/15/20/25/30. - Vendor upgrades continue to get more expensive up to a cap of $20,000 instead of $10,000. - The final 6 players now get +5/10/15/20/25/30 max hp instead of +100/200/300/400/500/600xp. - Players once again gain +5 max hp per level instead of +10. However there are more health kits in the map to compensate. - Max health is now capped at 500 instead of 300. - Weapon damage now gives +6% instead of +5% per tier. - Weapon bullet speed is now +25% instead of +20% per tier. - Weapon rate of fire is now +8% instead of +6% per tier. - Caster skill vendor upgrades are once again +50%, not +100%. - Caster's active skills now restore +20% of MAX health instead of a fixed +30hp when cast. They also get +70% cooldown speed instead of +50%. - Heavy's shield goes back to -3hp below 50%. - Heavy's health kits drop half as often, but give twice as much health. Easier to use. - Scavenger passive healing is now +100% faster instead of +150% faster. - Assault move speed is now +10% instead of +12%. - Sniper damage at range is now +20% instead of +25%. - Executioner damage now ranges from 8 to 32 instead of 10 to 40%. - Nailgun clip size is now 30 instead of 25.",1707302642,['patchnotes']
308600,"DRIVEBYS, SKILL TAGS & SCAVENGERS","Hey all, this version adds a new class called Scavenger! Scavenger is all about looting. If you collect 50 bits of loot in a row without dying, you will hit the jackpot and suddenly double all of that farm. Scavenger also gets free loot for damaging enemies, and can heal much faster by standing still. This version also changes how the skill upgrades from vendors work. Skill upgrades no longer affect just one individual skill (eg: +20% Firestorm damage), but instead affect ALL skills that apply (eg: +10% to all damage skills). This is cool because we can make synergies. For example Firestorm, Executioner and Radiate all have the +DAMAGE tag, which means buying that upgrade will buff all 3 of them at once! Other neat changes are the ability to shoot while driving cars and some changes to the economy. Enjoy! bencelot ---- - Class icons are no longer shown during the warmup round. - Removed the skill stats tracking system that displayed skill medals. These didn't really do anything and added too much confusion. These will be reintroduced in a different way in a later version. - Daily challenges now give +5000xp instead of +2000 (or +10,000xp if you have Deluxe DLC). - 2x as much loot falls into the centre during showdowns. - Players who join a game halfway through, in R2 or R3 spawn with a tier 1 gun in addition to their USP. Skills are no longer auto-levelled for players. - When zombies get 4 hearts they will now respawn somewhere nearby, so they can continue their existing fight. - Players now gain +10 instead of +5 max hp per level, but level up slower and fewer random health kits exist in the map. - Skill upgrades purchased from vendors now affect ALL skills, allowing for some cool synergies between skills that share the same tag. - There are 6 tags you can upgrade: Cooldown Speed, Skill Damage, Skill Duration, Skill Size, Skill Speed, Skill Healing. - Check the skill tree to see what tags each skill qualifies for. Most skills are affected by multiple tags. - Vendor upgrades are now more expensive, costing $6000, then $8000, then $10000. - You can now fire guns while driving cars! Doing so gives you +15 degrees of inaccuracy. - Vehicles have less health and provide a bit less protection to compensate. - Improved vehicle netcode. It shouldn't rubberband if your car explodes anymore. - More vehicles spawn in the map and bots drive them more frequently. - When we die, instead of losing 10% of our kill reward, we lose 10% of our unspent cash. - Missions no longer give upgrades, instead they give a fixed +$3000 and +300xp per mission. - Getting 5 streak points now gives $5000 instead of 500xp. - Tightened up the levelling curve, slowing down the rate we level up, and giving new skills on levels 1/2/4/5/7 only. - Added the 5th class called Scavenger. Scavenger is all about looting the map, getting dangerously close to enemies, but trying to survive. It's 3 perks are: - Copy Coin: If you collect 50 loot items without dying, you'll duplicate all of them. Dying will halve the amount currently collected. - Pickpocket: Damaging enemies makes them drop random loot, on a 8 second cooldown. The closer you are the more loot they drop. - Static Aid: Your passive regen will recharge and heal +150% faster whenever you stand still. - Heavy's ROF increases by +3% instead of +2% per level. - Heavy's shield will now also activate when standing still. - Caster loses the Skill Lottery perk that gave you a level 1 legendary. Instead, the new skill-based vendor upgrades are +50% more powerful. - All skills have been buffed slightly, by making their level 1 version stronger. For example Vampirism used to give +4/8/12/etc healing. Now it starts at +8/12/16/etc. - USP fire rate is now 360 instead of 300 - Deagle DPS remains the same, but now has 25hp x 240 rpm instead of 20hp x 300 rpm (more impactful) - UZI bullet speed is now 85 instead of 75m/s - SPAS spread is now 20 instead of 22 - AK47 damage is now 10 instead of 11, but fire rare is 515 instead of 450 (feels better). AK47 recoil is worse. - Ruger fire rate is now 80 instead of 72 - Barrett fire rate is now 48 instead of 50 - Tasers fire rate is now 360 instead of 300 - Nailgun fire rate is now 900 instead of 720, with damage at 9 instead of 10. DPS is thus 135 instead of 120 (highest in the game!) But the clip size is only 25 instead of 30. - Seek Rifle rpm is now 400 instead of 360, bringing DPS up to 107 instead of 96 - Minigun clip size is now 50 instead of 40 - Fixed the max wanted steam achievement (for real this time)",1706279345,['patchnotes']
308600,RARE LOOT SHOOTOUTS,"Hey all, hope you had a great new years break. Just a small balance patch. FYI, these balance changes are based on feedback in Discord, but also on data collected from every player and every match. If a skill gets a higher win rate than average it might get a nerf. Same for weak skills getting buffs. Over the last year I've seen that the skills are getting close to a consistent, balanced win-rate. Yay science! The other interesting change this version is that rare loot is now visible on the minimap, and gives more XP too. It will show with a little question mark icon, giving players a new type of objective to fight over. Enjoy! bencelot ---- - The score chart now automatically displays between rounds. - Warmup rounds are a bit faster. - Changed the colour of enemies from red to slightly purplishly red. - Pressing E on regular civilians now makes them follow you. - When a zombie picks up their 4th heart piece, they will remain for another 0.5s before they revive. This gives time to pickup other loot. - Rerolling now costs $2000 for regular drafts and $5000 for boosted drafts. However, if you reroll on a boosted draft you are now guaranteed to get that same rarity after rerolling. - Rare loot crates now give an extra +100xp and show up on the minimap when they're active. - Heart fragments now give +50xp instead of +20xp for survivors. However, they no longer drop on kill for survivors. - Players now get 10 instead of 5 score per level up. - The skill point leveling curve is now 15% slower. - Our second legendary skill appears at level 12 instead of 15. - Bots are less accurate with snipers and M4A1. - Assault no longer has +20% bigger shifts, nor does it reduce combat slowdown. Instead, Assault has a new perk which makes it reload weapons +70% faster. - Sniper's bullets now have +20% range instead of +5m range (+20% works out to +10m range on normal rifles). - Heavy's health kits appear 20% instead of 15% of the time, and will pop out directly behind you if possible, also more consistently. - Caster no longer gains extra cash or XP from kills. Instead skill draft rerolls are 50% cheaper ($1000 instead of $2000, or $2500 instead of $5000 if boosted). - Self Repair takes 2.0 instead of 3.0s to heal - Illicit Income gain per wanted level is +3% instead of +2% per level - Cluster Bomb throws nades 0.1s more frequently - Force Fields bounced bullets deal 10% more damage and steer a bit faster - Blade Fury slashing damage is now 100hp/s instead of 60hp/s - Invis only does reduced damage for 0.7 instead of 1.0s - Rambulance post-vehicle healing duration is now 5s instead of 4s, and regen is +5hp/s for all levels - Shockwave cooldown is 2s faster for all levels - Medical Supplies now fires loot at you from player kills too - Vampirism healing gains 4% instead of 5% per level - Clip Magnet seeking is 2 less per level - Proximity Rounds charging range is now 30 instead of 40m - Bullet Time slows enemy bullets down to 20% instead of 16% speed, and doesn't seek as much at higher levels.",1704988721,['patchnotes']
308600,"GSA 0.70: Classes, Gun Skins & Skill Rerolls!","https://i.imgur.com/8GJY988.gif NEW CLASS SYSTEM Choose your champion! This version adds a long awaited class system. There are currently 4 classes, but more will be added next version. On the loading screen you can choose to play as Assault, Sniper, Heavy or Caster. Each class has 3 powerful perks, which creates a unique playstyle that combos best with the various skills and weapons in the game. Everyone's class icon is shown above their heads, allowing us to see what others are playing and counter them. There is a subtle rock, paper, scissors mechanic amongst the classes too. For example, the Sniper class deal extremely high damage bullets - but only at range. So charge up close to counter them! The Assault class moves extra fast and can close the gap easily, making Assault a natural counter to Sniper. However Assault is countered by Heavy, because Heavy has a shield perk that reduces all enemy bullet damage by 3, which really harms the high ROF guns that the Assault likes to use. Sniper rifles however blast right through this shield, and so Heavy is countered by Sniper. And then there's Caster doing his own thing, spamming active skills all over the place. https://i.imgur.com/5nkZP4J.png 4 NEW CLASSES These classes replace the old Perk system. The old perk system had solid perks in it, but the system itself was too confusing and static. It was too much effort to think up a new combo between matches, and so we mostly just stuck with the same old perks game after game. Classes take the best of the old perks, tweak them a bit, buff them a lot, and make it extremely convenient to change classes between matches. With a single click you can try a whole new playstyle each game! Here are the perks of the new classes. https://i.imgur.com/UbUsznA.jpg ASSAULT PERKS (Movement & Aggression) - Super Shifts: You can fire your weapon while shifting, and your shift distance is +20%. - Run & Gun: Move +15% faster. You also won't slow down as much when firing your guns. - Death Fueled: Gain +10hp/s for 10s whenever you kill an enemy player civ or cop. SNIPER PERKS (High Damage at Range) - Rifle Range: Bullets gain damage the further they travel, dealing up to +25% damage at 70m. Also gives +5m range. - Black Market: You can purchase tier 2 and 3 guns 1 round earlier. - Backup Bomb: Whenever you throw an explosive you'll throw another one for free shortly after. HEAVY PERKS (Huge DPS, but Immobile) - Crisis Cover: Enemy bullets deal -3 damage to you whenever your health goes below 50%. - Final Focus: Gain +30% rate of fire and +30% bullet speed whenever your health goes below 50%. - Beaten Heart: Gives a 15% chance to drop a +20hp health kit whenever you're hit by an enemy bullet. CASTER PERKS (Yer a Wizard Harry!) - Active Healing: Active skills have -30% cooldown time and instantly heal you +30 health when cast. - Skill Lottery: At level 1 you will see 2 Epic skills in the draft. - Flashy Finish: Gain +$500 and +50xp from each kill. This is doubled if you kill with non-bullet damage. https://i.imgur.com/CclWXAF.jpg LEVEL UP CLASSES & GET SKINS We can level up our classes too. Whenever you earn trophies at the end of the match (based on your placement) you'll make progress towards your chosen class. When you get enough trophies you can level it up, which gives you some currency but more importantly unlocks new gun skins. There are 35 new cosmetics added to the game. This includes a ""Silver"" skin for every gun, and a few ""Golden"" skins for the most popular ones. As your total class level increases you'll gain access to new skins, until every gun is shimmering in either silver or gold. Due to the camera angle, characters appear quite small in GSA, and the guns appear even smaller. To solve this, every gun skin has a huge bright glow, simulating the blue moonlight reflecting off the gun's barrel - or the ""sunlight"" if you have a golden skin. https://i.imgur.com/w3nBl9S.jpg REROLLING SKILL DRAFTS Another huge change - there is now a REROLL button in the skill draft. Whenever you level up you'll see 2 new skills. But you now have a 3rd option to spend $1000 to reroll the draft and see 2 other skills instead. You can keep clicking this until you find a skill that works with your build. This gives cash an interesting new use, and if you're trying to create the perfect skill build you might spend MOST of your cash on rerolling. But if you're more versatile and can make any skill work, then you can save your money to buy bigger guns instead. This system subtly rewards players who have mastered all the skills in the game, and are able to adapt to anything they're given. https://i.imgur.com/7pRiT2G.gif NO MORE SKILL DISABLING It is no longer possible to disable skills in the skill tree. This feature had good and bad points. The good: It was fun to be able to create a unique build by disabling skills, and it was also nice to avoid skills that you didn't like. The bad: It was a fairly tedious requirement to do this if you wanted to pla...",1703271142,
308600,Cleaner Showdowns,"Heyo, this is a small patch to make showdowns cleaner. A recent change made it a bit too easy for zombies to respawn, especially if there were a lot of skilled players in the server who knew how to move fast. This made the final showdowns a bit too chaotic and a bit of a coin flip to see who would win. So to make showdowns more clean between the final survivors, zombie respawns are harder. Killing another zombie now only drops 1 heart piece, and they no longer drop the amount they were carrying. We also require 4 instead of 3 hearts to respawn. To compensate for this, we no longer lose our hearts when we die (which was a bit frustrating anyway). Enjoy! bencelot ---- -Zombies no longer lose their heart progress when they die. But they now require 4 hearts to rez instead of 3. -Killing an enemy zombie now drops exactly 1 heart. It doesn't drop extra fragments based on how many they've collected. -Added green bubble visual feedback for all healing skills -During overtime, the poison gas deals increasing damage based on your time inside it, and this rate is now remembered until you die. -Tweaked the order we unlock boosted skills. Instead of getting a legendary on level 5, and rares/epics on 8/11/14/17. We now get our legendary at 6 and get rares/epics at 5/10/15. If you reach level 20 you'll get a second legendary. -Whenever we see a brand new legendary or epic in the draft, we only get 1 draft option (in the next major version, we'll be able to unlock boosters that let us control these) -Fixed a bug where you couldn't reload if you have only fired a single shot of your gun -Your existing skills now show when you are offered new skills - Map spawns 18 instead of 20 vendors - Flare gun now deals 10hp flame damage for 1s -Added 3s extra to the end of each round to collect loot -Radiate impact radius is 20m instead of 16m -Stimpacks can no longer heal you in the poison gas -Flying Dagger now works for zombies. -Flying dagger damage now ranges from 70% to 100% instead of 105% to 135% -Force Fields burst damage is now 30 instead of 20 -Clip Magnet now shows a green seeking halo when you have available bullets",1699908066,['patchnotes']
308600,Power spikes create key milestones juust before round showdowns (with good farm),"This patch tweaks the cash and XP rates to make farming more meaningful, and adds key milestones to aim for just before the rounds 1, 2 and 3 showdowns. Firstly, we all earn a lot more cash and XP. Tier 2 and tier 3 weapons are also $5000 cheaper, so we'll all be more powerful by the final showdown. Also, skills now level up at fixed, predictable levels. We get new skills at levels 1/2/5/8/11/14. If you farm well, you can reach level 5 just before the round 1 showdown. This is important because level 5 now always gives you a LEGENDARY boosted skill, which starts at level 4 and can reach a super OP level 7. Levels 8, 11 and 14 will give everyone EPIC or RARE skills, which also give bonus points and provide key milestones right before the round 2 and 3 showdowns. Enjoy! bencelot ---- - We now always see brand new skills at levels 1 and 2. Then 3 and 4 upgrade them. Then we get boosted skills on level 5/8/11/14/17. - Normal skills can now go up to level 4 instead of level 3. - Boosted skills now come in 3 rarites: Rare, Epic and Legendary. - Legendary skills always appear at level 5. They start at level 4 and go up to level 7. - Epic skills can appear at levels 8, 11, 14 and 17. They start at level 3 and go up to level 6. - Rare skills also appear at levels 8, 11, 14 and 17. They start at level 2 and go up to level 5. - Getting 5 streak points now gives you a flat +500xp, instead of a free level up. - The Kill Reward now gains xp and cash 33% faster. - Supply Drops give an extra +100xp, +$1000 and +3% weapon damage. - Cops give 11/12/13/14/15xp based on your wanted level instead of a flat 10. - Tier2 weapons cost $5000 instead of $10,000 (but are still only available on round 2) - Superweapons cost $15k instead of $25k ($10k instead of $15k to upgrade from your tier 2 gun) - Cops have 50 instead of 40hp health and do 100% instead of 80% damage. - 3 supply drops instead of 1 spawn at the start of a BR match - Supply drops gain armor for each player nearby, shown by an expanding health bar. - Civilians now eject from cars faster, immediately as soon as it starts flaming - Shotguns now deal more damage but have worse range and spread - Updated the default control scheme a bit (for new players). Interacting with HUD is now CTRL, placing chems is now C, slashing knife is now middle mouse - All players, now including F2P people, will show off their account level when they win a round - Your Streak point progress is shown below your health bar. -Radiate cooldown is now 18/17/16/15/14/13/12 instead of fixed at 16s.

308600,"GSA 0.67: Critical Rage, Boosted Skills & 13 New Passives!","https://i.imgur.com/wojvz1e.gif CRITICAL RAGE May the best reflexes win. GSA now has a new and extremely OP mechanic called Critical Rage. Whenever you shoot an enemy you have a 3% chance to go crazy and start firing critical bullets. These bullets deal DOUBLE DAMAGE and for the next 2 seconds you will obliterate anything in front of you, so make those bullets count! Why was this added? Because it is just pure dopamine fun and feels incredible when it randomly kicks in. Now, you might think this is some OP RNG BS... and that's what people said in playtesting too! But we fixed that with a very visible 1 second warning animation before you enter this state. If your opponents have good reflexes this is more than enough time for them to shift to safety and wait out your 2 seconds of fury. Of course, we all get these equally, and ultimately the players with the better reflexes win - either shifting to safety or pushing their advantage and landing those sweet, sweeeet crit hits. https://i.imgur.com/STyKtSm.jpg LEVEL SIX BOOSTED SKILLS The skill draft now contains BOOSTED skills. Boosted skills randomly appear in your skill draft and they appear in the most special colour of all - rainbow. Boosted skills give you free skill points when you level them up. The later into the game it is, the more free points you get. If they appear on level 2 they'll give just +1 free point. Not bad. But if this occurs at level 11 then you'll get +4 points instead! This keeps farming relevant right until the end of the match, as every last level might boost you to victory. More importantly however, boosted skills can go all the way up to level SIX, whereas normal skills are capped at level 3. Investing this many skill points into a single skill makes it extremely powerful, and it's been good fun playtesting them all to see how broken they get. You don't have to invest this many points of course, as you have other skills to level as well. But you have the option to take your boosted skill to the max and adapt the rest of your build to support it. Now, hang on a second.. more OP RNG??? Not quite, because everyone gets boosted skills at the same levels. At the start of the match the server will decide which levels will be boosted, and all players get their boost option at the same time. Usually there are just 1 or 2 boosted skills per game.. but very rarely there can be 5 or even 6. For everyone. These rare matches are wild where everyone is extremely OP, potentially with 2x the amount of skill points as we'd normally get. High stakes indeed! https://i.imgur.com/v7wOU2y.gif 13 BRAND NEW SKILLS This version adds 13 new skills. Some of these have been automatically added to your account, others are further out in the skill tree and need to be unlocked. All of these skills are passives, which is what most people seem to prefer, and the extra options really make drafting interesting. A few of these skills were inspired by Vampire Survivors, for example ""Revenge Rockets"" which spins bazookas around you and automatically fires them at enemies whenever you get hit. https://i.imgur.com/B0CYJ4s.png Revenge Rockets: 1/2/3/4/5/6 bazookas spin around you and automatically fire back at enemies whenever they shoot you. Beefcake: Gain +10/20/30/40/50/60 max hp. Executioner: Deal +10/20/30/40/50/60% damage against enemies with less than 50% health remaining. Stimpacks: Restore +4/8/12/16/20/24 hp per shift. Critical Rage: Increases the chance of entering critical rage by +33/67/100/133/167/200%. Shift Supply: Gives +1/2/3/4/5/6 bonus shift charges. Combo Killer: Increases the time you get between multi-kills from 3s to 4.5/6.0/7.5/9.0/10.5/12.0. Falling Inferno: Throws a free molotov whenever you cast a skill for 25/50/75/100/125/150% damage. Medical Supplies: All forms of loot heal you by 5/10/15/20/25/30 hp. Crates throw loot towards you. Flying Dagger: You can throw your knife 10/20/30/40/50/60 meters and for extra damage. Rambulance: Your vehicles drive faster, do more ramming damage, and heal you by 10/20/30/40/50/60 hp/s. Armed Robbery: Killing vendors has a chance to drop rare loot. XP, hearts and upgrades. Chance of upgrade is 5/10/15/20/25/30%. Acid Trail: You leave a trail of acid behind you that deals 10/20/30/40/50/60 hp/s damage to enemies inside it. https://i.imgur.com/uRSd9aE.png TROPHY CHALLENGE To help you earn the coins to unlock some of these new skills, there is a new system called Trophy Challenge. All 54 skills in the game have their own challenge, which is to finish a match with at least 6 trophies while using the skill. This can only be attempted for one skill at a time, which is determined by whatever skill you choose to guarantee shows up at the start of the match. This system does a few things. If you don't feel like playing ranked mode but still want to have a meaningful goal to achieve, you can attempt a new trophy challenge.

308600,GSA 0.650: The Roguelitification of Skill Drafts,"Hey all! This version tweaks skill drafting to make GSA play more like a roguelite. The goal is to reduce repetitive matches by reducing the control we have over our builds. For example, the guaranteed skill now only appears in 33% of matches. This affects all players equally, and still lets us choose and use our favourite - but not every game. Most games we need to adapt to the draft and piece together a smart build as we play, which raises the skill ceiling. Speaking of skill ceilings, it just got even higher! This is because in ranked mode rounds 1 and 2 now give +1 trophy each. This means that if you manage to win all 3 rounds you can get 12 trophies instead of 10, letting skillful players climb the ranks extra fast. Next version will rework the perks system into a classes system, making it far easier to switch playstyles between games. Enjoy! ---- --- GENERAL CHANGES --- - Added a reconnect button. This appears above the play button in purple, and lets you rejoin the last server you were in (useful if you d/c). - If you leave a duos/squads server mid-game and rejoin, the server will try and put you back onto the old squad. - Improved visual feedback whenever you hit an enemy by making their outline briefly flash white. --- GAMEPLAY CHANGES --- - The draft now only shows 2 skill options instead of 3. - The guaranteed skill now only appears in 33% of matches. - When you get a bonus skill point, this now jumps from level 0 to 2 instead of 1 to 3. - All skill values have been rescaled slightly, so that levels 1 and 2 are a bit weaker, 3 is the same, and 4 is extra powerful. - Level 4 skills now appear at levels 7/10/13/16/etc. - Skill builds now require 15 skills instead of 12 (5 actives and 10 passives). If you had existing builds below 15, ring 1 skills will be automatically added to them (but you can change them of course). - The victors of rounds 1 and 2 get +1 trophy instead of bonus health.

308600,GSA 0.646: A simple balancing,"MINOR TWEAKS August 7th, 2023 Heyo, nothing too crazy this patch. The main change is buffing the TTK of some weapons, and repositioning the game info box to the top left of the screen. Enjoy! ---- --- GENERAL CHANGES --- - Repositioned the game mode info HUD element to now appear up the top left of the screen - Players can now only have 1 account on their SteamID (this won't affect 99% of players, but fixes an exploit) - When someone wins a round, the DLC medallion now only shows for people who own the DLC - Tutorial improvements --- WEAPON CHANGES --- - Buffed AK rpm from 400 to 450 - Buffed Ruger damage from 35 to 40, but reduced rpm from 90 to 80. - SMGs and LMGs have slightly faster bullet speed. --- SKILL CHANGES --- - Firestorm projectiles are closer together, but fly a bit slower through the air - Blade Fury blades now burst out after 1s instead of 1.5s --- BUG FIXES --- - Fixed a bug where the final 6 scoreboard would keep showing ranks even when people were playing casual mode",1691387199,['patchnotes']
308600,"GSA 0.64: GET RANKED. Win games, earn trophies, and climb the ranks!","https://i.imgur.com/pXIsqhB.gif GET RANKED MMR is everything. GSA now has a ranked mode, and as a competitive gamer I am pumped! Gene Shift Auto now finally provides a true challenge, and this gives meaning to every single mechanic in the game. Sure, before you could ""beat"" the game and win a match.. but could you do it consistently? Can you do it with the highest win rate possible? Ranked mode now provides this challenge and lets us put our skills to the test. https://i.imgur.com/TSNxqxi.jpg Earning Trophies The quest for the Holy Grail begins. When you load into a match, you can choose between Casual or Ranked mode. If you select ranked mode you'll be able to earn Trophies. Trophies are awarded at the end of the match based on your score. First place gets 10 trophies, second place gets 8, third gets 6, and so on. After 5 placement matches you will be given a rating and a corresponding rank. Your rating is based on your AVERAGE TROPHIES PER MATCH. This means that if you place poorly in a game (or quit early) your rating will go down. This makes rating an actual measure of skill, rather than who has played the longest. Having said that, someone who consistently averages 1st or 2nd place over 100 games is probably better than someone who by chance happens to win 1 match. So our ratings initially start a bit lower and will approach towards our true average as we demonstrate our ability to win games CONSISTENTLY. https://i.imgur.com/3y0SNG5.gif Monthly Leaderboards The rating system is tied to the monthly leaderboards, where players can climb the ranks and see who can get the highest rating each month. When a new month starts, the previous month will be archived and winners will be immortalized in the previous month's leaderboards page. Also, at the start of each month, everyone's rating will have a soft reset and be partially reduced. This soft reset allows new players to have a chance at the top spot, and also ensures that our ranks are up to date and reflect our skills in the current meta. https://i.imgur.com/yKwzYTh.png Climbing the Ranks Of course, the most important part of any ranking system is showing off. As your rating improves, so too will your rank. When your rating crosses over the next threshold you will get a new rank title and badge. Whenever you play a ranked match (not casual), this badge will show next to your name in the in-game scoreboards, letting everyone know who the real danger is. https://media.tenor.com/Df6gS4OdVpgAAAAC/i-am-the-danger.gif As a final cool benefit, the game is now using the ranking technology to secretly determine player's skills behind the scenes, even when ranked mode is disabled. These hidden ratings will be useful to ensure balanced squads and potentially match making in the future. https://i.imgur.com/3YeT5Yl.png Other Groovy Changes Ranked mode is the big new feature that just dropped, but here are a few other smaller changes that have been released since the last major Steam announcement. Stronger GTA Focus: There are new civilian missions, and a sense of exploration as you use vehicles to find them. We can also climb wanted levels much faster for those going a PvE farming strategy (is PvE the best way to win games? With ranks we can now find out!) More Risk & Reward Mechanics: You now get bonus XP and cash for killing players during overtime, but this is the riskiest time to hunt for kills as if you die you can't revive. Likewise, supply drops have been buffed, but they now land just before overtime, increasing the risk. Faster Gameplay: The game is just faster and crisper now. We move faster, especially during combat. This requires more skill to aim and lead targets. The TTK is also faster, and weapons are more differentiated. More Features for F2P Players: Players without the DLC can now attempt 24 instead of 10 challenges from the challenge grid. Also, the ability to co-op with friends in survival mode is no longer restricted. Hardcore survival mode is also avaiable to F2P players. Extra Powerful Lvl 4 Skills: It is now harder to take a skill up to max level of 4, but if you do it will extra powerful, as the 4th skill point is now worth double (as if it was level 5). You must get 10 skill points before you can take a skill up to max level though, so get farming! Skill Balancing: With ranked mode, I needed to make sure the skills were ACTUALLY balanced, based on cold hard data. So I added a new stats tracking system to check the win rates and kill rates of each individual skill. It turned out that the passive weapon skills were mega OP, and many actives were underperforming (as they require more skill to use). So I've done the buffs and now the tricksy interesting skills are competitive. There are a lot of other changes, small quality of life fixes, better graphics, more visceral level up and kill effects etc. There's too much to list but it's all available in the in-game changelogs. https://i.imgur.com/G9Z9ZbQ.gif Next Steps Next version I will continue exp...",1689933104,

308600,GSA 0.61: Fight under neon lights to adrenaline pumping cyberpunk beats!,"https://i.imgur.com/AN7MMHq.gif Fight to the Beats in the Cyberpunk Streets Oh. My. Gawd. Becky. Look at that - Cyberpunk aesthetic! It's so.. neon! GSA has gone full Cyberpunk with a visual overhaul to the map and many effects in game. The map is now set in a dark, raining city lit by futuristic pink and blue neon lights. Your shifts and bullets have been recoloured to fit the look too, and when you kill enemies they will cover your screen in a big burst of neon blood. Best of all, the map will visually pulse to the beat of the new cyberpunk tunes! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/effdc3ed19486a448ccecf982a8dd6d52c3c72a0.jpg New Trailer The trailer has been updated with one of the new musical tracks and some new footage. Check it out! 12 New Cyberpunky/Synthwavey Tunes Gene Shift Auto now has professionally made music! The old music was made entirely by me, and it was.. you know, not bad. A bit of a catchy tune here and there? But I'm not a musician, and it's just not the same. These new tracks sound way better and really get the adrenaline pumping. And this makes a huge difference. After all, what is the point of GSA if not to inject a high-stakes rush of BR fueled dopamine right into your eyes and earballs? These tunes take that rush to the next level. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/1d489f26fb39d89b51873281438bfd8571bc36b1.jpg Dynamically Synced To the Action What's especially cool is how the music syncs with the action in the game. The music will only play during overtime of each round, to indicate that the stakes have changed and you need to focus. As a refresher on how GSA plays, each match lasts 15 minutes, consisting of 3, 5 minute rounds. The winner of round 3 wins the game. And each round has 2 stages within it: Looting Stage (3 minutes): You can revive easily, so stakes are low. Mess around, fight cops, do missions, just enjoy some GTA vibes. Overtime (2 minutes): In overtime you can't revive anymore, so death is final. This massively raises the stakes, and is the BR part of the game. This is when the music kicks in, it's last man standing, and this helps remind you that the stakes are high and you need to survive! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/3afe6aa3642c7857d869ff42f1fcde4fd6b4614d.jpg The genre also changes based on what round you're in, gradually getting more and more intense. Round 1: Groovy Retro/Synthwave Vibes. Fun and melodic. Round 2: Actiony Cyberpunk vibes. Loud, industrial, and with a heavy beat. Round 3 (the final showdown): Dramatic/Epic/Dark Hans Zimmer just got cut off in traffic vibes. Also, the volume of the music will change based on how well you're playing, getting louder and louder the longer you stay alive, to really amp up the adrenaline. Many elements in the game are visually synchronised to this beat as well, like police sirens will flash red/blue to the beat. Just for funsies. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/ea7a41b93954f0454851fd9b3040f3d8453a07eb.png Improving the Perks System There are a few big changes to improve the perks system that came out last month. 1: Perks no longer cost kill coins to unlock. Anyone who bought perks has been refunded those coins. 2: You can now equip 2 perks instead of 1, allowing you to create more interesting builds between games. 3: At the start of each match, all players are given a 3rd bonus perk. This is randomly chosen from all the perks in the game, even the ones you haven't earned yet. Most interestingly, ALL players are given the SAME random perk. Which makes each game feel really different. In one match we all might get the +20 max hp perk (Genetic Heart), making it a slower, more tanky game. In the next we all might get the ability to throw 2x grenades. Knowing what your opponents have is something you'll want to adapt to while drafting your skill build in-game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/6567b7c2eba58b156d30d1d959a70024e1e2d212.jpg New Play vs Bots Option GSA is a complicated game, and it can be a bit overwhelming for new players. But now you can fire up a quick game vs bots to learn, practice or experiment with that shiny new perk you unlocked. And no longer need to figure things out in the competitive heat of the PvP servers online. The bots are pretty easy as well, so if you just want a chill game to feel like a badass this is a nice option. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/56691c1acf291a77402a677b758e9077a3ee9956.jpg Next Steps Next version I'll be adding a new cosmetics system, to allow players to customize their appearance with some fancy outfits and bling bling. Some cosmetics will be available for purchase with kill coins for free, and others exclusively purchased with a premium currency for people who want to support the game. The ability to customise our characters has been requested for a long time now, and I'm excited to create some really sick (perhaps cyberpunky) looking outfits, taunts and special effects. Of course this will be purely cosmetic, and not affect gameplay in any way. Anyway will post more soon once I know more detail...",1683856982,

308600,GSA 0.60: New Perks system with 36 brand new abilities!,"https://i.imgur.com/q2ZtXU7.png A Whole New World (of Perks) What is a perk? Perks are powerful passive buffs that last all game. They are a bit like skills, but instead of leveling them up, you will be given 2 perks at the start of each match automatically. There are 36 perks in total, spread across the 6 skill trees, and they do all sorts of things. Here are a few examples: Genetic Heart (Healing Tree): Gain +20 max hitpoints. Evasive Shot (Defense Tree): You can fire your weapons while shifting. Heat Seeking (Weaponry Tree): Your bullets will steer towards enemies. Boom Box (Burst Damage Tree): Crates have a 30% chance to give you a free grenade. Skill Lottery (DOT Tree): Start each match with a free level 3 skill. Outlaw (Utility Tree): You will never lose your wanted level, even when you die. https://i.imgur.com/0I2UCFl.png Unlocking Perks With Medals There are 6 perks per skill tree, and to unlock the higher tier perks in that tree you first need a certain number of skill medals. To get skill medals you need to use the skills within that tree, and level up their individual medals by completing skill-specific challenges. https://i.imgur.com/X8WD0GF.png This screenshot should make it clearer. Here we are looking at the perks in the Defense Tree. I have unlocked 3 perks in this tree already, but in order to unlock the 4th (Driveby) I first need to earn 30 medals within the Defense tree. I currently only have 14, but I can choose to use the Defense skills while playing to earn medals faster. This system exists for 2 reasons: 1) It makes build creation far more interesting, as you now rewarded for embracing a particular skill tree to unlock the perks that best suit your custom playstyle. 2) It encourages you to try new skills, as you will earn medals faster at the earlier levels, and thus the best way to get medals is to try new skills within your tree of choice. https://i.imgur.com/Gh7NAM2.png 6 Brand New Skills In addition to the 36 entirely brand new perks, the skill tree itself has been rearranged. All of the add-on skills have been removed and rolled into their base skills (eg, Plasma Ball now automatically shoots out multiple balls like Fire Storm used to do). And instead, we get 6 brand new passive skills! - SHRAPNEL: ""Grenades and other explosives deal more damage, and molotov's burn for longer."" - FLAMING BULLETS: ""Your bullets set enemies on fire, dealing damage and delaying their passive regen."" - BOOTS OF TRAVEL: ""Makes you run faster whenever you aren't firing your gun"" - BLADE MAIL: ""Protects you while you reload, and protects more based on how empty your clip was. After reloading, your next bullet deals bonus damage equal to the damage blocked."" - SKILL SHOTS: ""Increases all forms of non-bullet damage (skills, grenades, cars, knife, etc). If you get a non-bullet kill, you'll gain a charge that gives extra damage. Charges reset on death."" - ASSASSINATE: ""A random enemy will be revealed to you in the map, and you will deal bonus damage against them. If you kill them you'll earn extra cash and XP, then get a new target."" {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/82c86ae01ba2a77e22bc08006969209e3d53b3bc.png Faster, Snappier Round Format Gameplay has been improved in countless other ways, but here are the 3 biggest changes to the BR formula: 1) Rounds only last 3 minutes instead of 5 minutes: With 3 rounds and overtime this gives a snappy 14 minute match instead of 20 minutes. It's not just faster, but the gameplay is more chaotic, more intense, and every second counts. 2) Skill points are rarer, but more powerful: Instead of reaching level 18, a good player should reach level 10. But we'll be just as powerful now due to all the extra +2 skill point bonuses you get in the draft. This focuses on quality over quantity, and lets us spend more time shooting and less time clicking skills. 3) Players can revive after overtime: A special heart crate will fall down 1 minute after overtime, to give all the zombies in the server 1 last opportunity to revive. But only 1 person can get the heart, so you better prepare! This keeps players always active and always with a sense of hope to win right up until the very last second. That's it for this version, as always please leave feedback either here or on Discord. Enjoy! https://i.imgur.com/tkfuLui.jpg Big Old Changelist --- NEW PERKS SYSTEM --- - Added a whole new perks system! - Perks are passive buffs that you select before the match begins. EG: +20 max hitpoints, +10% bullet damage, or cheaper weapons from vendors. - There are 36 perks in total, and they are organised into the 6 skill trees. So there are 6 Healing perks, 6 Defense perks, etc. - You can enable 1 perk per skill tree, which creates a pool of 6 perks. Then when the game begins, 2 of those perks will be randomly selected and given to you for free. - To unlock new perks you must first collect a certain number of SKILL MEDALS within that skill tree. And you get skill medals by using skills within that tree. - A...",1680886802,
308600,Version 0.517: Reworking Shifts for Cleaner Fights & Smoother Movement,"Hey all! This version reworks shifting to make fights cleaner and movement smoother. There are two big changes: 1) You can no longer fire your gun while shifting (cleaner fights) 2) We get shift charges far more often (smoother movement) Previously, players could shoot and shift at the same time. And good players realised that you could spam shifts every fight and be almost impossible to hit. This made fights quite messy. But now, players must make a tactical choice of when to shoot and when to shift, and use shifts to reposition themselves next to cover before they attack. Another upside is we can all have way more shifts, as there is no risk of people spamming them during fights anymore. So movement in general is a lot faster, and no longer needs annoying penalties to discourage shifting in combat either. So shift as much as you like! (Just do it smart while in combat). Other highlights this version are a new warmup mode (with random skills instead of guns), new zombie betting (where you can bet multiple times per round), and we no longer lose our Kill Reward cash when we die. As always feedback on Steam or Discord is welcome. Enjoy! ---- --- SHIFTING REWORK --- - You can no longer shoot while shifting (skills still work though) - Players take 20% less damage while shifting - Shift charges restore faster (every 0.8s), and don't recharge slower in combat - Shift charges no longer get smaller if you use too many of them or during combat --- GAMEPLAY CHANGES --- - Dying no longer loses your kill reward.

308600,"0.51: Unlimited Ammo, SWAT Van, & Double XP Week!","https://i.imgur.com/V9dLySZ.png 2X XP Week & 30% DLC Discount Hey all! To celebrate the new version, this week everyone will earn 2X XP. The Deluxe Edition will also be 30% off if you're interested! https://store.steampowered.com/app/2194030/Gene_Shift_Auto_Deluxe_Edition/ Streamlined Combat Since going F2P it has become very clear - Gene Shift Auto is complicated! Over the years many mechanics have been added, and in hindsight not all of them provided enough gameplay depth to justify their complexity. There was just a bit too much going on. Gene Shift Auto should be easy to learn and hard to master, and that's what this version hopes to achieve. So a number of mechanics have been removed this version (from PvP, they still exist in Survival mode). We no longer need to worry about backup lives, nor do we have to grind missions non-stop without a moments rest. Critical boolets were neat but didn't really add enough so they're gone too. Only mechanics that really ADD something to gameplay remain. But by far the biggest change of all is... https://i.imgur.com/Yrklvvp.png Infinite Ammo! Guns have unlimited ammo now. You no longer need to rebuy ammo, and you'll never run out mid-combat. To compensate reload times have been increased and cash drop rates are less as we'll no longer be spending cash throughout the game. Vendors no longer need to sell ammo, and so they have a much needed extra weapon slot instead. Ammo management is a great mechanic in simpler games, but in GSA we have far more important things to worry about, such as... https://i.imgur.com/PE0zl5X.png SWAT Vans! The cops are more dangerous now with SWAT vans. These kick in at wanted level 3 (special forces kick in at wanted level 4). The Van is tough with a bunch of hitpoints, so you can't just blow it up before it arrives. Each van will charge you down and pop out 4 cops at the last minute. You could say that these police are actually FASHION police, because we now have... https://i.imgur.com/1NXL71W.png Exclusive Cosmetics The cosmetics page has been reworked and a bunch of new cosmetics have been added for those who own the Deluxe Edition. A nice way to show off your support for the game. Some big ones are: - Ability to change your shirt color - Ability to change your bullet trails - Rainbow effect when you shift https://i.imgur.com/MR8wjGT.png New Skills A few new skills have been added too. Last version saw the addition of Hypnotic Army, which allows you to hypnotise nearby cops and civilians to become your minions. Now we have a new skill called Clip Magnet, which makes your bullets seek towards enemies based on how many crates you've recently opened. It also makes the crates you destroy shoot their loot towards you, so you can YOINK a supply drop from across the screen! https://i.imgur.com/Vxor2jf.png A Huge Amount of Polish Most of this version is just polish. Polish polish polish! There have been tens of thousands of new players join since going F2P and hundreds of lessons learned from observing them. The changelog below has the details but some fun highlights are: Civs now run away from gunfire; the ability to refund your weapon for 100% of its initial purchase value; Sonar Cells reworked so when you stand inside it you get global map vision; QoL improvements, skill balancing, bug fixes and more! https://i.imgur.com/YNAO9rF.png Next Version Now that F2P is done, and this version has polished up (most of) the issues found by the new F2P audience, I will be free to actually do some solid dev again! And I'm very excited about the next major feature, which will be turning the city into a giant GTA-style playground. The city right now is too plain. There aren't enough land marks and there aren't any ways to interact with the map. This is what I want to change. Lets add a police station to farm cops at, a hospital to respawn at, hidden rooms to explore, fun parkor puzzles and turbo boosters everywhere. Super fast moving jump pads that launch you directly into giant spinning blades of death. Should be fun. Anyway enjoy the version! Ben. https://i.imgur.com/6gurUsh.gif Big Old Changelist --- MAJOR GAMEPLAY CHANGES --- - All weapons now have INFINITE AMMO (you still need to reload, but never rebuy). - Removed critical bullets from the game. - The concept of backup lives has been removed from PvP game modes. When a survivor collects a heart they get $200 instead. - You can only do 3 missions per game, one unlocking per round, and missions are no longer shared with allies. --- DLC CHANGES (STUFF FREE PLAYERS NOW GET ACCESS TO) --- - All players can now equip a skill to appear at level 1, which was previously a DLC exclusive. Skill builds are more fair this way. - All players now get access to all 4 daily challenges instead of just 2, allowing for 500 coins per day (instead of 250). - Free players can now play survival mode once per day instead of once per week (DLC is of course still unlimited). - All players can now earn kill coins based on their pl...",1676310918,
308600,Gene Shift Auto is now ACTUALLY Free-to-Play!,"The Steam Page is Fixed! Valve has fixed the issue and the play button now works. I want to apologise to the thousands of people who visited the store page yesterday. This was a very unusual bug and confused a lot of players. A lot of people messaged me thinking that their country or region had been locked out, or wondering if they personally did something wrong. But nope, it was an issue on Valve's end that affected everyone. On a personal level that was a stressful 30 hours! There was a huge spike in store page visits yesterday, over 120,000 people, but not a single download. Bit of a rough start, but all good. Anyway I'm going to copy paste the previous Steam announcement now, as this one will become the default message, and people need to know what will happen to their accounts.

308600,"1.49: New name, new trailer and in 2 weeks we go Free-to-Play!","https://i.imgur.com/6gurUsh.gif Going Free to Play After 5 years in Early Access, Geneshift (now called Gene Shift Auto) is going Free to Play! This will happen on the 28th of November, 2022 (in about 2 weeks). This move to F2P will bring far more players into our community. We will have fuller servers, more members in the discord, and you can invite your friends to play for free! What will happen to you? Well, there are 2 main groups of players right now - those who own the Deluxe Edition and those who do not. Anyone who has ever spent real money on the game already owns the Deluxe Edition, and will continue to own it after we go F2P, which will still be valued at $15 USD. Anyone who got the game for free during a giveaway in the past will continue to be able to play for free. Additionally, to thank everyone for playing during this early phase, you will be given an exclusive cosmetic not available to accounts created after we go F2P. Also +2000 kill coins will be instantly added to your account on the F2P date. Make sure to follow and wishlist the game to get a reminder from Steam in 2 weeks! https://i.imgur.com/zQ2qylN.jpg New Name & New Trailer As you may have noticed, Geneshift is now called Gene Shift Auto. This is to help rebrand the game for the new F2P experience. The name has changed because the game *itself* has changed so much over the years. ""Geneshift"" was released as a story-based campaign. It didn't have cops, missions, the megamap, skill drafting, vendors or even the BR game mode! We're playing a completely different game, more of a sequel really, and a new name will help communicate to all the old fans just how much has changed. Alongside the name change, we also have a sick new trailer. Check it out here! Other Cool Features Several neat features have been patched out to the game over the last 2 months, but they haven't been discussed here on Steam yet. So I'll summarise each of them now! Kill Contracts The way we earn cash and XP has been replaced with a new Kill Contract system. All players now have a ""Kill Contract"" which is displayed under the minimap, and shows how much XP and cash you will earn on your next kill. This number ticks up over time, capping out at $3000 after a few minutes. When you kill your next victim, you are awarded the amount of accumulated cash and XP, and then the contract resets to $0. If you die the contract also resets to $0. This change has plenty of benefits. First of all, it creates moments of high tension when you go for too long without getting a kill. The contract gets bigger and bigger and the stakes grow as well, and it feels super satisfying to secure that kill and redeem the contract. Also, it fundamentally changes the pacing of the game. Under the old system, we were incentivized to grind kills non-stop to farm XP and cash as fast as possible. But kill contracts change that. You will now passively earn your XP and cash regardless, and as long as you successfully claim the contract (get a kill and don't die) you'll earn farm just as fast as anyone else. This frees you up to do all the other things in the game, like missions, shopping, placing chemicals, exploring for loot etc. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/2c2312f591af51a85611cb3fab1f217174f219a0.png Better Skill Drafting Skill drafting has been improved in various ways. Firstly, our max health is now tied to your level. You get +5 max hp whenever you level up, and random health kits have been removed from the game. This reduces RNG from looting, makes leveling up more significant, and creates better overall pacing. Secondly, the skill draft is made a lot more interesting with BONUS skill points. At key milestones you will be offered a super-charged skill that comes with bonus free skill points. For example when you hit level 5 you might be offered a choice of Plasma Ball, Force Field, or Invisibility (+2 points). And if you take Invisibility, you'll level it by 2 skill points instead of 1 - effectively giving you an extra level if and only if you choose Invis. This expands the roguelikeyness of the game as you are now incentivized to experiment with various skills you might not normally have taken. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/e22be568170e23d66ed1907c110c146373296f1d.png Bigger Cop Wave Dynamics Police waves are now bigger and badder, but less frequent. I was finding them a bit too grindy before. Now they will only swarm after you every 90s or so, but when they do they come in hard. More explosions, more XP, but then more downtime to focus on the rest of the game without being swamped. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/011a62acb2732ae9bf0dcc1612467f0cf074769c.png PVP Hardcore Mode In preparation for all the newbies arriving after F2P, a new ""Hardcore Mode"" has been added to PvP. This is optional, but if you enable this mode you will deal 25% less damage to new accounts under level 20. This will help them compete and have a chance. In exchange for your sacrifice, you'll earn +50% XP at the end of the match and...",1668482700,
308600,"1.47: Kill Streaks, Customizable Difficulty Mods, & New Win Condition!","https://i.imgur.com/Pxg7auJ.png Kill Streaks This version raises the stakes by adding kill streaks! If you kill 4 players in a row without dying, the server will announce to everyone that you are, as they say.. ""owning"". It sounds much cooler in game. At 6 kills you are wicked sick, 8 kills unstoppable, 10 kills on a m-m-m-monster kill and 12 kills you are GODLIKE! Additionally on each of these stages you will be rewarded with a randomly generated buff, that lasts until you die. Here is the full list of perks you can randomly get when you hit a kill streak milestone: +1000 cash +100 xp ammo & hp restored +20% skill damage +10% gun damage +15% bullet speed -30% recoil -35% shift cooldown -35% chemical cooldown +50% regen rate 200% civ/cop XP vendor discounts extra jump height 20 global map vision bigger car explosions Finally, the amount of cash and XP you earn now increases with your streak as well. All of this makes you really not want to die and raises the stakes in combat. It also affects how you farm, as the previous strategy of ""charge blindly into battle chasing kills"" now pays out less than the new strategy of ""selectively engage in fights you know you can win, and stay alive at all costs. This is very important because of another major change this version... https://i.imgur.com/dAVhHVs.png New Victory Condition The rules for winning have changed. Previously you needed to reach 100 score and then win the following round. There were 2 issues with this. Firstly, it was confusing. Secondly is that if your score was very far behind, you would feel a bit hopeless, like you could never catch up. But that's all fixed now. Now, to win the game all you need to do is this - win round 4. It doesn't matter what your score is. You can mess about in a casual GTA-style way in the first 3 rounds and still have a chance at victory. Everyone now has hope of winning right up until the final showdown, and players in the lead must stay on their toes or else they'll have their victory snatched from them. The core focus of the game therefore has now changed. The point of the first 3 rounds now is to get as FARMED as you can, with as much cash and XP as possible. When you start round 4 you want to be an OP juggernaut with the highest chances of winning possible. And how to get you get farmed fast? Kill streaks. Focusing on quality engagments and putting your skills to the test. https://i.imgur.com/vsMDSsm.jpg Survival Replayability with Difficulty Modifiers Survival Mode has gained a huge amount of replayabilty with the addition of Difficulty Modifers. When you start a survival run you can enable 1 or more modifiers, which will make the game more challenging in various ways. If you manage to win the game with a modifier enabled, you will complete it, like a challenge. And you will also gain bonus score, XP and kill coins. There are 18 modifiers at the moment and they are designed to get you to play in various ways. Some are much harder than others, and give bonus score and XP to compensate. Here are some example: Minefield: Covers the map in hidden Fission Mines that will detonate shortly after you step on them (protip: use a car). Super Swarm: Spawns 3x as many zombies in the zombie phase (protip: get some AoE skills). Spellcaster: Your weapons deal -25% damage, but skills +50% damage (protip: get Plasma Ball). Explosive Retaliation: When you kill an enemy, they will toss a final nade at you (protip: have some shifts saved up to dodge it). https://i.imgur.com/bgJHP3h.png Other Fun Changes This version improves the graphics with bigger car and player explosions. It also improves performance and netcode stability too. Skills and weapons have been rebalanced. The economy of cash and XP is far steadier - providing more interesting decision making opportunities. There's a new skill called Arcane power, which makes your next shot extra powerful immediately after casting a skill. In survival mode, there is a new sandbox stage after the zombie swarm. This stage lets you free-roam the map with no time pressure, fighting cops in true GTA style. There is also a new staging area before the game starts so all co-op players can ready up before starting. Scoring for the leaderboard has also been streamlined, and is now a measure of who can survive with the most difficulty modifers enabled. Read the changelog for the full list! https://i.imgur.com/TynX4FQ.png Free to Play Update We're getting closer to going F2P. It's looking like early December, but I'll make an official announcement once Valve confirms. I'm very excited to see our playerbase grow! Reminder: Anyone who has already bought the game, or buys the game now, will be given the Deluxe Edition DLC, which is the same price as the game at the moment. So whether you buy now or after going F2P doesn't really matter.

308600,"1.45: Customizable Skill Builds, Conquest Mode, & New Dynamic Music!","https://i.imgur.com/taMYKpH.jpg Customizeable Skill Builds Have you ever played Magic: The Gathering? Well my favourite part of the game isn't playing the game, but rather designing my deck. And now you can do that with the skills in Geneshift! This version gives you the ability to create and save skill builds. You can now disable skills from appearing in-game, giving you control over the skill draft. This has huge strategic potential as you can choose to only enable skills that synergize well together, and disable the rest. For example, you might choose to only enable long-ranged skills and create a sniper build. Then in-game you won't have close-range skills appear and diluting the skill draft. There are countless skill combinations to explore, and designing a synergistic build might make the difference between victory or defeat. After designing your build you can easily give it a name and save it. You can have multiple custom-made builds saved and conveniently switch between them via a dropdown menu on the skills page. This not only lets you enjoy the theorycrafting of build creation, but it also makes it quick and easy to toggle between playstyles between matches, increasing variety and replayability! https://i.imgur.com/JtkUxOl.png New Dynamic Music The fast-paced gameplay of Geneshift is ultimately designed to give you one thing above all others - a rush of adrenaline. And nothing affects our feels more powerfully than music. Which is why I've started redoing some of the old tunes, cranking up the beat and the intensity. I'm also designing this new music in a special way. The rounds in Geneshift are exactly 5 minutes long, with supply drops appearing at the 4:00, 2:00 and 0:00 marks. So I have designed the music to sync up perfectly with these key action moments, and crank the intensity just as the supply drops land and the big high-stakes fights break out all across Subvein City. https://i.imgur.com/wCicQBy.png Conquest Mode Conquest mode now works on a ticket system, similar to the Battlefield games. Each team starts with 500 tickets and you win by removing all the enemy team's tickets. There are 2 ways to remove enemy tickets. Kills will reduce their count by 1. But so will holding more control points than the enemy team, which causes their tickets to slowly bleed down as well. This change ensures that each Conquest match lasts a reasonable duration, and doesn't drag on for hours like the old mode allowed. https://i.imgur.com/1peN4RJ.jpg Extremely Easy Revivals - Until Overtime The role of zombie revivals has been rethought and it is now easier than ever to revive. As a zombie you simply need to get just 1 kill vs a survivor to come back to life. Not only that, but there are now THREE heart crates that land when the round timer hits 0:00, tripling your chances of coming back. Due to these changes it is extremely easy to revive during the first 5 minutes of each round. This lets you roam the map freely, take risks, fight cops and generally enjoying the sandboxy GTA vibes without fear of dying. Geneshift is moving in the GTA direction and that means the rules need to support chaos and action and the occassional death. This is now possible with easy revivals. But Geneshift is still a BR right? Yes! For starters, there is a new $5000 reward for players who survive the full round and make it to overtime without dying. Secondly, once overtime begins it becomes very difficult to revive. So the true BR survival experience begins during overtime. At this point you don't want to die, because you won't be able to revive, and the best way to get score is still to place as high as possible in the round. https://i.imgur.com/nECEBTj.png Free to Play Later This Year! In other news, Geneshift will go Free to Play some time later this year! This will do wonders for our playerbase, and make it easier than ever to play with friends. The multiplayer will go F2P, and the Supporter's Edition DLC will continue to exist for those who want to support development. Anyone who has ever spent money on the game (and therefore owns the Supporter's Edition) will continue to keep the DLC. Anyone who buys the game before we go F2P will also get the DLC (as it is included in the base package) for the same price as it'll be after going F2P. It will take a few months to prepare for the launch. I need to make new trailers, completely redo the Steam page, and even slightly change the name of the game! Geneshift has changed a lot over the years! It doesn't look or play anything like it did when it first hit Early Access in 2017, and so it needs a new look to reflect that before it's made available to the F2P audience on Steam. Anyway, exciting times ahead! I'll make an announcement with details closer to the date. Stay tuned and have fun!

308600,"1.44: Helicopters, Betting and a Brand New Skill Tree!","https://i.imgur.com/1JeFrYC.gif Kill Coins Reworked This version completely reworks the skill tree and the progression system. Kill coins are the main way to unlock content in the game, but they are now only used to unlock skills. This means that all other content that was previously unlocked via coins is now free. All players now have access to every weapon, chemical, and vehicle in the game. Important: Because of this drastic change, I have refunded everyone's kill coins. This way no one will have wasted their coins unlocking weapons which are now given for free. With all your coins refunded, you can start unlocking some of the new skills in the new skill tree! https://i.imgur.com/hgtZFpL.png A New Skill Tree The skills have been rearranged into a groovy new skill tree. This tree not only looks cooler than the old hex grid, but is far more flexible. If you see someone use a certain skill in-game, you are only a few steps away from unlocking it. This is far nicer than the old system, where you simply had to grind through the hex grid until you reached a certain skill. Players now get to decide what skill to get next, and whether they should focus more on damage, healing, or utility. A well diversified selection of skills gives you more versatility in the battle field! Customizable Skill Builds Wanna play with your favorite skill? Well now you can! Up the top of the skills page is a new Skill Builds feature. This lets players force skills appear at specific moments in the skill draft. For example, you can guarantee that the Self Repair skill will show up when you hit level 9 in-game. If you own the Supporter's Edition DLC you can configure a skill to show up at level 3 and level 6 as well. https://i.imgur.com/CNAhiCx.gif Skill Medallions & Progression You may notice in the screenshot above some little badges on the skills. These are skill medallions. They are purely cosmetic, but you can rank them up by completing skill specific challenges. For example, you need to get 5 Plasma Ball kills to rank Plasma up to level 2. When you do your main account will gain experience, and your badge will improve in appearance. These badges go all the way up to level 20 and are visible for other players to see at the end of each match. A great way to show off your skills. 6 Brand New Skills - ILLICIT INCOME: Increases the cash and health you gain from killing enemies. This increases further based on your wanted level. By default, player kills give +50 health. - MANIC MECHANIC: Allows you to shoot out the window of your car while driving (with worse accuracy). Also continuously restores the health of the vehicle and all passengers inside it. - CHEMICAL BOOST: Makes you jump higher when standing in your chemicals. Also makes your chemicals restore charges faster. - CLUSTER BOMB: Spawns grenades that spin around you. These grenades will be randomly tossed at nearby enemies over time. If you have Skill Shot charges you will throw 1 extra grenade per charge, and then lose a charge. - SOUL DROP: Whenever you fall onto the ground near an enemy you will reduce their rate of fire. Enemies killed in this state will drop an extra heart piece on death. - TOXIC BLOOD: Whenever you kill an enemy they will leave a pool of toxic blood on the ground. Any enemies who step in this will become poisoned and take damage over time. https://i.imgur.com/JqTiUcU.jpg Free Level-Based Cosmetics Cosmetics used to be unlocked with kill coins. Now they are given to players for free, but based on your player level. Every 5 levels a new cosmetic will be unlocked. This finally gives your account level a purpose. It actually does something now. It makes you look pretty. There are also new cosmetics. There are 7 head types to choose from. You can stick with the original Dragonball Z style hair, or go for something a little less extreme. Eventually you'll unlock a police helmet and an assassin's hood. There are other cosmetics too. The Supporter's Medallion now changes in appearance as you level up, glowing gold once you reach level 100. https://i.imgur.com/G6AhKkR.gif Helicopters! Geneshift now has helicopters! Why? Because they're damn cool that's why. They also create a much needed ""point of interest"" in the map. They shoot out free bits of loot every few seconds and slowly travel across the map. This creates a natural hot-zone that players flock to. Free loot and a guaranteed place to get some kills. Zombies are coded to spawn next to these helicopters to further increase the action. Rare Loot Spawners Rare loot crates now fall into these things called Loot Spawners. A loot spawner will sit on the ground and display a 60 second countdown. When the timer hits 0, a rare loot crate will fall into it. Destroy the crate and you'll get +3 score, a heart fragment, and some high value loot. A tier2 weapon, chemical, perk, or phase shift. Half of these loot spawners are hidden on rooftops only accessible via parkour puzzlery. The other half are out in the open, mak...",1651489094,
308600,1.42: Infinite Shifting!,"https://i.imgur.com/Hw7yAWo.gif Infinite Shifting This version focuses on making the core gameplay loop as smooth and fun as possible. The biggest change is to shifts. I always found it frustrating to run out of shifts mid-combat. You want to dodge an incoming bazooka shot only to hear a ""brrrrr"" error noise and die instead. Well no more! Players can now spam shift as much as they like. The game will never deny your movement. This helps you escape, chase, jump and dodge, and really makes the game live up to the name GeneSHIFT. To prevent players from just spamming shift non-stop we each have 3 shift charges. If you have a charge available and shift, you'll deal bonus critical damage. But if you try shift without any charges remaining you will lose health instead. You can still move, but it'll cost you. You'll lose 10hp every time you shift while empty. This creates interesting tactical decisions. It's still a wise move to dodge an incoming bazooka shot, but not something you want to spam in combat. https://i.imgur.com/d48tmEF.jpg Homing Bazooka Missiles Bazookas now firing homing missiles that seek towards you. This is fun because the bazooka is now the weapon of choice for cops. 75% of cops will fire a bazooka at you, and I've tweaked the speed to be juuuust right. Fast enough to pose a threat, but slow enough to dodge if you shift at the perfect moment (and you can always shift now!). https://i.imgur.com/B6jZznf.jpg Survival Reworks Survival mode also got plenty of polish this version. There are now only 2 difficulty levels, Standard and Hardcore, and hardcore mode is hard indeed! A lot of playtesting was done to smooth out the difficulty curve, especially in co-op mode. In hardcore lives are rare, bots are more accurate, and you have to survive a bonus 5th round where zombies will swarm you in increasing intensity right up till the final showdown. At the end of each round a special civilian vendor will appear giving you a choice of 3 bonus perks as well. You'll need to choose wisely to survive the onslaught at the end of the match! https://i.imgur.com/uepAxf2.png Quality of Life Changes & an Improved Tutorial Another big focus was making the game easier for new players. I got my gf to try the game and she was.. confused, to say the least. The tutorial now has far better pacing, by letting new players choose when they're ready to proceed instead of automatically throwing them into the next lesson. The HUD now indicates useful information like the time remaining on your wanted level and the number of shifts you have remaining (shown as triangles on your crosshair). https://i.imgur.com/Ri7QMFi.jpg General Gameplay Polish Players hitboxes are smaller so we can now hide properly behind cover. The skill drafting algorithm is now pseudorandom to ensure you see all skill equally over the last few games. Cops drop more loot, cash, score and XP. Vendors won't automatically shoot you if a stray bullet hits them. Blast Cannon has been reworked into a super shotgun, and can now be charged up over 1s to deal 2x damage. Black Hole now has lifesteal, and can be used to farm health off clusters of civilians. Plenty more balance and bug fixes are mentioned in the changelog below! https://i.imgur.com/hp0GggE.gif Full Changelog --- BIGGEST CHANGES --- - Players can shift even once they run out of charges. Your movement is never denied. However if you shift without charges you will lose 5, then 10, then 15hp per shift. - There are now only 2 difficulty levels across the entire game. Standard and Hardcore. This affects the campaign, survival and in pvp mode. Hardcore mode is now extra hard. --- SURVIVAL CHANGES --- - You progress through wanted levels 50% faster in hardcore mode (applies to both survival and pvp) - You start with only 1 bonus life instead of 4 in hardcore mode, and quarter-hearts drop every 3 instead of every 2 kills. - You no longer get +10 placement score per round in survival - Civ missions now give +5 score instead of +3 score in survival mode - Hardcore survival mode now has 5 rounds, and in the 5th round you will be swarmed by zombies - If you become a zombie in coop survival mode you can no longer collect hearts from kills. The only way to rez is to capture a genetic heart (or wait till next round). - Coop zombies in survival are no longer killed off at 0:00, but they cannot respawn after 0:00 - Zombie humans can now fire guns inside the red zone in survival mode (in coop) - Fixed a bug where the entire server of bots would swarm the heart in survival mode - The amount of cash and xp earned from kills now increases with the number of players in coop survival mode. 200/300/400/500 cash and 20/30/40/50xp - The $1000 assassination bounty is now awarded to all players in coop survival mode, to prevent competing over it - Tweaked the AI to make them spread out far more evenly across the map, instead of clustering in one area - The price of blood bags increases by $1000 everytime you buy one. - Reduced max h...",1644901225,
308600,1.41: Exploration and Parkour Puzzles!,"https://i.imgur.com/nGPKDbn.jpg Exploring for Rare Loot This version taps into that fun feeling of discovery and exploration in GTA. You find a random staircase, climb onto a rooftop and discover a cool item as a reward for your efforts. Geneshift now does this with the addition of rare loot crates. These boxes glow in purple and contain extra valuable items such as superweapons, chemicals, $5000 perks, life fragments, etc. The megamap has been updated with over 50 spawn points where these rare loot crates might spawn. Each location has been designed as a puzzle, which requires some form of parkour to get to. In the screenshot below you can see a rare loot crate has spawned in a new balcony area. This balcony is too high up to access via normal jumping, and requires you to parkour your way up there, as shown with the arrows below. The idea with these puzzles is to provide players a change of pace from the fast-paced combat of Geneshift. They also make exploration more fun, and get you using your brain to solve puzzles in completely different ways. https://i.imgur.com/JnD1xM5.jpg Shifting Now Gives Critical Bullets Everytime you shift there is now a brief window of time where your gun will fire critical bullets. You see an enemy, shift towards him, and then have 0.5s to fire off a few rounds with extra damage. This window of time is small, so you better make sure those critical bullets hit! Critical bullets deal +20% damage, which can be increased to +50% damage via looting ammo kits. Previously, critical bullets played a fairly small role in the game as they were only available as the final bullets in your magazine. But now they're relevant to every single fight as long as you have the quick aim and timing to use them effectively. https://i.imgur.com/qRceklA.jpg +50% damage is a lot! It can easily decide the winner of a fight. A well timed shift might give you the extra damage needed to secure the kill. But you might instead choose to save your shift so you can escape to safety at the last minute. By giving shifts both an offensive and defensive use, shifts are far more interesting to use. To offset this huge buff, shifts now regenerate a lot slower (once every 4 seconds). We're also capped at only max 3 shifts at a time - so use them wisely! It is possible to bring that max up to 5 shifts, but only if you find them in the purple rare crates mentioned above. Basically shifts are now a lot more powerful than before, but a lot rarer too - so use them wisely! https://i.imgur.com/lwC9Ekw.gif New Life Mechanics in Survival A big issue with survival mode was how to cater to players of different skill levels. Generally it was too hard for newbies and far too easy for veterans. This has been solved with a whole new economy around lives. For starters, bots are a lot harder. More accurate, bigger guns, more skills, etc. There is also a minimum number of bots you must ""assassinate"" each round, to force players to take action and not hide on a rooftop somewhere. You're now going to be in a lot of tough fights, and are going to lose lives in the process. This keeps things far more engaging for skillful players. https://i.imgur.com/b6vc5oO.jpg To offset this increased difficulty there are new ways to gain back these lives. You can now buy them for $3000 at vendors, and you can find them in the new purple loot crates. Lives are now your main ""resource"" in the game, and you'll need to explore, farm cops, get sick combo kills to earn enough cash to buy the lives necessary to survive. There are additional incentives for skillful players to play their very best as well. If you manage to survive a round without losing a single life, a free supply drop will land next to you which gives bonus score and goodies. You can also SELL your lives for extra XP if you're feeling risky and don't think you'll die anyway. https://i.imgur.com/rPOtpeQ.jpg Zombie Swarm Survival also has a new zombie swarm stage that happens at the end of each round. After you kill all the players, zombies will respawn and swarm you with their meaty fists. This can be quite challenging, but really rewards skillful usage of area of effect skills and chemicals, because the combo-kill potential is insane. https://i.imgur.com/TkmpfYB.gif Full Changelog --- BIGGEST CHANGES --- - For a brief 0.5s after shifting, your gun will fire critical bullets. This gives shifts a new offensive usage and makes them worth saving up for tough encounters. - Added over 50 secret loot areas to the megamap. These loot areas will occassionally spawn a RARE crate with expensive loot. However, they are often hidden or require you to figure out a jumping puzzle to get them. - If you avoid losing a life within a survival round, a bonus supply drop will land next to you at the end of the round - Survival mode is quite a bit harder, but you can now buy extra lives from vendors for $3000 - In survival mode you now have the ability to SELL lives from vendors for 300xp per heart - Bots no longer...",1640206844,
308600,1.40: Freeze! It's the cops!,"Cops and Cop Cars For a ""GTA-inspired"" game it sure took a long time to add cops - but they are finally here! We have cops, cop cars, special forces and more. If a cop sees you commit a crime your wanted level will raise - with an increasingly larger force trying to take you down. Cops add plenty of flavor and action to the game, with emergent car chases, vehicle explosions, chain reactions and new cop-centric missions. Cops provide a whole new level of risk/reward decision making to PvP games. You can intentionally farm waves of cops for bonus loot - but you might not survive. If you want to lose the cops you have two choices. Pay a bounty at a vendor, or escape the blue circle on your minimap. If you go for the later you better bring a car, because the cops will chase you down, sirens blaring. https://i.imgur.com/2bVvGI5.gif Civilian Combat & Kill Combos PvE is more exciting not only with the cops but also with the addition of kill combos. If you kill two enemies in a row you'll get a double kill which pays out 2x XP and cash. Triple kills give 3x, Quad kills 4x, and Multikills 5x. You need to kill within 2.0s to maintain your combo, and while multikills are rare, they feel VERY satisfying. This change makes cop and civilian combat far more interesting. Sure you could just fire a bazooka at a cop car. But if you wait a moment you can line it up to kill a nearby civilian as well, getting 2x the reward. This quick decision makes every civilian or cop and opportunity to test your skills and get rewarded for it. As you level up in-game your weapons and skills get stronger, which makes it easier to pull off these combos. This creates a sort of farming engine, where the stronger you become the faster you can farm, similar to farming creeps in MOBAs. All the skills have been given bonus damage modifiers against civilians, and civilian combos brings a whole new way to use the existing skills in the game. https://i.imgur.com/xCmL9LQ.gif Scoring now Rewards PvE Combat This version places a large emphasis on PvE combat in preparation for the upcoming roguelite mode. Scoring has been reworked to give points for killing cops and civilians, as well as completing missions. If you want to play GTA and fight an army of cops with a minigun you can do so - and get score for it. This creates new paths to victory and viable new playstyles. A new scoretab shows when you hold TAB which shows you exactly what your score is, how it was calculated, and what else you can do to maximise it. This should help new players understand how to win the game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/fea18a6fa0d506c2370204e1d3d4f0083b1d7eee.png Vehicles go BOOM! There's also a focus on sandboxy, explosive GTA mayhem. There are a lot more civilians in the map, and more cars driving around as well, making the city feel far more alive. This version really redefines the role of cars in the game as well - to go BOOM! Cop cars will chase you but their hitpoints are low. A well placed bazooka will set off chain reactions of explosions as the cop cars detonate. Graphics and FPS & Netcode Improvements I've reworked the lighting engine to not only run faster but look better too. The cop sirens look pretty great as they zoom along, reflecting off the fog and shiny metal objects. Bullets are cleaner, muzzle flashes brighter, and explosions bigger. Turn on high GFX mode and enjoy! https://i.imgur.com/JnS6WAz.gif Other Juicy Changes There are plenty of other neat changes. Health upgrades no longer reset when you die, Smoke Bomb has been reworked to turn you invisible, QoL improvements, a new arrow in the HUD directs you towards the nearest civilian mission, better vehicle handling, and the usual balancing and bug fixing. Read the changelog below for the full list! Full Changelog --- BIGGEST CHANGES --- - Police now exist in the game. They will patrol the streets on foot or in a car, and if you commit a crime nearby they will start hunting you - Added a new kill combo system that makes civilian kills more fun. If you get kills within 2.0s of eachother you'll gain a combo multiplier and earn more cash and XP. - Completely reworked scoring. It's still first to 50 points, but you can now get score for killing civilians, cops, and doing missions. Much more of a PvE focus. - Significant peformance optimisation as well as beautiful graphical improvements made to dynamic lighting (try High GFX!) --- POLICE MECHANICS --- - Wanted levels go up when you kill cops. Wanted 1 = fists, wanted 2 = pistols, wanted 3 = primary weapons, wanted 4 = special forces, wanted 5 = civilians riot. - To lose your wanted level you must escape the blue circle on the minimap then hide for 30s. If you damage a cop the timer will reset. - You can also lose your wanted level by paying a bounty at civilian vendors. It costs $500 per wanted level. - On wanted level 4 cops will start spawning as ""special forces"" types and be able to cast skills. Each wave of cops will cast a randomised skill (a wave of Pl...",1632762010,
308600,1.32: Skill Drafting & Vendors!,"Roguelite Replayability Geneshift is borrowing from the roguelite genre to massively increase the game's replayability, variety, and adaptability. The idea is to give players different guns and skills each round so that each match feels unique. No two matches will ever feel the same, and players will need to adapt to new items to survive. To do this, the old skill menu and buy menu have been removed and replaced with brand new systems with limited choices - skill drafting and vendors. Players are now rewarded for thinking on their feet and creating a smart build on the fly. Let's explore! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/894864e606f8f765b5cb49c4f7dada3fa18d1962.png Skill Drafting Whenever you level up you'll now be given a draft of just 3 skills. You can level just 1 of these 3 skills, and will get a fresh set of 3 every time you level up. This is of course a huge change, as you can no longer choose whatever skills you want anymore. But it results in every match feeling completely different as your build is never the same. You'll discover new skill combinations and have to adapt as you play. If you don't like any of the 3 options, there is an option to reroll for another set of 3, but you can only do this once every 120s. For example, you start the game and for your first skill point see Plasma Ball, Blade Fury, and Vampirism. Which do you choose? If you take Plasma, you'll want to look for other skills and guns that suit the long range playstyle. If you choose Blade Fury, you better go searching for a shotgun. Lets say you decide on a ranged build and take Plasma Ball. Then you level up again, and are offered Plasma Ball (level 2), Energize (level 1), and Self Repair (level 1). What do you choose now? When you choose one, you might not see the other options again. So what's more important? An extra powerful Plasma, or the ability to heal? Decisions decisions.. Drafting not only adds replayability and adaptability, but it will also do wonders for the new player experience too. No longer will newbies be overwhelmed with 30+ choices. There are just 3 skills to consider at a time. Furthermore, skills now go up to level 4, and this 4th level is STRONG. But the drafting algorithm won't show you the 4th level until you hit level 10, making this a nice milestone. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/cfe8f366c02ee9d62a91a1e6790479bd464b2981.png Civilian Vendors The buy menus have undergone a similar change. Instead of heading to a buy zone, pressing B, and choosing from the entire buy menu, players now must explore for Civilian Vendors. These are specials civilians with a yellow speech bubble above their head. Pressing E on them will open up a small buy list up the top right of the screen, with just 5 things for sale. Typically each vendor will sell: 1) ammo, 2) grenades, 3) a gun, 4) a chemcial or vehicle, 5) a special perk. Each vendor sells a different set of items. and players are now rewarded for exploring the map and checking out a few vendors before making a purchase. If you don't like what a vendor has for sale, find another one. Vendors will sometimes sell items on discount, such as a Minigun which is 30% off. Nothing feels better than finding a vendor who has the perfect weapon for your skill build and it's on discount. Even cooler, vendors now sell perks as well! Previously you could only get these perks by completing missions. But now you can buy them directly for $5000. For example, a vendor might be selling the +20% Firerate perk for SMGS, which works great if you've managed to buy an MP5 elsewhere. The end result of these two huge reworks is that special feeling you get in a roguelite where everything just comes together (or not). The addition of level 4 skills, discounted guns, and perks allows for some insanely overpowered combos if you ge lucky. But you won't get this everytime, so it feels extra special when you do. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/64f2052e4b30b72e345bd61a2fda7bea3f4a1a1d.png Chemical Capturing Another neat change is the ability to capture enemy chemcials. Previously you could destroy enemy chemicals by standing on them for 3 seconds, but now you will capture them instead. This is way more fun, and can result in some really interesting emergent gameplay. For example, you are walking along and discover an enemy has placed down a Health Stimulant (which gives you health regen when standing nearby it). It's out in the open and your enemy is guarding it, but you turn on Force Fields to protect you while you capture it. Now it's yours and you have the health regen. So your enemy throws down a Molotov Cocktail to get you to retreat and tries to reclaim it himself. It creates a very interesting king of the hill mechanic. Now you might be thinking ""why should I place chemcials when my enemy can just steal them from me?"" Well another change solves this. Chemicals are now hidden from enemies unless they step inside them. So you can place a Health Stimulant in an obscure corner somewhere, and get the health b...",1624588212,
308600,1.31: New HUD & Crisper Gunplay!,"A stylish new HUD & crosshair This version cleans up the HUD. It looks nicer on the eye, but more importantly removes clutter and only shows the most important information. There is also a new crosshair that expands in size based on your current level of recoil, making recoil much easier to control. Recoil in general has been increased, and combined with this new crosshair combat is significantly more skillful as recoil control is now a key component in gunplay. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/7399c44b260e327240397340f09728a4efab8267.png Skills no longer require mana Mana has been completely removed from the game. Active skills now only have cooldowns, ranging from 5s to 30s based on their strength. You'll now hear a new ""ding"" sound whenever a skill comes off cooldown. The screenshot below shows how skills are displayed in the new HUD. You can see a progress bar and countdown on each skills' cooldown (EG: Self Repair has 8s left on cooldown). This change removes the frustration of running out of mana mid-combat, and keeps you in a state of flow as you skillfully outplay your foes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/83aa49f32be2a9ed4c5278e9e2378760d3ce66b3.png Lives reworked to keep you in action The new lives mechanic has been streamlined as well. Previously when you used a life, you'd still die and respawn again.. the only difference was that you didn't come back as a zombie. But this still felt like dying. This has been changed so that when you use a life, you get to stay in the action. You'll simply consume the life and regenerate your health on the spot. This takes 3s and during this 3s you will be invulernable, move 2x faster, and be unable to shoot. This gives you (and your enemies) a 3s window to reposition and reload. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/cbacc3636d4854e2c7760fea4a5a7d22764c6480.png Critical bullets and interesting reload decisions The DMG looting system has been reworked. Ammo kits used to give you +2% damage on your gun, which was nice, but not particularily exciting. Now ammo kits give you ""critical bullets"" instead. Critical bullets do significantly more damage, ranging from +50 to +100% of your usual damage. A critical blast from the M3 Super can kill in a single shot! But there's a catch. Only some of your bullets are critical, and the critical ones are all at the end of your magazine. So an AK47 has a clip size of 30 bullets, and you might have looted 5 critical bullets. When you reload, the first 25 bullets will do a normal 10hp damage each, and the final 5 will do 20hp each, right before you reload. This creates an interesting risk/reward mechanic where you need to decide between playing it safe and reloading to get a full clip, or taking the risk to fire off those critical bullets, hoping you finish the kill before you run out of ammo. Firing these critical bullets also feels great. Your crosshair turns orange, the bullets are red, and there's plenty of screenshake and big red damage numbers pop up when they hit. In a gun like the Barrett, that final shot does +50% damage and might be enough for a 1-shot kill - but you better not miss. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/79b4e21c0ec14420b9c44c2dc967ab20c14d4058.png Full Changelog --- BIGGEST CHANGES --- - Completely redesigned the HUD, including a new crosshair that dynamically shows your gun's recoil. - Mana has been removed from the game. Skills now rely entirely on cooldowns instead. - When you lose a bonus life you'll no longer respawn, but will stay alive in the action. You'll simply consume the heart and gain your health back over the next 3s. - Weapons now have a new concept called ""critical bullets"" which do huge bonus damage (+50 to +100%). However, you only have a few of these bullets at the very end of your gun's magazine. - You can no longer buy ammo from anywhere in the map, however all guns have 2x as much reserve ammo. - Vehicles now have infinite boost. --- GAMEPLAY CHANGES --- - Zombies can no longer use guns in the red zone. - Lives are now dropped from enemies when you kill them instead of gaining a flat +0.2 per kill. - Lives become less likely to drop as the remaining player count gets below 10, and in the final 1v1 no lives drop from kills. - When using a life, you will not be able to shoot, but you also won't take any damage. You'll also move 2x faster so you can ecape to safety. - In Survival mode you now start with 3 bonus lives, but the enemies are much harder. - Civilians now drop a random amount of cash. - Looting ammo kits gives you more critical bullets. - In overtime in BR (not survival), health, cash, and ammo kits will fall from the sky into the red area, to incentivize survivors to get out into the open and grab the loot. - Survivors now gain +2 score when there are 25,20,15,10,5,4,3,2 players remaining (instead of gaining +1 per minute). - Killing survivors now gives +2 score per kill (killing zombies is still +1). - Civilian missions now award $2000 instead of $1000. - Added some red bars along the top and bottom o...",1620054020,
308600,Get the feel of the classic GTA2 played online in Geneshift with a massive new map,"Lots of people love the original GTA and GTA2, myself included and Geneshift has a major overhaul (again) that tweaks the Battle Royale gameplay along with a huge new map to give classic GTA2 vibes. Read the full article here: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/get-the-feel-of-the-classic-gta2-played-online-in-geneshift-with-a-massive-new-map ",1608641474,
308600,1.30: Huge new city map!,"Welcome to Subvein City This new map is 5x larger than before. With classic GTA2 vibes, this map feels immersive and completely transforms the game. Vehicles play a critical role in transport now, and the rules of Battle Royale have been changed to work on a larger scale. Over the coming versions I want to make Geneshift more sandboxy with a focus on exploration, and this mega map is a great place to start. https://i.imgur.com/HNJmM2v.png Sexy New Graphics To go with the mega map we now have a new day/night cycle, fog effects, lens flares, rain and thunder, and more. It's a significant upgrade to the aesthetics of the game and the weather patterns really make the new map a lot more immersive. https://i.imgur.com/0iesrGI.png Critical Gameplay Changes - Enemies now have health bars above their heads. It feels satisfying to hit people and prioritize targets based on who has the lowest health. - You can now rebuy ammo from anywhere in the map at any time. Just press B and buy ammo. - Whenever you fire your gun you will be revealed for 1.5s to all other players nearby. This makes it much easier to find action in the minimap. - Phase drifting has been removed as a default ability but made into a new skill in the Physical tree. - Weapons have a reduced range, preventing people from firing at you off-screen. - The firing delay on active skills like Plasma Ball has been reduced from 1.0s to 0.5s. https://i.imgur.com/JxmqACn.png Battle Royale Mechanics Everything has been scaled up for the new massive map. We have more players, longer rounds and a new scoring system to keep matches between 15 to 30 minutes. Instead of first to win 3 rounds, it's first to 50 points. With this change there are many new ways to gain score like doing civilian missions, hunting for kills or winning supply drops. This also allows you to feel productive even as a zombie. https://i.imgur.com/y9VXvD3.png New Zombie Resurrection Mechanics Most exciting are the new rules for zombies, making zombie gameplay far more engaging and free. A few highlights are: - Zombies can keep respawning infinitely and aren't forced to spectate. - Zombies can now fire guns in the red zone, but take 2x damage. - Zombies no longer resurrect from killing a survivor, but instead killing 5 enemies in a row (zombies included). - Zombies can now resurrect with a new special ""Heart"" supply drop which falls every 2 minutes. These final 2 points completely change the zombie meta, and let you focus on exploring the map, getting quality kill streaks, and winning the super intense Heart drop. To win the heart you simply need to stand on it for 5s. But be careful, because every other zombie will try do the same and only 1 player gets to revive! https://i.imgur.com/4GnyTyu.png New Lives Mechanic Another big addition is the new lives mechanic. Battle royale is the last man alive. By default we all start with 1 life, and if you die you become a zombie with 0 lives. But now you have the ability to earn bonus lives! Every kill gives you +0.2 lives, so if you get 5 kills in a row you'll gain a backup life. If you get another 5 kills in a row you'll have 2 backup lives. These backup lives mean that if you die, you'll consume the life but will not become a zombie. This system provides a much needed incentive to hunt for kills instead of hiding on a roof somewhere surviving. Every kill is exciting as it gets you one step closer to that bonus life that might let you win the game. https://i.imgur.com/5qlmLxq.jpg Chemical Charges System Chemicals now come with charges making them far more useful. When you buy a Warp Field chemical, it now lets you place FOUR warp fields instead of just 1. The charges refill every 2 minutes, so you can keep on placing them. Huge buff to chemicals, as a single chemical can be used to fully prepare an area for maximum advantage. I personally like to place Trip Wires all around the incoming supply drop. https://i.imgur.com/NH38VUN.png Streamlining Skills System Skills have been streamlined in a few ways. Firstly, you can take a skill directly up to level 3, without the confusing requirement to get 4/9/14 skills in that tree first. Secondly, each tree now gives you a passive bonus for each skill point in the tree. Every point in the Cybernetic tree gives you a passive +2% damage. Physical skills give +0.5 health regen per skill point, and Mental skills +20% shift regen per point. The old skill queue system has been disabled by default, because it's honestly more fun to choose your own build as you play.

308600,1.28: Complete progression rework!,"Ingame Progression Reworks This version completely reworks all the systems of the game. There is a huge focus on in-game progression, the core gameplay loop, and giving a sense of becoming stronger and stronger within the match. You'll start with a single skill point but can now level up by killing people. Meanwhile, cash is never wasted as your weapons and chemicals are no longer lost on death. Instead, your purchases last forever allowing for key strategic decisions on how you create your build in-game. https://i.imgur.com/YDl2wIu.png Complete Skills Rework The biggest change is to the skills system. We now start each match at level 1, with a single skill point. But as you kill enemies you will now gain xp and level up. Each level lets you invest another skill point and become more powerful. This is especially true as every skill in the game has been reworked to remove skill penalties. If you put a point into Vampirism you get free healing with absolutely no downside. Level 3 skills are objectively more powerful than level 1 skills, and every skill point is valuable. All of the skills have been individually tweaked as well, and some completely reworked. For example, Radiate now fires a nuclear missile at your target location. Active skills have become more skillful to use too, by adding minor firing delays that require you to use the skills tactically instead of blindly firing them in combat. https://i.imgur.com/chTr7bM.png Permanent Weapons, Chemicals and Cars Killing enemies not only gives you XP to level up your skills, but it also gives you cash. And now cash is really valuable. Why? Because the things you can buy with cash (weapons, chemicals and cars) are now all permanent. Before this version, you might save up $5000 to buy a super weapon, only to die and lose it all. This hurt a lot and removed any sense of progress you got from earning cash. But no more! Now you get to keep your weapons and chemicals on death, meaning that the expensive weapon you bought will be yours for the rest of the match. The price of these items has been increased to compensate for this, and this creates some interesting milestones throughout the course of a match. You start by buying a tier1 gun, then saving $5000 for a tier2 gun, and then $10000 for a superweapon. Which weapon you buy (or chemical) has now become a big, important, strategic decision. But whatever you choose, you'll be growing more powerful and truly rewarded for the cash you earn in-game. https://i.imgur.com/DMTFRG6.png Phase Drifting & Supply Crates There is a new way to move around the map - phase drifting! Simply double-tap shift and you will go into a new sliding motion. This lets you move around the map faster, and you will gain in speed the longer you can travel too - but there's a catch. Your movement has momentum, like you're skating on ice. This requires a bit of skill to pull off, but once you get the hang of it you'll be Tokyo drifting around corners and ramming into supply crates. This change simply makes movement fun. Supply crates are a new addition to the game too. The random loot scattered around the map is now bundled up into these crates, making them like fun little presents to open up. You can even use them as temporary cover to block against enemy bullets (until they explode). The main supply drop comes in a super golden grate with extra health and lots of goodies inside. https://i.imgur.com/4gWUdFM.png Complete Chemical Rework The chemical system now works in a fundamentally different way. Before, you had to choose between either holding a chemical, or placing it on the ground for different benefits. This was a tough choice and often people chose to go for the simpler option of just carrying them. But now you don't need to choose. When you buy a chemical you get both the carried version AND the placed version for free. You can pour some of your chemical onto the ground to get the placed benefits, while still holding onto it. Then after a 120s cooldown, you can place it down again in case someone destroys it. This makes it significantly easier to set up a quick base around a key area, as you always have your passive chemicals on hand. For example, you might decide to buy 2 Sonar Cells and a Fission Mine. You go to a building, and set Sonar's on the chokepoints and a Fission Mine on the buy zone. They after you win your fight there, you can run to the next location, wait for the cooldown to expire and reposition your chemicals again. Just as with weapons, the chemicals you purchase are permanent for the rest of the match, and act as significant tech upgrades that grow you more and more powerful. A few more chemical changes are that now everyone can destroy chemicals at any time, for free. Simply stand on an enemy chemical, hold CTRL and click Neutralize. This works now because enemy chemicals aren't permanently destroyed, but merely put on cooldown and can be replaced later (it would've been too powerful otherwise). Also, Alchemic Acid...",1596468615,
308600,Thanks for participating this weekend!,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/8718229f0c0313fa500275a62f4d9bcddb246025.png UPDATE: Thanks for playing! The giveaway has ended and it's been a lot of fun! The servers have never been fuller and I've received some fantastic feedback from all the new players. I hope you all continue to enjoy the game as I implement this feedback over the coming weeks. UPDATE: Lessons Learned There were a few hiccups, mostly servers crashing and people not being able to log in, but those have fortunately been fixed. There was also some confusion about the nature of the giveaway, as the DLC was not included. I made sure to mention this on the Steam page and in the announcement, but understandably not everyone read this. But I'm grateful to the people who left reviews on this topic, as it's made me rethink the business model. People were mostly concerned about the progression benefits of the DLC, and as a result I have significantly toned this down. You used to unlock items significantly faster with the DLC. This didn't give any exclusive access to items, but it did allow you to earn kill coins 5x faster, saving you time. But this was simply too different of a gaming experience for those who did and didn't have the DLC, which this giveaway made clear. So I've made big sweeping changes to fix it and greatly nerfed this DLC benefit. Non DLC players can now progress 3 to 5x faster than before, as you now get more rewards from leaderboards, challenges, and leveling up. If you do get the DLC, you'll get a minor 2x coin boost only to the challenges and leveling up, but nothing else. For example if you top the daily leaderboards you'll now get the same +200 coin bonus whether you have the DLC or not (it used to be only 40 coins without the DLC). I've also flattened the costs to unlock new items to give a more steady sense of progression. Anyway, I've made this fix and the game plays a lot better because of it. So thanks again to everyone who made their voices heard and letting me know! Over the next few weeks I'll continue going through all the reviews, analysing the feedback and making changes. You can follow the dev updates in the official discord at: discord.gg/geneshift {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/b7adbaca0b342a727bda8a46cee18e9d140b23e4.png Get Geneshift for free! For the next 48 hours you can get the base game of Geneshift 100% free. Please keep in mind that this giveaway is only for the base game and does not include the Supporter's Edition DLC. Fortunately, the base game has 95% of the content and is all you need to play, so please tell your friends and get it while you can! There are going to be a LOT of players online due to this giveaway, so if you want to dominate the PvP servers, or are curious about the brand new singleplayer survival game mode, now's the time to play! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/57abfde6428cb1f8b55840e736bf0ee56d4898d9.png Play the New Singleplayer Mode! Last week Geneshift released a HUGE new version with a whole new singleplayer game mode - Daily Survival Runs. You fight 12 rounds against increasingly deadly enemies and see how long you can survive. Each round the enemy grows stronger and the only way to survive is to complete these new GTA2 style missions for civilians, which give you randomly generated bonuses to your items. These bonuses are great fun and give you crazy powers like +50% movement speed on your knife, or +200% size when you cast Radiate. You'll need to adapt your play-style based on the bonuses you get if you want to survive and top the leaderboards. These new civilian missions and their bonus rewards have been added to the PvP modes too. This game is getting more like GTA2 every version! If you like the normal Geneshift gameplay but don't want to deal with lag or veterans kicking your ass, this is the mode for you. Even better, if you own the Supporter's Edition DLC you can play this mode in 4-player co-op with friends (and only one of you needs to own it as well).",1591636505,
308600,1.27: Geneshift now has singleplayer!,"Free to Keep Giveaway Geneshift will be doing a free-to-keep giveaway on June 8th! You may have noticed that the game went free-to-keep a few weeks ago too. That was due to a miscommunication between Valve and I, so we're doing it again. There will be plenty of new people online, so make sure to join the fun! https://i.imgur.com/chTr7bM.png New Singleplayer Mode - Daily Survival Runs This version introduces a new singleplayer mode - Daily Survival Runs! You fight 12 rounds against increasingly deadly enemies and see how long you can survive. Each round the enemy grows stronger by gaining more damage, health and skills. The final rounds are very difficult, and the only way to survive them is to grow stronger yourself, which you do by completing missions and unlocking special bonuses. You can play this new mode once per day, and after you win (or lose) your score will be added to the new daily survival leaderboards. If you manage to survive all 12 rounds, you'll unlock Hardcore, then Insane, and finally Ultimate difficulty - where you can play endlessly to try set the highest score possible. If you like the normal Geneshift gameplay but don't want to deal with lag or veterans kicking your ass, this is the mode for you. Even better, if you own the Supporters Edition DLC you are able to play this mode in 4-player co-op! https://i.imgur.com/gbnWCKs.png Civilian Missions Some civilians now have a little ""HELP ME"" text bubble above them. Pressing on these civilians will start a mission. These missions are available in all game modes, but are especially designed for the new survival mode. They will have you doing things like driving over civilians, or taking out armed thugs, or killing enemies without taking any damage. Every mission is different, and in co-op you complete them together with your allies and all share the rewards. What rewards you ask? https://i.imgur.com/LdloD7A.png Random Item Bonuses When you complete a civilian mission you get a special reward that lasts for the rest of the match. For example, you might unlock +80% bullet speed on the AK47, or +50% damage on Plasma Ball. These are generated in a semi-random way, trying to buff items that you're already holding, but exactly which item is unknown. Also, in the new survival mode you'll start the match with 3 randomly generated bonuses, which are reset every 24 hours and shared by everyone. These random bonuses encourages you to adapt, and makes every game feel different. One round you might be sniping due to the extra high damage Plasma Ball, and another you might be charging with a shotgun due to the +30% movement speed on the M3. It's a whole lot of fun trying out these OP bonuses, and a big strategy to winning the new survival mode is to get as many as you can in early rounds to try survive the later ones. https://i.imgur.com/Sbpxd9z.png Weapon & Ammo Mechanics You can now carry 2 primary weapons at the same time, allowing for smart combos like a sniper & shotgun combo. However it takes longer to swap between them, and you might want to use a pistol anyway for the faster swapping. The cost of ammo has also been increased significantly, making cash a lot more valuable. The ammo cost is especially high for tier2 weapons, and even more for superweapons. This creates an interesting dynamic where you get more damage at higher tiers, but the ammo efficiency is way worse, meaning you'll need to save up cash in early rounds to sustain the ammo in later rounds when you are forced to use a higher tier gun (in survival). Skill System Streamlined Skills now only require 2 points to max out, instead of 4. Before, there was no point in leveling a skill to level 2 or 3.. it was just a waste of time clicking. Now things are clean. Your first point into the skill unlocks it, and the next point maxes it out. The new level 2 skill has the same power as the old level 4, so it's just been rescaled. But wait, there's more! Because if you spend 8 skill points within the same tree, you gain the ability to spend a third skill point on those skills within the tree, and this third point is much much stronger than anything we've seen before (the equivalent of level 6 from last version, if such a level existed). Also, you can now freely unlock skills from any skill tree. Meaning you can combine Cybernetic, Physical and Mental skills together without having to pay any cost. This really opens up the skill builds you can create. Another change is that everyone's starting level has been drastically reduced, but there are more skill points lying around. This places an emphasis on looting for skill points and actually growing stronger throughout the round. https://i.imgur.com/CguRt2d.png Chemical & Vehicle Improvements You can now shoot 360 degrees out the window of your car, instead of just 180 degrees to the side you're on. This makes driveby shootings much easier to do. To compensate for this the car offers less protection. Chemicals are improved too, as you can now carry up t...",1590764468,

I have sent them numerous support requests to reschedule the giveaway to June as planned, but have yet to receive a response. (to be fair, they work on Valve time). Let me tell you, after a shock like that I didn't even need my morning coffee. I've asked Valve to cancel this giveaway now, so that I can do it *properly* in early June as planned. This means that the giveaway might randomly go away sometime in the next few hours. Rest assured, if you got the game for free, you will keep the game for free.

308600,1.26: Total Chemical Rework and the Genetic Heart!,"Chemical Passive Abilities The biggest change this version is in the new chemical system. ""What chemical system?"" I hear you ask? I don't blame you, as it was FAR too confusing before. Well no longer. Chemicals have been improved in various ways. The biggest of which is that chemicals now give you a passive ability when you carry them! For example, if you carry a Warp Field, you will increase your max shifts by +2. Chemicals are much cheaper now too ($1000) each. So you can almost view chemicals as cheap combat enhancements. Even if you never place them, you can spend a cool $1000 for some serious upgrades! Such as: - Synthetic Shop (previously called Base Chemicals) gives you +20% ammo. - Alchemic Acid gives you +20% cash for kills and loot. - Warp Fields give you +2 max shifts. - Sonar Cells increases your vision range. - Goo Trap slows enemies with your bullets. - Health and Mana stimulants now increase max hp/mana by +20. - Damage Stimulant increases your gun's DMG by +5% per kill. - Fission Mine (a new chem) makes you throw 2x grenades at once. - Laser Tripwire (a new chem) removes all weapon recoil. - Neutralizer now makes you immune to enemy chemicals. https://i.imgur.com/77WCDJt.png Brand New Chemicals There are 2 brand new chemicals that do some really fun stuff when placed as well - Fission Mines and Laser Tripwires. When an enemy steps inside your Fission Mine, it will detonate with a HUGE explosion dealing 100hp damage to anyone nearby. They have 1.5s to escape before the boom. Laser Tripwires let you set up a tripwire across a chokepoint, which shoots a laser beam at anyone who steps into it, taking off half their health. These new chemicals are great for area control, and are an intuitive way for new players to understand the chemical system. Chemicals are now Visible Another huge change is that when you place a chemical on the ground it is now visible to your enemies. Yes, you can actually *SEE* them, unlike before where they were all invisible. This is a huge change, and makes it far easier to find and destroy enemy chemicals, which will award you big bucks! If you want you can still make your chemical invisible, but this will cost you an extra $1000 to ""conceal"" it. This mechanic makes for some interesting choices. For example, you could spend $1000 to buy a Laser Tripwire and place it in a chokepoint. By default this will be visible to enemies, and might deter them from coming through that route. This might be enough. However, you can upgrade it for another $1000 to make it invisible, which means they'll accidentally step into the tripwire and get shot by it. https://i.imgur.com/KfsOMfC.png Resurrect with the Genetic Heart There is a brand new way to resurrect as a zombie - finding the Genetic Heart. The Genetic Heart is a special piece of loot only available to zombies. If you step into it, you'll instantly respawn! There is only one heart in the map at any one time, and it will spawn randomly somewhere in the map. This gives zombies a great new way to get back into the game (in addition to killing a survivor). This mechanic was added to encourage looting and exploration. And because there is only one heart at a time, it becomes a race against the other zombies to find it first. Vehicles are by far the best way to do this, so you can now finally play GTA-style, cruising around in a vehicle and have an actual competitive reason for doing so! https://i.imgur.com/uS1WzCW.png Unlock Multiple Skill Trees A huge improvement to the skill system is that you can now create skill builds across multiple skill trees! You no longer have to stick to just the Cybernetic, or Mental, or Physical skill tree. You can now create a super defensive skill build that combines Self Repair (Cybernetic) with Force Fields (Physical). The options are endless! It costs 4 skill points to access each additional skill tree. https://i.imgur.com/hdHHkY8.png The Unlock Hex Grid is now Tiered The hex grid, which is where you spend Kill Coins and unlock stuff, has been split into 6 distinct tiers (containing 21 items each). You now need to fully complete the previous tier before you are able to unlock anything from the next one, and all items in a tier have the same cost. The kill coin costs per tier are 5, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200. These costs overall are cheaper than before, and are especially cheap for new players as the start of the game (as there are now a bunch of items that only cost 5 coins each). Daily Challenges now give 2x as many Kill Coins, making everything even faster to unlock. The reason for this change is to give players a sense of progression (""3 more items till I unlock the next tier!""). This also simplifies decision making. A problem the old system had was that you would end up with like 50+ items available to unlock, all of them costing different amounts of kill coins, and it was really hard to know what to get (""Do I unlock the UZI for 15 kill coins, or the Force Fields for 75 kill coins, or any of the oth...",1584709232,
308600,"1.25: Super Zombies, Cars, and a New Trailer!","New Trailer First big update of 2020! For the past 2 months I've focused on marketing preparation, such as creating a brand new website and trailer. I've also been contacting streamers, watching them play, and making some great changes to the new player experience. More on that in a moment, but first check this new trailer! Super Strong Zombies Perhaps the biggest change this version is simply this - zombies now have 100hp instead of 50hp. At first this seems like a simple change, but when you remember that 50% of your time is spent as a zombie, this is a huge change to the flow of the game. The time to kill has doubled, especially for new players who are zombies most of the time. By cranking the hit points up to 100hp, zombies now play almost identically to normal players, and the game feels a lot nicer because of it. Zombies are no longer a death-trap for new players. Upgradeable Guns Of course, with 100hp zombies being a survivor is now scarier than ever, so a number of fun changes have been added to compensate for this. First of all, killing zombies will give you more cash and experience. Always nice. But the real fun change is this - whenever you kill a zombie, your current weapon will gain +2% damage. This suddenly makes killing zombies great fun, and as a survivor you might even dare to venture out of the safe zone to hunt them, because you can upgrade your gun all the way up to +40% damage and gain a huge showdown advantage. https://i.imgur.com/1MU8UyZ.jpg New Zombie Resurrections The third and final zombie change is a bit controversial, but honestly great fun - if you kill another zombie, you have a 10% chance to instantly resurrect. This introduces a second way to get back in the game as a zombie. The most common and reliable method is to kill a living player, but now you have a chance of coming back from a zombie kill too! This makes playing as a zombie more exciting because you always have hope. Even when all the survivors have retreated to the safety of the red zone, you still have a chance and a way to win. Being a zombie has never been more fun - and killing zombies is now even funner. Tutorial and Better Interface The game now helps new players learn the game in various ways. There is a new tutorial option which triggers when a new player first clicks the PLAY button. This will host a special server against bots, where they only do 20% damage against you. This lets you progress through the Newbie Checklist up the top right in peace and gives a safe, lag-free, veteran-free first experience of the game. I've also added little tool tips, such as a prompt to pickup a nearby gun if you are only holding a pistol (I've noticed that new players tend to run right past guns for some reason). Also, the mechanics of the Battle Royale mode are explained better in various ways, most impressively with this sexy new victory screen that shows up each time someone wins a round. It will flash red if an enemy wins, and green if an ally wins. It also explains how the point scoring system works: https://i.imgur.com/Ceulr7z.png Major Vehicle Buffs Vehicles have had their hitpoints buffed and now have the ability to regenerate health out of combat. You also don't instantly die if your vehicle explodes, but are simply ejected out with a mere 20hp loss. To compensate for this, passengers inside a car will now take more damage (25% instead of 15%, almost double). This is a win-win both for drivers and those on-foot. Drivers can now cruise around the map without their car exploding instantly, and those on-foot can now shoot at cars without feeling like their bullets don't do anything. The whole thing is balanced a lot nicer and vehicles are now a legitimately viable form of combat. https://i.imgur.com/3ArPtXX.gif Changelog There are a few other nifty changes this version too. Such as everyone starting with 10 extra skill points. This alone is a huge improvement and allows players to really explore advanced skill builds without having to spend the first half of the round looting. A lot of focus has gone into the bots AI as well, generally making them easier, but harder in the final stages of the round - making each showdown a legitimate adrenaline pumping experience. Check out the full list below! - 10 extra skill points for everyone - Zombies now have 100hp instead of 50 - Zombies now award double the cash for kills and full XP - Killing enemies now upgrades your gun with +2% DMG (not if you're a zombie) - Reduced the damage of most guns to 90% of previous levels - Zombies now have a 10% chance or randomly resurrecting by killing another zombie - Reduced warmup round duration - Prettier and more informative text is shown after each round - Supply drops now only give 20s warning - Bots in general are easier, but superbots are harder - Bots no longer shoot you from offscreen - You can't dodge vehicles by jumping anymore, gotta shift them - In nonBR game modes, you start with a random tier1 gun - XP earned on higher diffi...",1582552843,
308600,1.24: New Conquest Mode and a Huge FPS Boost!,"New Conquest Game Mode After working on Battle Royale all year, I've decided to update the other game modes. Conquest mode in particular got a complete rework and plays MUCH better now. It's such a big rework that I'll just explain how it works from scratch and ignore the old rules completely. There are 5 control points, connected in a linear line. The scientists start at point A, and the rebels at point E. You must capture the points in order A-B-C-D-E, and the first team to control all 5 points wins. You capture a point in two ways, either by standing next to it for 30s, or by buying the Capturer chemical for $5000 and planting it on the center. Proximity capturing is the main approach, but saving up for a Capturer can be the winning move that gives your team the game. https://i.imgur.com/VbMzBpS.jpg If you own a control point you can buy from it, warp to it, and also pick up all the free cash which rains down upon it (at a rate of $1000 per minute). So far this all sounds like typical Conquest rules for a linear recapturing game mode. But here's where it gets interesting: Whenever you capture a control point, BOTH TEAMS will go onto a 60s capturing cooldown. This means that for the next 60s neither team is able to capture a point. You can speed up this cooldown by getting kills (shaving 2s off the timer per kill). This cooldown mechanic effectively creates a race scenario where the match is split up into a series of 60s rounds. It works like this: https://i.imgur.com/8oW82RF.png The scientists capture a control point, going from 3 vs 2 to 4 vs 1. Both teams are now on a 60s cooldown, and a race has begun to see which team can capture the next point. You get kills as fast as you can to advance the timer faster, and then prepare as best as you can for when the timer reaches 0s, so you can begin capturing instantly. The winner of this race will capture their point, but more importantly DENY their enemy from capturing their point, as they are put onto a cooldown again. This create intense moments where you need to work with your team to capture points as quickly and efficiently as possible or else the other team will beat you. This race mechanic really adds a sense of rhythm to the game, with alternating moments of preparation and execution, and I hope you enjoy it! https://i.imgur.com/fG78aCI.png Cash Reworks The way cash is earned in the game has changed in a few ways. In non BR modes, the passive cash income has been replaced with looting, so it behaves similar to Battle Royale. Players also get 3x as much cash for killing enemies and the kill combo system has been expanded to allow for longer and bigger combos. Cash will also now fall from the sky into the buy zones (in BR) and control points (in Conquest). These are in little $100 silver coins and fall at a rate of $1000 per minute. This makes camping/defending a viable strategy as you can stay in the one place, protecting one of these key locations and still earn an income. Performance Improvements I have spent about 2 weeks fixing my old outdated OpenGL code to make the game run significantly smoother. If you have a slow PC then this here is probably going to be the single best improvement to the game I've ever released, because the difference is like night and day. Also, the falling from the sky in Battle Royale runs a lot smoother now too! https://i.imgur.com/uRbIpC6.png Changelog Conquest has been completely reworked. 3x the amount of cash is awarded for killing enemies. Made huge performance improvements. Improved the graphics of bullets. The crosshair now indicates how much ammo you have left. New players start the game with access to more items. Light Shifting now improves the recharge time between shifts. Laser Focus has been replaced with a new skill called Adrenalin Rush which makes you move faster in combat. Flaregun now fires an explosive bullet. Increased the movement speed of all weapons in combat. Fixed a number of issues with the bots behaviour using shared chemicals. Allied chemicals now display at full size so it's easier to see their range. Non-BR game modes now give 5x as much cash in the form of loot, but have no passive income. Pressing 'E' on a bot will make him drop the flag in CTF Changed how the scoring works in nonBR modes. +1 per kill, +10 per capture, +2 for killing someone holding the flag. Significantly buffed the UZI's bullet and movement speed. Buffed the damage of the Photon Beam, Flamethrower, M3 and Barrett. Health and Mana kits now give +5 max hp instead of +25 temporary hp. The max hp is now capped at 150 instead of 200hp. Firing weapons will be disabled for 1.5s after using a warp field. Updated some translations. Fixed a bunch of bugs. 40% Discount & Merry Christmas Geneshift is of course particpating in the Winter Sale with a thicc 40% discount. Now is the time. Your time - to shine.

308600,1.23: Supply Drops & New Camera Angle!,"Supply Drops Geneshift now has supply drops! They will randomly appear in the map with a 30s countdown timer. Everyone in the server is alerted to this and has 30s to get to the area and then fight to be the last man standing to claim the prize. The prize is that a bunch of new ultra-rare loot will drop, including permanent max hp/mana upgrades, a +30% Damage weapon, +10 kill coins and possibly an entire new skill unlocked for free! These supply drops give you an excellent incentive to play agrgressively, and provide interesting king of the hill style battles. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/70ace508fb56fb94e457fb079910e089f693073b.png Zombie Improvements Zombies have been reworked in a big way this version and play a lot better. There is now stuff to actually DO as a zombie and you are much stronger as well. For starters zombie weapons now do 100% damage instead of 50%, which no longer punishes you and lets you continue playing as normal. Resurrections are much easier because of this, and easier still as there is no 20s countdown time anymore - you can resurrect as soon as you spawn. Furthermore, zombies can now keep their gun and max hp benefits when they spawn the next round. This, combined with supply drops gives you something really meangingful to fight over once dead - a chance to start with an extra high damage weapon or more max hp. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/d6c3378d8f28c96aa1c0f4f040724233e65aa109.png Tilted Camera Angle You might have noticed in the screenshots above that the camera angle has been tilted! After 10 years Geneshift has finally upgraded from a pure birds-eye shooter into an isometric shooter! Who knows, in another 10 years this might become and FPS! Eitherway, this new camera angle looks a lot nicer on the eyes, and helps you judge the height of boxes in the map as well. It makes for a far more immersive playing experience, especially combined with the other graphical upgrades. For example, Geneshift now supports 4X MSAA antialiasing and looks a lot smoother because of it. It also has updated player models, where they hold the weapons properly instead of like blockmen. There is even a new ""gore"" setting in the options menu that can significantly increase the amount of blood that comes out of baddies when you make them go splat. https://i.imgur.com/kezxF9f.png New Gameplay Twists A number of skills have been buffed, and a few have been buffed in a very interesting way - team buffing. Certain skills, such as Self Repair, Ignition Orb, Xray-Vision and Frenzy will now benefit nearby allies when you cast them, allowing for some really interesting new squad tactics. Other cool tweaks are the new looting system, where if you run over the same type of gun you not only grab its ammo, but can now upgrade the damage of your current gun by +2%. This little boost can really add up and makes looting as a zombie extra fun. https://i.imgur.com/ixh33FT.png 40% Discount Geneshift is on discount. You know how this works! If you want to support the game now would be a great time to pick it up. Also, to celebrate this new version I decided to create a cybertruck with a flamethrower attached to its forehead - enjoy! https://i.imgur.com/WNjcO5D.gif ",1575032427,
308600,1.22: Controller Support & Zombie Weapons!,"Controller Support! The most requested feature since Geneshift joined Early Access, controller support is finally here! It's been tested with Xbox and Playstation controllers, but should work with other types too. It turned out signficantly better than I expected, and I'd love to hear your opinions on it. All the hotkeys are rebindable in the options menu, but here is the default layout: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/2298ff3c9e6f5d7a25a92972c149881b568edbe6.png Zombie can use Weapons & Cars! Even more exciting is a whole bunch of improvements to how zombies work. For starters, zombies can now buy, loot and use weapons! You're no longer forced to repetitively use the zombie pests or claws. To prevent this being being overpowered, zombies will only deal 50% as much damage when using a normal weapon, and have reduced range too. Zombies can drive cars too! They've also been buffed up to 50hp instead of 30hp, and their pests weapons has been turned into a mini-shotgun that is far more tactical to play with. Overall being a zombie is a lot more fun this version because there is so much more you can do. But wait.. there's more. Zombie Resurrections Another big change is that zombies can once again resurrect by killing a player, and get back into the game. However there is a twist, which is that you need to be alive for at least 30s before resurrections are possible. This is shown as a progress bar down the bottom of the screen. This change adds a sense of survival to being a zombie, where the ideal strategy is to no longer brute-force you way to try kill an enemy player, but instead to stealthily survive for 30s, loot up with weapons and health kits, and go for a quality kill instead. It makes resurrections harder to pull off, but so much sweeter when you do. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/48343686ae1907110fb37d72ade291fd350010ee.png Share Chemicals With Allies Another huge change is that chemicals can be shared with allies. This adds all sorts of teamwork in Squads mode. You can place a Warp field and have your ally warp through it. You and your buddy can place Sonar Cells to provide shared vision on all entrances to the final circle. You can sell weapons into Alchemic Acid and split the profits, and of course you can use your friend's sneakily placed Base Chemicals to rebuy ammo. The teamwork options are huge and chemicals in general should get a lot more exposure now that you only have to do half the work to set them up. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27528347/1cefe082bb182c263b959dac2b26c2242e363c89.png Changelog Added full controller support. Zombies can now use weapons. Zombies can now use vehicles. Zombie pests reworked into a tactical shotgun that does 40hp damage per blast. Zombies now have 50 hp and mana instead of 30. Zombie claws and knife now do 50hp damage instead of 35. Active skills now cost 20/30/40/50 mana instead of 15/20/25/30. Mana regen rate is now +5 mana/s instead of +3 mana/s, Skill points now cost $2000 each instead of $3000. Translators can now edit translations in data/translations folder and test them in-game. Allies can now use eachothers chemicals. More HUD improvements, showing weapon stats and explaining how and skills trees work. Reorganised the unlocks grid to make all the chemicals much cheaper. Updated some translations. Future Plans Now that controller support is added Geneshift is really getting ready for another big marketing push. And this of course means more players! I'll update the trailer first, and then start contacting the press. Until then, have fun!",1572616828,
308600,"1.21: Friend Invites, Dynamic Music and More!","Steam Friend Invites Geneshift now has a party system! Perfect for playing with friends in Battle Royale squads. You can now invite your friends on Steam to join your party, which allows you to chat with eachother while still in the menu and organise what game to play. You can also follow the party leader into a game, which makes it much easier for friends to play in the same server. The game will also ensure you're all put onto the same squad if possible. The max party size is 4, as this matches the max squad size in both Battle Royale and the coop campaign. https://i.imgur.com/8UF0mBx.png Dynamic Music The music has received a much needed update, making it sound more badass. The old tunes were too slow for the fast-paced gameplay. Even better, the music will now dynamically change based on the action on screen! Whenever you take damage the music will gradually become more and more intense, fading in a powerful beat and drums based on the action on screen. This effect turned out way better than I expected and really gets the heart racing in times of action. It makes you focus and play at least 30% better than you would otherwise! And that is a Geneshift guarantee. https://i.imgur.com/1B7wZTA.png Survival Focused Gameplay There are some significant changes to the rules of the Battle Royale this version, which place a far greater emphasis on survival. Geneshift has always been a cross between a Battle Royale and a deathmatch, with it's series of 2 minute back-to-back rounds. But the balance was too deathmatchy, and these new changes tap into that feeling of survival that other BR's capture so well. The main change is removing the mechanic where zombie players could come back to life by killing a player. While a novel idea, it ultimately made surviving irrelevant as you could always come back after dying. Now, death is final, and if you die you'll stay as a zombie for the rest of the round. You can still loot of course, but you won't get a chance to come back and win that round. https://i.imgur.com/cuBybST.gif This is especially important because you now get a massive +20 points for winning a round, compared to the previous +5 reward. This means that you NEED to win rounds if you wanna win the game, and to do that you need to survive. There are a few other small changes that further enhance this survival vibe, such as making each round last 3 minutes instead of 2, and awarding players bonus XP over time simply for staying alive. Overall, this survival focus makes the game feel significantly more immersive, makes vehicles and chemicals far more useful as ways to stay alive, and makes round wins far more satisfying (especially when combined with the intense, new dynamic music!) https://i.imgur.com/j3Ed0pA.png New Graphics & Brighter Maps Geneshift now has a brand new logo! You might have also noticed a new header image on Steam. The HUD has also been improved, as you can see the health and mana bars are now far easier to see. The official maps have also been turned to day-time instead of night time, which is prettier and makes it easier to see enemies and game objects. https://i.imgur.com/y8hzPPf.png Changelog You can now invite Steam friends to join your party. Changed all the music in the game, and gave it dynamic intensity. New logo and new brighter new in-game graphics. Zombies can no longer resurrect by killing a living player. Rounds now last 3 minutes instead of 2. Winning a round now gives +20 points instead of +5. You get +10xp every 30s that you stay alive to reward survival. Tier 1 guns only do 75% as much damage as before. Bazooka does 400hp instead of 600hp damage, making cars far more viable. You can now choose your difficulty on the loading screen, and earn more XP for higher difficulties. Players now spawn with a USP in Battle Royale mode. Changed bot behaviour to play with a survival focus and try to avoid players. Holding TAB in-game now shows daily challenges under the minimap. Improved the health and mana bars in the HUD. Tweaked how the civilian wanted level increases, making it easier to reach level 3 then escape further attention. Guards no longer turn into zombies in the campaign. You no longer need to return souls in the campaign, simply killing zombies will do. The game no longer pauses when you open the buy menu in singleplayer PvP modes, as this is inconsistent with multiplayer. Made the ""Top 3 in Match"" daily challenge a permanent feature in the top slot, so every day you have a reason to win a game. Made some in-game graphics sync with the music, like your character will dance to it if you idle long enough. Fixed a bunch of bugs. Updated some translations. 40% Discount & Future Plans Oooohh, a discount. And oh my... it's so big! If you haven't done so yet now is a great time to pick up the game. The next things I'll focus on are making a new trailer, updating all the translations and (trying!) to add controller support.

308600,"1.20: Daily Challenges, Kill Coins, and a New Menu","It's been 3 months since the last version, but this one is worth the wait. This version completely reworks Geneshift's progression system, changing how you level up, how you unlock things, how XP is earned and more. It introduces a new currency called ""Kill Coins"" which are used to unlock items, adds the concept of ""personalised difficulty"", and features a new daily challenges system. Best of all, the menu has got a total makeover and now looks gorgeous! Check out this before and after pic! https://i.imgur.com/S0QSJwB.jpg New Menu The new menu system not only looks better but is significantly easier to navigate. There's a big play button which will auto-join you into the ideal server, daily challenges shown on the left, and every other page has been polished up too. Up the top left we see your current level and XP displayed, along with any kill coins you've earned (more on that later). Specific pages of the menu have been reworked too, such as the challenges page. The challenge page shown below not only looks swish with it's new hex layout, but changes how challenges are earned too. You can now complete any challenge adjacent to one you've already completed (in the picture below the pink are completed and the blue are able to be completed). This lets you slowly work your way down the challenge grid, and move diagonally from challenge to challenge. This is a big improvement over the previous design where if you got stuck on a challenge it would completely prevent you from claiming any challenges below it. https://i.imgur.com/Bs60t8G.png Daily Challenges Speaking of challenges, the main menu now shows 3 new daily challenges. These new challenges are a great way to earn extra XP and kill coins (yes yes, more on that later..). After you complete a challenge it will reset with a new randomly chosen challenge at 0 UTC each day. Also everyone will get the same challenges, which I'm hoping will result in some ridiculous days where everyone is exclusively using sniper rifles to try complete the ""Get 10 sniper kills"" challenge. These challenges are a lot of fun as they always give you something new to aim for each day. New XP System The XP system has been completely reworked. First of all, you can now go all the way up to level 100. Your level is shown above your head in-game and represents how much XP other players get for killing you. It's a great way to show off your progress and make others fear you, while also valuing the high XP bounty on your head. Every time you level up you will gain +15 kill coins which can be used to unlock items. The XP you earn each day is also used to compete in the daily leaderboards, and the 20 players who earn the most XP each day will receive additional kill coins. https://i.imgur.com/yqlqxkP.gif Personalised Difficulty One fun new way to earn extra XP is by playing on a harder difficulty level. This will result in facing more difficult but also higher level bots, and these higher level bots will award more XP whenever you kill them. The cool thing about this new difficulty mechanic is that it is personallised just to you, so you can choose to play on Insane difficulty, whie someone else in the server can play on Standard. This allows veteran players to have a challenge and farm bonus XP without forcing newbies to die to aimbots. Kill Coins Kill Coins are the new main currency that you can earn. They are used to unlock items which gives you the main sense of progression in the game. Items used to be unlocked with XP but this was quite confusing, as normally players don't expect to ""spend"" XP and see it go down. So now instead, XP makes you level up, and when you do that you gain +15 kill coins. You also gain kill coins for completing daily challenges and regular challenges. You also get them by topping the daily XP leadboards. https://i.imgur.com/yY167u2.gif Items are now arranged in a hexagonal grid, and like the challenges, you can only unlock an item that is adjacent to one you've already unlocked. Players can snake their way down the list, picking and choosing which items to get. This adds an element of strategy in the way you progress your account. Do you rush vertically down the list to reach the top-tier skills and weapons? Or do you unlock the significantly cheaper items up the top first? The previous version also had the concept of ""item discovery"" which has now been removed from the game. You no longer need to randomly discover an item in the map before you can unlock it (which could sometimes take forever and was frustratingly random). Now you can unlock anything as long as you've reached it in the hexagonal grid and have earned enough kill coins. Other Cool Changes There are plenty of other changes too. I'll list some of the highlights below: The game automatically logs you in when you open it. The menu background is now animated with dudes shooting at cars. Added 20 new challenges, and 30 new daily challenges. Victory points have been removed from the game. You no longe...",1567408326,
308600,1.18: Geneshift Goes GTA!,"To celebrate the 10 year anniversary since Geneshift first came online, this version is getting a big, immersive, GTA2 inspired makeover. We now have civilians, vehicle friendly maps, and even a 4-star wanted level. This version also introduces a new squad mode, player vs bots coop option, a new difficulty level, new BR mechanics, a more permissive free demo option, and more! Civilians! Geneshift now has civilians! They walk around the map on premade paths, cross the street at pedestrian crossings, chill out in the park or loiter near their favourite uhmmmm.. establishments. https://i.imgur.com/v5CVOKq.jpg Some of them drive cars and blast groovy beats out of the radio. If you fire a gun next to them they'll scream and run away. They really bring the map to life and make the game far more immersive. But best of all, they introduce a fun new mini-game that can be played alongside the main game... Civilian Aggression Inspired by the wanted level system in GTA games, you now have a ""civilian aggression rating"". This ranges from 0 to 4 stars and increases the more civilians you kill. By default civilians will ignore you, which is important as I don't want them distracting from the main gameplay. However if you choose to go on a murderous killing spree, then your rating will start to increase. As your rating increases, civilians will drop better and better loot, but they'll also become more aggressive towards you. At level 0 they ignore you. At level 1 they will attack with their fists. At level 2 they will fire back with pistols, while level 3 makes them use autos. Finally if you manage to reach level 4 (it's not easy to do) then they will go into an all out riot where every civilian in the map will swarm to your location to destroy you as soon as possible. This acts as a sort of mini-game where you can try and see how long you can survive against the mob. But what's really cool is that this is an actually viable strategy in-game. If you reach this max wanted level you will earn some seriously good loot, like the new +20% DMG purple super weapons. Also, civilians award a bit of cash when you kill them, so they give you something to farm up while running around the maps. https://i.imgur.com/7YzZN29.gif Expanded Demo User Rights Demo users (who use the demo linked on the right of the store page) now have far more options in-game. They can now actually unlock items! This is pretty huge, as they can now play Geneshift competitively 100% for free. Of course XP is still earned slower without the full game, but all items in the game can now be used given enough time. Furthermore, when you upgrade to the DLC you will now instantly double your XP, allowing you to get a bunch of cool new items. Vehicle Friendly Maps Finally for the first time in 10 years Geneshift has wide maps that are actually big enough to drive vehicles in. Before now the maps were either too small or too cramped, but as requested, I have taken the time to finally expand them. And it feels great! You can now hop into a car and just cruise all over the place. New roads have been bulldozed through buildings and annoying boxes have been removed to make for a super smooth driving experience. https://i.imgur.com/fUeYeMC.gif Battle Royale Squads Battle Royale now has a new default game mode - squads! Squads support up to 5 players, allowing for some sweet 5v5v5v5 games. Even better, these squads dynamically change size based on the number of players in the server, which lets players play co-op vs the bots. I think this will do wonders for our community and give a much better first impression to new players. Instead of joining a FFA game and getting destroyed by a veteran, they will now be placed on the same team, working together and introducing some great team play. The menu also has a new ""quick play"" button which will automatically place you into the best online server too, factoring in ping, players and game type. https://i.imgur.com/wkHUPP6.jpg Refining Battle Royale Mechanics Iteration iteration iteration. This version improves in the Battle Royale formula in a few key ways. First of all, the circle now shrinks in a more interesting way, alternating between open looting then sudden shrinking. Loot will also now drop into specific buy zone areas throughout the round as well, which encourages players to fight over key areas to gain a financial edge. The zombie's now have an updated ranged attack as well, making for interesting combat between zombies without overwhelming the remaining players. Better Bot AI & Difficulty There is a new, extremely tough, ""Ultimate"" difficulty setting for those wanting a challenge. This is especially fun to play with friends using the new Battle Royale squads mode. Bot difficulty itself has been tweaked, to make the bots generally more difficult, and especially smarter at winning rounds. You are no longer guaranteed to win every single round on Standard difficulty, and a lot of the previous exploits against bots no longer ...",1558352143,
308600,1.17: Everything Redesigned!,"It's a big one! Through constant iteration of test versions and discussions in Discord, this version has reworked almost every system in the game. There's a huge focus on usability, making mechanics intuitive to new players, and streamlining everything for the Battle Royale mode. I'll go into detail below, but here are some of the biggest changes: Every skill is reworked and actives no longer have penalties. New skills have been added to replace old/broken/weird ones. Weapons have been reworked to feel significantly more tactical. The knife is no longer a 1-shot kill, unless you charge it first. Chemicals can be bought from anywhere in the map. Chemicals can be picked up for free at any time. Cosmetics are now unlocked with XP instead of community credits. The default heal has been replaced with a passive regen. The control scheme has changed to become more usable. https://i.imgur.com/ot8DibY.gif Skill Penalties Removed The skill system has been reworked in a number of ways. The biggest change is the removal of skill penalties from active skills. Over 15 confusing and unintuitve penalties removed in a single version! Replaced with a single, simple, and easy to understand drawback - the mana you use to cast it. Much simpler. There's a new philosophy guiding how the skills behave in this version, and that is ""bigger is better"" (heh). Previously skills didn't make you more powerful because they had penalties. In some situations these penalties would actually make you weaker. While good for competitive gameplay, this was very unintuitive to new players, and not too fun either. So now skills will always make you stronger. And the more skill points you have, the stronger you become. To do this every skill in the game has been reworked, changed and simplified to make them as inutitive for new players as possible. There are also fun new skills such as X-Ray vision which lets you see through walls. Skill Tree Reworks The skill system itself has been streamlined too. For starters, you can now only unlock a maximum of 3 active skills. Before there was no limit, allowing you to get up to 15 active skills, which of course was ridiculously difficult to manage. Now with 3 only there are 3 dedicated hotkeys to use your 3 abilities (right click, C and Z). It feels MUCH easier to cast your skills without having to remember what number cast what ability. But wait, there's more! The skill trees actually do something now, because once you invest into one of the trees you are unable to invest into the others. This forces players to adopt a certain playstyle and is more similar to the hero or class-based combat seen in other games. However if you really want to multi-tree you can, but it will cost you 6 extra skill points to unlock extra trees. There are more changes too, like the ability to invest synergy points every 8 levels (which are now super powerful), and the ability to reset your skill build mid-game to experiment with different options. https://i.imgur.com/PGIWcTG.jpg The Knife is Dead I've changed how the weapons behave as well. The most important one is that knife no longer kills in 1-shot. Honestly it was silly how powerful the knife was before, but now it only does a mere 35hp damage.. unless you charge it. You can now hold the mouse down to start charging your knife, and only after doing this for 1.5s will you be able to do a full 1-shot stab. This massively nerfs knife in normal combat, but still keeps it interesting for ambushes. T-T-T-Tactical Combat Weapons have had some big sweeping changes made to them. For starters, the concepts of damage fadeoff and movement recoil are now removed. Don't know what those are? Don't worry... no one did. That's why they're removed. It wasn't intuitive enough. Weapons now do the same damage at all ranges, making combat a lot more powerful at long distance. Furthermore, weapons will now slow your enemies when you hit them, similar to the tagging system used in CS:GO. This makes combat a lot cleaner and makes cover a lot more important, because if you get hit out in the open you're a sitting duck. Chemical Convenience The chemical system is great fun if you know how to use it. But it has always been to hard to use. Well no longer. The biggest change here is that you can buy chemcials from anywhere in the map! Just press B and buy whatever chemical you want. This makes it much easier to set up a base and start building in your favorite area, as you no longer need to trek the chemical all the way across the map to place it. Also you can now hold CTRL to pick-up your existing chemicals off the ground for free. There is also a brand new chemical too called ""Goo Trap"", which will slow enemies as soon as they step inside it, making this the first combat-oritented chemical. https://i.imgur.com/WvOF23D.jpg Cosmetics Unlock with XP The old ""community credits"" system that I made back in 2010 has finally been removed from the game, and merged into the new and improved XP system. It's super ...",1554149963,
308600,1.16: Bot Difficulty Levels & Daily Leaderboards!,"New Bot Difficulty Levels This version makes your skill actually matter. Last version bots would adjust their difficulty based on your K:D ratio. This was great for new players, but uninteresting for veterans because your skill didn't really matter. You were always going to get the same K:D ratio anyway, so why try? There was also no incentive to unlock more powerful items, either. This is now fixed! Bots come in 4 new difficulty levels - Playful, Standard, Hardcore and Insane - and if you want to beat the harder bots you will have to play well. Really well. There are rewards for beating harder bots too, such as earning more XP per kill and earning more victory points per win (more on that later). When you first play you only have access to the playful bots, but as you win games you'll unlock the ability to play on higher difficulties. This gives you something to work towards and wraps the entire game up with a meaningful progression system. Higher difficulties give more XP, which makes you more powerful, which actually mattters now because the bots are harder to kill. They won't go easy on you. Most importantly, you can now have a genuine challenge and be rewarded for playing your best. https://i.imgur.com/7GLJSxj.jpg Victory Points & Daily Leaderboards You now receive ""Victory Points"" whenever you win games. These are only awarded to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd players in a match. Victory points are needed to unlock the new bot difficulty levels mentioned above. So if you want to play harder bots and earn more XP, you will need to actually win games! This all or nothing approach makes the final stages of each match far more exciting as the exclusive victory points are at stake. Even better, there is a new daily leaderboard system which ranks players based on how many victory points they have won each day. These leaderboards can be explored in-game, and the top 20 players each day will receive a bonus XP reward! You can also view previous leaderboards, allowing winners to be recognise in the game for all time! Driveby Shootings You can now shoot out the window of vehicles while driving at the same time! This buffs vehicles a lot and is just damn fun. You can also loot for items by driving over them with vehicles, which I think makes vehicles the new best thing to aim for when falling from the sky. Ch-ch-check it: https://i.imgur.com/Sx62rZH.gif Anti-Zombie Circle There's a new anti-zombie mechanic that kills zombies who try to reach the centre of the Battle Royale zone. This gives the remaining human survivors a ring of safety, and lets them focus on eachother instead of the incoming swarm of zombies. This really makes the game feel a lot more ""last man standingy"". It now comes down to a tactical heads-up between the 2 final players without zombies causing chaos all over the place. Zombie players still have plenty to do outside the circle however, such as looting for cash or placing chemicals. https://i.imgur.com/yzdRjUA.jpg Balance Changes Here are some other noteworthy changes: Zombies move faster as the anti-zombie circle prevents swarming. Players in the circle of death are now revealed in the map. Newbie Checklist now awards +300xp instead of +30xp. The leveling curve is now slower, but goes all the way up to level 50. There are 4 new late-game unlocks which permanently buff your character. The first round of the Battle Royale is pistols only. Tweaked the rates that you earn XP from awesome points and kills. Awesome points now only happen if you do something actually awesome (get a kill with a vehicle, skill, explosive, etc). Grenades now do 100hp damage. The loot drop rate now depends on the difficulty level. Higher difficulties drop more permanent loot (like skill unlocks), but less temporary loot (like free weapons). You can no longer choose which ally to duo with if they are a bot. Challenges now require a certain amount of victory points to claim, which matches up with which difficulty level you have unlocked vs bots. The crosshair is now bigger and sexier. Missions are removed from Conquest games due to too much complexity. XP is no longer affected by your kill combo as it was too exploitable. Superweapons now cost 100% to refill ammo instead of 50%. Nerfed Spike trap. Fixed a bunch of bugs. 35% Discount Geneshift will be on sale starting Monday, Feb 25th. You can fuel my chocolate addiction by buying the game for yourself or a friend!

308600,"1.15: Jump Pads, New XP System & 5 Extra Modes!","https://i.imgur.com/48HZOOY.gif Jump Pads! This version adds a new Quake-inspired feature - jump pads! Simply hop onto a jump pad and it will launch you up into the air. Jump pads come in two main flavours, horizontal and vertical. In the gif above we see horizontal ones chained together. Vertical ones are placed next to buildings and let you easily jump over walls and other obstacles. I added jump pads because I received a lot of feedback that the maps were too maze-like and hard to navigate. Especially in a turbo fast Battle Royale, the last thing you want is to get stuck in a dead-end and killed by the circle. Jump pads solve this issue. I have placed pads in all the dead ends and now it is super easy to get to the centre. So hop into the game and hop onto a jump pad! https://i.imgur.com/YnqXY2U.png New XP & Skills System I have reworked the XP system to give a new sense of progression. As you kill enemies in-game you will now earn XP, which is similar to the old ""points"" that you earned to unlock items. However this XP now has a second benefit, which is that it permanently increases the amount of skill points you start a round with. This is applied in the campaign and when playing against bots, and is an optional setting in multiplayer games. This provides a bit of an MMO mechanic. When you first create an account you will be at level 1. But as you play you'll slowly and permanently level up. After playing for a few hours you might reach level 6, which means you start each game with 6 skill points instead of 1. For convenience I've added a ""use previous skill build"" button, which instantly loads up the previous build you were using with a single click. This new system makes you feel more and more powerful as you play and lets you experiment with some fun skill builds. Before, when you started at level 1, the match ended before you had a chance to get a good skill combo going. Now you can enjoy your favourite skills all game. https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/978140/ss_2a8a047770f64b3e73c9e3ee86f01152772df3ba.1920x1080.jpg 5 New Game Modes I have unlocked all 5 additional game modes for base game players (those who don't have the DLC). Previously only DLC owners could play these, but there wasn't much point because there weren't enough players in the servers. Now everyone can play every PvP mode! The new modes are Conquest, Extraction, Checkpoint Racing, Deathmatch and Zombie Survival. Newbie Checklist Another big concern with the previous version was the lack of a tutorial. Well this has been (partially) addressed by adding the Newbie Checklist to Battle Royale. It's a little box that sits in the top-right corner of the screen and guides you step by step through all the main areas of combat. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete and can be done in-game while playing, and will teach you how to buy guns, use skills, place and destroy chemicals, and more. https://i.imgur.com/VtuuqRK.png Balance Changes I've tweaked a bunch of values based on the feedback over the past 2 months. Here are some of the major changes: I have slowed zombie movement speed so they're less overwhelming. Chemicals are significantly cheaper. Neutralizing chemicals now awards a fixed $3000. Tier2 weapons now cost $2000 instead of $3000 and have more ammo. Default round duration is 2.5 minutes instead of 2 minutes. Rearranged a bunch of challenges based on completion rates. Loot now spawns in specific areas, instead of evenly across the map. Enemies don't show on the minimap while falling in BR. The ""new item discovered"" popup box no longer distracts you in pvp servers. If you win a solo/duo BR round, you get to keep your gun for the next round. Skills are now capped at level 3 instead of level 5. Skill points can be purchased in all game modes now, not just BR. The skill queues system now works in Battle Royale. Drastically sped up the drop rates for discovering new skills and chemicals in-game. End of round awards now contribute towards your item and skill level progression. The bomb that will become the centre of the next round is now highlighted in the minimap. Self Repair skill now increases the rate you gain mana as you level it up. 25% Discount & Future Plans Next version I will be reworking the skills system and adding more depth and strategic territory control to the Battle Royale mode. I'll also continue to chip away at the long list of balance, bugs and other suggestions you guys have provided me. It's great to have a clear list of feedback to work from and I hope you guys enjoy this new version! Also, Geneshift is on sale for 25% off right now.

308600,"Reddit, Future Plans, and a Happy New Year!","So I recently posted about Geneshift on reddit and it exploded to over 64,000 upvotes! This brought thousands of new players to both the game and the Discord. There have been hundreds of positive reviews, plenty of valuable feedback, and non-stop 24/7 players online. Geneshift hasn't been this active all year! The servers crashed twice, and I got about 7 hours sleep in 3 days. It's been wild! https://i.imgur.com/Er9tj9z.gif 213,000 Concurrent Players Ok, these weren't real players. This was more of a bug/loophole with Valve's trading card system. Apparently bots were able to idle in Geneshft to collect trading cards, and this spread like wild-fire online until over 200,000 bots were idling the game at the same time. Somehow placing Geneshift on the top 10 leaderboard for the most played games on Steam.. OF ALL TIME! This is totally ridiculous and again, these are not real players, but as a single dev this just blows my mind. https://i.imgur.com/exP5MLG.jpg Future Plans The best part of all this has been the incredibly valuable feedback that I've received. People from all over the world have told me exactly what needs to be done to polish Geneshift up. I'm very proud to say that over 85% of the recent reviews have been positive and am so glad to see people enjoying the game. But there is still a lot more work to be done. I have read and responded to every single review and comment. I've been compiling a huge TODO list to start working on after Christmas and the new year. This list is massive and will be a few months of work, but it's all valuable and necessary. Here are just a few plans: Controller support A proper tutorial Special events that allow non-DLC players to enjoy other PvP modes Expanding and streamlining the maps Usability improvements Bug fixes Menu redesigns More challenges and reworking existing ones Zombie nerfs and general balancing Upgrading netcode and server stability More translations https://i.imgur.com/X5UxXS7.png Happy New Year The last few days have been crazy, and I'm still busy responding to everyone and doing tech support. I will make a few minor bug fixes over the coming days, and then it will be Christmas and NYE so I'll be busy then too. But starting in the new year I am pumped to get cracking on all your amazing feedback. This has been the best Xmas present I could have asked for and I can't thank you all enough for playing, telling your friends, writing reviews, and leaving feedback. All of this really helps our community grow. I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year! 30% Discount on the base game and Complete Edition DLC Geneshift is on sale for 30% off right now. This will last for the entire Winter Steam sale. If you want to try the other PvP modes, the singleplayer campaign, or just support the game now is a great time to pick Geneshift up. Thanks!

308600,Version 1.14: New Challenge System!,"https://i.imgur.com/qEpmAjI.gif Challenges & Rewards This version introduces a new progression system called ""Battle Royale Challenges"". There are 60 challenges to complete, starting off easy and becoming increasingly difficult as you progress through them. When you complete a challenge you'll discover a new item, such as a weapon or skill, which can be used in-game. Players are now rewarded for pulling off ridiculous stunts and impressive feats of skills. If you actually manage to knife 3 people while falling from the sky, you're gonna get rewarded for it dammit! Exclusive Items One cool feature about this new challenge system is that it changes how players discover and unlock items. Previously items would randomly spawn in the map and all a player had to do to was just pick them up. That's rather uninteresting and unsatisfying. Now however, certain items can ONLY be discovered if you complete the appropriate challenge. This gives a sense of exclusivity to certain items. If you want to use the Flamethrower you will need to complete the ""Plasma Strike"" challenge to unlock it. This is a nice way to show off to other players how much you've achieved. https://i.imgur.com/JFJnhhH.png Singleplayer Content This challenge system gives players a sense of purpose and progression while playing the new Battle Royale mode. It effectively adds dozens of hours of singleplayer content for those who wish to complete all the challenges. It also gives you something to do when fighting against bots. The challenges are fun to complete and require a lot of creative thinking, and now you'll have something to show for our efforts. Your challenge progression is also shown in-game to other players, so you can show off how much you've accomplished. Improved Graphics In other news, I've played around with the lighting engine to make the game look significantly brighter, cleaner and more colourful. There are also more particle effects and the Battle Royale circle is now blue in daytime maps to make it easier to see. Check it out! https://i.imgur.com/LP4qncc.jpg Battle Royale Reworks Based on feedback over the past 2 months I've continued to refine the new Battle Royale mode, tweaking drop rates, bot behaviour, and the cash system. One significant change is the new focus on buying your own items, relying less on random loot drops and more on smart cash management. Items have been made cheaper and cash drops have increased to make this possible, and I think it should make the game play a lot more strategic. https://i.imgur.com/h7HVD2ag.png Complete Edition DLC You may notice that Geneshift now has a ""Complete Edition DLC"". This is in preparation for the full release sometime next year, but for now doesn't really change anything. Everyone who previously owned Geneshift gets this DLC for free. Anyone who buys the game during the sale this week also gets the DLC for free. Right now it's simply a way to separate the Battle Royale from the rest of the game. 30% Discount Geneshift is on sale for 30% off right now. Get it while it's hot!

308600,Version 1.13: Battle Royale Duo Partnerships!,"https://i.imgur.com/BmhSzw0.gif Duo Partnerships Everything is better with a friend. Just one ally is all you need to get that magical splash of teamwork - and that is exactly what this new version does! This version introduces a new server type for Battle Royals called ""Duos"", where you play with a friend in a 2v2v2v2v2. First team to 30 points wins! I added this after noticing that friends were playing together in FFA and purposefully not killing eachother. Up until they were the final 2, that is, then they had to stab eachother in the back. Now however you can share a victory condition and truly have your buddies back. You will share vision with eachother, see eachother's chemicals, and can heal eachother too. The game will automatically pair human players together, but you can choose a specific ally in-game by holding ALT. If you pair up with a bot you can even control them by pinging into the map! https://i.imgur.com/2BGf1NQ.png Barrier Replaced with Healing The barrier that protected you when you held CTRL has been removed and replaced with the Self Repair healing skill. That is to say, holding CTRL will now heal you instead of merely reducing incoming damage! Because of this change I have reworked and replaced a few skills that depended on the old barrier mechanic. This is a pretty big change and might make a few skills unbalanced.. but it's a necessary fix that makes the game more elegant and easier to play. One less key to remember, right? This is the benefit of getting new players into the game and listening to their feedback - they point out glaring issues that had gone unnoticed by me this whole time. Bunch of Polishing I've also done a bunch of polishing based on feedback on the new Battle Royale mode. You can now pick up loot while driving a car. Bots are signifcantly smarter, including hunting as a pack in the new Duos mode. I've removed any Pay2Win restrictions on demo users, making for a fair playing field. You can now increase the amount of phase shifts with the new light shifting skill. Lots of fun! https://i.imgur.com/GUNPCZI.png Marketing and What's Next In general, it's been a pretty good 2 weeks for Geneshift since Battle Royale was launched. We've had articles written on Rock Paper Shotgun, PC Gamer, and a 33k upvoted post on reddit! New players seem to really enjoy the Battle Royale mode, and with their valuable feedback this version really polishes everything up. I'm now ready to get start emailing streamers and youtubers and reach a wider audience. Stay tuned!",1539228229,
308600,Pressed for time? Geneshift's new battle royale mode has two-minute rounds,"GTA-inspired top-down shooter <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/308600/Geneshift/"" target=""_blank"">Geneshift</a> was released in 2017, after Ben Johnson spent nearly a decade developing it. Last month Johnson <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/96gjbk/i_just_spent_the_last_6_hours_making_the_worlds/"" target=""_blank"">joked on Reddit</a> about making a battle royale mode for Geneshift with rounds that lasted only 20 seconds, and based on the positive response he decided to make it a reality. Ultimately, 20 seconds proved to be a little <em>too </em>quick, so Johnson decided to make the rounds in what he calls &apos;Battle Royale Turbo&apos; a bit longer: two minutes. You can watch the trailer above. As you can see, all the elements of battle royale are there: dropping onto the map, looting for gear, lots of vehicles and weapons, and the closing circle of death&#x2014;but it all happens in 120 seconds. But there&apos;s even more to it than that: if you&apos;re killed, you can respawn as a zombie instead of just spectating. You&apos;ll have limited health and a single melee attack, but if you kill another player while zombified you&apos;ll be able to return to the match as a human. Zombies are also immune to the death-circle, so you&apos;ll be able to travel in and out of it at will. Geneshift&apos;s battle royale mode also includes a cash system, special abilities, and skills that progress while you play. There&apos;s a free demo you can find on <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/308600/Geneshift/"" target=""_blank"">its Steam page</a>, and if you want to know more about the development of Geneshift, <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/meet-the-indie-dev-who-spent-two-years-making-a-game-in-youth-hostels-abroad/"">we spoke to Johnson about it last year</a>.

It s got some twists that set it apart from your Fortnites and Plunkbats, too, like each round lasting only two minutes. You can get a feel for the action in the trailer below: <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/29/geneshifts-top-down-two-minute-battle-royale-is-available-now/#more-596087"" class=""more-link""> (more&hellip;) </a> ",1538226018,
308600,Version 1.12: Battle Royale Turbo Released!,"https://i.imgur.com/6KBRt0t.gif This is the biggest version of Geneshift yet and plays like a whole new game! This new mode has all the usual features of a Battle Royale: orbital drops, looting, a shrinking circle of death, and last man standing. But there are a few unique twists on the BR genre too. The main one being that each round is only two minutes long! New Trailer Check out this brand new trailer showing off some of the cool new features in this mode, including orbital drops, looting and a sexy, orange, shrinking circle of death. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaVP1udAiVk Two Minute Rounds In this Battle Royale each round only lasts two minutes. You spawn in the air, fly to a safe location, and begin looting for weapons, skills, health kits and more. The circle is constantly closing in, creating a sense of urgency and pushing you towards the big show-down in the centre. Two minutes worked best in our testing. It gives you just enough time to loot, but not so much that you feel like you're in a walking simulator. The winner of each round gets +10 points (and +1 point per kill) and the first player to 50 points wins. https://i.imgur.com/RuV91Yt.png Zombie Respawning Another twist is that when you die you don't get kicked back into the menu lobby. How boring! Instead, you respawn as a zombie with only 30hp and a melee attack. If you actually manage to kill a remaining player, you will respawn as a human and be back in with a chance to win the round! Being a zombie also makes you unaffected by the circle of death. This means you can loot for rare skills, chemicals, and cash in areas that are unsafe for humans to travel. You have something productive to do while the round is going on, and can set yourself up to do better in future rounds. https://i.imgur.com/vmzFQ6K.gif Looting & Item Progression This mode completely changes Geneshift because of looting, and it actually makes the game FAR more accessible for new players. Geneshift has always had a complexity problem. With over 30 skills to read, new players were overwhelmed with too much choice and information. This new looting system solves this by restricted access to items. You can only unlock a skill after you have discovered it, which means that you learn how to play the game GRADUALLY. This also gives a great sense of progression, where you get excited to discover a new item and see what new skill you've unlocked. Big GTA2 Style Maps Another thing I love about this mode is that it's able to use the massive GTA2-like maps from the campaign. If you've only played the multiplayer, you'll really enjoy running around these massive new maps. The vehicles and chemicals play great on them and really give a big open-world, survival experience. Talking of vehicles and chemicals, it's really interesting to see how they behave with these new BR mechanics. Vehicles are a great way to escape the circle if you get trapped while looting. They'll provide just enough speed and protection to get you to safety. Meanwhile, chemicals like Warp Field give you the ability to teleport to the single, central buy zone. This lets you spend your cash on ammo and prepare for the final showdown. https://i.imgur.com/BmhSzw0.gif Marketing and What's Next This is the mode that Geneshift shall be known for. It's so much easier for new players and streamers to get into the game without being overwhelmed. So now that this is out I'm officially shifting gears into 100% marketing mode. We're going to start having a lot of streams and players, and I couldn't be more excited! A big thanks to everyone who has helped develop this mode in the Discord. Now it's time to play!",1538180987,
308600,Geneshift is getting a Battle Royale mode,"Alright internet, you win. Geneshift is hopping on the BR bandwagon and I'm pumped! https://i.imgur.com/80l1Ccp.gif The reason I'm making this mode is because of this gif, and this 5800 upvoted reddit post. I spent an afternoon chucking together this mock-up Battle Royale circle to see how it would play, then posted it on reddit. The response was overwhelmingly positive with hundreds of people saying I should make it and they'd buy it. So let's do it! How it Will Work I'm still working out the details in the Discord and this Steam forum post. But here's what we have so far. The game will consist of multiple rounds. You get +1 point for a kill, +10 points for being the last man standing. First player to 100 points wins. Looting Each new round will start with you falling from the sky at a random location in the map. You'll be armed with nothing but your knife, and will have to loot for unlocks. You'll loot for ammo, weapons, health kits, cash, phasers, skills, vehicles, experience points and more. All the unlocks in the campaign basically. You run around, looking for the best weapons possible, and leveling up your mutant with skills and extra phase shifts. Respawning Eventually you come across an enemy. You shoot, you kill. You come across another enemy, and this time you die. Unlike in PUBG, you actually get to respawn, but you'll come back as a zombie only capable of melee attacks. If you manage to kill a real human you get a second chance at life. Big GTA2 Style Maps Each round will only last about 2 minutes, with the circle rapidly shrinking. We will be playing on the maps from the campaign, because they are bigger and have a lot more space to hide and explore. Imagine playing on a huge map like this. True GTA2 style! https://i.imgur.com/e69EHf3.png Simple and Streamable One reason why I'm so keen to make this mode is because it's an opportunity to remake Geneshift's multiplayer in a far simpler way. I love me some Conquest mode but it is admittedly quite overwhelming. The buy menu, the skills menu, there's over 80 things you can unlock. New players and streamers get confused. This new mode however will remove the buy menu and the skill menu. You have to loot for items one by one, meaning you can learn as you go. This new mode should make a great first impression for new players, and hopefully will be fun to watch youtubers play as well. 30% Discount Thought I'd quickly mention that Geneshift is currently 30% off. Now that the campaign is done and I'm adding all this new content I might bump the price up to $15 soon, so now would be a cheap time to grab the game. Anyway I hope to get this new version out within a month, so stay tuned!",1534128226,
308600,Version 1.11: PvP Finally Playable With Bots!,"All hail our robot overlords! This is perhaps the biggest version of Geneshift ever released. Why? Because multiplayer just became playable! Fancy that.. making a game that you can actually PLAY. Crazy! Previously if you joined an empty server there was nothing to do except run around a bit and shoot at boring, dumb gangsters. There was no challenge, no objective, no game. But just like in real life, AI has come to save the day. These new bots are designed to play just like real players. They'll drive cars, level skills, place chemicals, capture objectives, and even shit-talk you. They're smart, use teamwork, and will give you a real challenge. It honestly feels like playing a regular PvP game. Half the time you won't even notice you're playing against a cold, heartless, silicon-fearing robot. They play a hell of a lot better than your average human, that's for sure. https://i.imgur.com/R8EXnxI.png How Bots Work Bots replace the old gangsters, and are meant to act and play just like real players. You can configure how many of them will play in the server. As real humans join and leave the server, the bots will disappear and reappear to replace them. This way you can ensure there is always a perfectly full and balanced 10 player game running at all times. Bots play like humans and also follow the exact same rules as humans. They earn cash in the same way that humans do, and must manage their money to save up for super weapons and chemicals. They deal and take the same amount of damage as real players, with no hidden modifiers. They also do not cheat. They can't see through walls. They won't try to neturalize your chemicals unless they actually SAW you place the chemical. I've even simulated a hazy sort of memory that fades over time. I've really tried to make them play as similar to real humans as possible. https://i.imgur.com/fvZRe3I.png Dynamic Difficulty Bots adjust their level of difficulty to make for a fun game. The skill of a bot is mostly determined by reaction time and accuracy. Their accuracy will go up and down depending on how well their opponent is playing. They have a target K:D ratio that they want to maintain, and this ensures that every game is a fun, healthy challenge. A brand new player to the game can fight the bots and they'll naturally go easy on him. A veteran can fight bots and they'll 720 Tony Hawk Pro Skater no-scope him as soon as things start getting too easy. In general when fighting against bots alone you should end up with a K:D ratio around 2:1 or so. Keep in mind that even though your K:D vs bots is guaranteed to be good, you are still going to be challenged. You might be getting more kills, but your allied bots will play worse to compensate. You get to carry your team somewhat, but with great power comes great responsibility. You'll genuinely have to fight to beat the enemy team from capturing the objectives. And of course you'll still have to fight other players. https://i.imgur.com/LxlfaAl.png Graphical Improvements In other news, I've made a number of sexy graphical improvements this version. I've added atmospherics like light rays and floating bits of dust that give the game a real 3D effect. Firing guns is far more satisfying with sexy new particle effects, debris, blood and muzzle smoke. Bullets now glow and look extra chunky too. New Multiplayer Features I've also copied a bunch of features from the campaign across to the PvP modes. The kill combo system from the campaign now also applies when fighting against bots/humans and awards you a bit of extra cash for getting combo kills. Awesome points also occur in multiplayer now, and give you +50xp as well as +2 phasers for the rest of your life. You'll occassionally get a free hp/mana drop when killing enemies too. And also killing an enemy with a chemical now causes the same chemical explosion effect as seen in the campaign. General balancing A beautiful side benefit of bots is that we can really playtest the game now. In our latest test build we discovered that Bionic Gas, Lasing Orb and Self Repair were OP af. So they have been nerfed with the power of a thousand keystrokes (or at least like.. 20). Self Repair now auto disables once you reach max health too. And a few more tweaks that I can't remember. https://i.imgur.com/eNlAt6R.jpg Marketing Plans The only thing more fun to fight than these new smart bots is actual players. And now that this version is out I am officially switching gears into 100% marketing mode. The campaign is done, the PvP is finally playable, and it's time to spread the word. So stay tuned over the next few weeks as I start emailing youtubers, posting memes on le reddit and finding other ways to get players into this game.

308600,1.10: Campaign Done & Awesome Points!,"Well that took longer than expected. We've been in Early Access for over a year now, and I've only just completed reworking the singleplayer campaign. This version polishes the final 4 stages, updating them with all the cool improvements I've made over the past year. There are story rewrites too. The completion of the campaign marks a huge turning point in the development of Geneshift, as I'll be shifting focus back onto multiplayer and marketing after this. It also makes my self-diagnosed OCD happy that it took a nice, clean 10 versions to rework the campaign. https://i.imgur.com/2u5OvEv.png Awesome Points and Cash Drops How will you know the new campaign is awesome? Because the game will constantly remind you whenever you do something cool. My favorite thing about this version (apart from the relief of finally finishing the campaign) are awesome points. Awesome points are awarded when you perform extra well during combo kills, and give you XP and a skill-point or a phaser. This gif below shows them in action, as well as the new cash drop animation. Cash no longer drops on every single kill, but instead happens randomly about 30% of the time. This means you earn far less cash during the campaign, and really makes every kill and every dollar far more valuable and necessary to survive. https://i.imgur.com/KWUPEed.gif Better Skill Balancing You now have the ability to buy skill points in the campaign for $2000 a pop. This, combined with the buffing of a bunch of skills, adds a lot of flavour to the game. You can also level skills all the way up to level 5 now, allowing for some fairly ridiculous skill combos. Awesome points also award skill-points too. With all of this, I've reworked a bunch of skill values (see the changelog below) to ensure that all skills are useful and the more points you invest into the skill, the better it becomes. https://i.imgur.com/oyw9Z9u.jpg Permanent and Ranked Servers for Demo Users I have changed the permissions for demo users, allow them to now play in permanent and ranked servers. This is done for the benefit of paying players, as these servers will now become more populated. Permanent servers are one of Geneshift's most unique multiplayer features, and now we'll be able to enjoy them again! https://i.imgur.com/coYRP1F.gif New Trailer & Marketing Plans To celebrate 1 year in Early Access and the completion of the campaign, I've created a new trailer showing off all the new features added so far. Check it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOV0gG9CXcE Now that the campaign is done it's marketing time. I'm finally happy for gamers to see the game. So over the coming weeks expect to see more players in the servers. I'm going to be sending emails to relevant youtubers and try get some love from them. If you want to invite your friends to play the free multiplayer in the demo, now would be a great time! Have fun and please give me feedback here or in Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/geneshift Changelog GENERAL CHANGES Massively reworked the final 4 stages of the campaign. Community Credits now get +200 for buying the game and +50 for adding a reference. Demo users can now join Permanent matches and Ranked servers. You can now purchase skill points in the campaign for $2000 each. Reduced the cost of many campaign unlocks. Improved the graphical effects of collecting cash from guards. Long custscenes can now be skipped by pressing ESC in-game. Synergies have been removed from the campaign, allowing you to level straight up to level 5 with normal skill points. You no longer lose $200 whenever you die. Instead you gain $500 if you complete a stage without dying. Holding middle mouse now opens the skill rose and defaults to selecting instead of auto casting. It also pauses the campaign. GAMEPLAY CHANGES Awesome Points now occur when you do something awesome, awarding +300xp and a phaser or a skill point. Guards now drop cash only 1/3rd of the time. Making cash a lot more rare and valuable. The kill combo system has slightly new multiplier values and a longer timer (4s instead of 3s). Guards occassionally drop health and mana, healing you for +50hp. This happens about 10% of the time. Mana no longer regenerates up to 20 mana in stealth. Barrier mana burn is now 2 mana/s instead of 3 mana/s. Guards now do about 50% more damage, though there is a smarter dynamic difficulty system in place. Playful guards now have 100hp instead of 50, but their damage is 50% less instead. Superweapons now only cost $5000 instead of $10000, but have half as much ammo in PvP modes. SKILL CHANGES Force Field explosion damage now ranges from 60 to 40 instead of 60 to 20. Venom Shot has been flipped from levels 1 to 5. Venom Shot damage vs guards is now x4 instead of x3 (ensuring it does enough to kill). Venom Shot mana cost is now 15 instead of 20. Vampirism now restores mana against guards ranging from 2% to 6%.

All the coolest moments in the campaign have been given a bit of slow motion just to make you feel extra badass. There is literally no point to this feature. Check it out in this gif below: https://i.imgur.com/JVoyeo4.gif Smart Vehicle Camera Talk about efficient gif usage! The animation above also shows off the new vehicle camera. Your vehicle is no longer fixed in the very centre of the screen. Instead, the camera will now shift forward slightly, allowing you to see further ahead and plan where you're going to turn next. This feature has been requested for a long time and really makes driving easier. AI Vision Barriers This is a pretty big addition, and something I've needed for a long time. There are now green barriers that block AI vision. They're effectively doors that enemy guards cannot see through. They will disable if you shoot or walk through them, but until then you are free to observe your enemy and plan your attack before the shit hits the fan. In the gif below you can see the guard walk past, and only after the door is disabled does he spot me. https://i.imgur.com/WwRgDLg.gif Residence Reworks Yet another map has been polished up with all the new features added over hte past 10 months. Residence, S04 starts off with a sexy slow motion vehicle sequence (as shown in the gif above), and has been polished from start to finish. Next version will focus entirely on the rest of the campaign, and finally finish up a years worth of work redoing the singleplayer. Anyway that's all for this version. Have fun and please give me feedback here or in Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/geneshift",1524646704,
308600,"1.08: Phase Shifting, Car Boosting and AI Driving!","Self Driving Cars Step aside Google, Geneshift now has self driving cars! That's right, cars can now be driven by bots. This has allowed me to add a bunch of cool new sections to the campaign, including escort missions, chase sequences and general man vs car combat. Get your bazookas ready cause you'll have a lot of cars to shoot! Check out this sweet totally unscripted gif: https://i.imgur.com/fZiiag5.gif Phase Shifting Why walk when you can run? Why run when you can shift!? I've added a great new feature called Phase Shfting that makes movement way more tactical. Simply tap the shift key and you will now blink forward in an instant, dodging enemy grenades, escaping to cover, or charging in at your enemy with a knife. In PvP each player has 3 shifts, and can use them all up to get instant bursts of speed. After using a shift it will take 2 seconds to replenish, so you need to time them well. This new system is a lot of fun, and best of all, the title ""GeneSHIFT"" finally makes sense, as shifting is now a key mechanic in the game. https://i.imgur.com/04Hj8DH.gif Car Boosting Ok so we already had car boosting, but now it LOOKS awesome. Like actual fire comes out the back of your car. I've also made the boost mechanic a lot tighter. Your boost bar only lasts 3s now, but you get some real speed because of it. This is better than the old boost which lasted forever but barely increased your speed at all. That was more of a general speed increase, but now boosting really feels like a tactical maneuver. It sounds awesome too. https://i.imgur.com/ZnmVS6u.gif Downtown Reworks This version continues the slow but steady polishing of the campaign. Downtown (map 3) now joins Laboratory and Subway as being fully polished up with all the new features I've added over the last few versions. It focuses especially on vehicle combat using the new AI driving, and starts with a very groovy escort mission. In fact escort missions are now actually possible, as you can now fail a stage when AI characters die. This allowes for timed challenges and a bunch of other fun things.

308600,1.07: New Progression System,"In the not so wise words of EA, this version will give you a sense of pride and accomplishment. How you ask? By completely reworking the progression system. This new system adds strategy, gives cash a purpose, and lets you personalize your character as you progress through the game. Holy buzzwords batman, let's read on! https://image.prntscr.com/image/IZU3PT9fR62bXmj7zRQ8GA.jpeg New Progression System The old system was very simple. You discovered an item in the map and from that point on you could access it in the buy menu. This was great and all, but it meant that everyone had the exact same build. You were progressing, but it wasn't customizable and there wasn't any strategy or excitement to it. This new system adds a simple step that fixes this. When you discover an item in the map it becomes ""discovered"", but now it is not immediately unlocked. To fully unlock it you must actually buy it in the menu screen shown above. You buy it with cash earned from the campaign. This single change makes the progression system a lot more interesting: 1) Cash now has long term value as it is needed to progress. This gives you an incentive to get those sick combo kills, and also introduces an ""end game"" grinding stage for completionists. 2) Your build is now personalized and requires strategy. Do you spend your remaining $8000 unlocking the M4A1 or Force Fields? 3) You can now get excited about cool items. Before you were just given Invisibility before you even knew what it did. There was no anticipation. Now you'll actually care when you finally invest the $20,000 required to unlock it. https://i.imgur.com/OoRZrmN.jpg Sexy HUD Stuff Check out this cool new STAGE CLEAR thingy. It shows up when you kill the last enemy on each stage and makes you feel like a badass. I've also made the HUD a bit cleaner and given everything a sci-fi blue tint.

I should have done this earlier, because it looks great and first impressions are oh so important. We've also got some nice changes to the campaign and yet another new combo kill system. https://i.imgur.com/NIMaEKh.png New Menu System The menu has been reworked in a few ways. The overall aesthetic has been improved with a cool new blue background and new textures. The actual navigation has been changed too, with a dedicated main menu which lets you go into and out of the individual pages. This results in far fewer buttons on the screen at one time and is less overwhelming to new players. Even the options menu has been resdesigned with a new ""common options"" page that hides most of the advanced settings that no one cares about. https://i.imgur.com/7yiAHju.png New Kill Combo System (for the 4th time now?) I've yet again reworked the Kill Combo system, but I think I've got it perfect this time. There is no longer any confusing cash multiplier step that indirectly affects how much money you get per kill. The new system simply gives you extra cash directly. Instead of a double kill increasing you multiplier by 20% so that future kills give more cash, now a double kill just straight up gives you $150 for a kill instead of $100. Easy! There is still the concept of ""special kills"" which also award extra cash, and if you combo these together you get more money faster. Kills must be made within 3s of eachother to increase the combo. Here are some examples: Normal Kill: $100 Road Kill: $150 Stealth Kill: $150 Double Kill: $100, then $150 Double Road Kill: $150, then $250 No Skill Level Restrictions In the campaign there are no longer level restrictions when you unlock skills. This means you can now unlock high level skills like Teleportation at level 1! Before you had to wait till you reached level 10 to be able to do this, so with this change these skills are FAR more useful. I'm curious to see how this affects speedruns. https://i.imgur.com/OuUsqk9.png New Animated Barricades In the screenshot above you can see two barricades blocking off the top doors. This is a new feature that replaces the old doors that were hacked together with models. These are better not only because they're animated and sound cool, but because they go down into the ground when they're closed. The old models stayed the same but simply because walkable, which made it really hard to tell if you could go through them or not. Change Log General Changes The menu has been reworked, graphically and with a new naviation system. The options menu features a new ""common options"" section that hides away most of the advanced settings. There are now three presets in the options menu that easily adjust your graphical settings. Tweaked a bunch of text and fonts throughout the menu system. Campaign Changes Skills can now be unlocked at any level in the campaign. Help Text is now shown as a separate popup down the bottom of the screen, instead of being spoken by guards. A new animated barricade type exists to replace some of the old doors, making it clearer if you can or cannot pass through. The Kill Combo system has been reworked, now rewarding extra cash for special and combo kills directly. On each stage players can now compete for the total cash earned in the stage, rather than compete over the highest cash multiplier (which no longer exists). The loading screen between campaign stages now has animated text to build suspense when you see your end of round stats. Made some general tweaks to Laboratory and Subway.

308600,1.05: Exploding Guards and Resizing Maps!,"Plenty of new features! In the campaign we have a new exploding guard type who alerts nearby enemies, we have a fun new kill combo system, and the skill penalites have all been removed as well! In multiplayer we have a massive rework to how barrier works, and maps that resize based on the number of players in the server. https://i.imgur.com/JTIpYco.gif Exploding Guards Some guards will now walk with a red backpack filled with explosives chemicals. If you kill them they explode in a dazzling fireworks display, creating a sound that alerts nearby enemies. This new guard type is currently only in the first 2 stages of the campaign, but will allow me to create a variety of awesome puzzles and high adrenalin sequences where the shit hits the fan the moment you explode one of these guards. New Kill Combo System The gif above also shows the new kill combo system, showing a new ""Double Kill"" type as the grenade kills both guards simultaneously. Double Kills (along with Triple, Quad and Multi Kills) are a new kill type that rewards you with extra cash. This is done with the new cash multiplier system, which goes up when you perform ""skillful"" kills. The cash multiplier stays at x1.0 unless you do something cool. If you get a double kill, it will jump up to x1.2. If you then get a road kill it will increase futher to x1.3. This means that any kill you get will pay out $130 instead of $100. You are rewarded with more cash for killing in awesome ways, and there are other new kill types as well, such as Skill Kills, Quick Kills, and Stealth Kills. https://i.imgur.com/vAcgxsH.png Resizing Maps Maps will now resize based on the number of players in the server. When there aren't many players in the server, blue electricity will cover the ground the outsides of the map and kill anyone who walks into it. This forces players to stay in the centre, effectively shrinking the map size and resulting in far more active and fast-paced battles when playing in a smaller server. Jumping Indicators In the screenshot above you can also see some blue highlights on the boxes to the right. This new feature indicates if a box is of a jumpable height or not, and makes it much easier to jump in a 3D environment with a top-down view. Barrier Rework Barrier is a fundamental part of combat, especially multiplayer combat, and so this rework changes a lot. Barrier no longer absorbs damage into your mana pool. Instead it has been simplified to a simple 25% damage reduction at the price of slower movement and -3 mana/s. This change makes barrier more useful as you'll no longer lose all of your mana in an instant when damaged. It also ensures that you never die with ""unused mana"" which was a kinda silly way to die with the old system. No Skill Penalties In the campaign there are no skill penalties. This is pretty huge, and should make it a lot more exciting to discover new skills and mutation vials, as they are nothing but 100% benefit now. I've also made this option available for PvP servers for shits and giggles (though it will probably be pretty unbalanced). https://i.imgur.com/QguSNbw.jpg Change Log General Changes Skill Penalties are now optional in PvP servers. Blood is a lot more gorey. The game now uses a new default font, instead of boring ungamey arial. Dedicated campaign servers now reset to standard difficulty if the server is empty. Neutralizing is no longer required by the Newbie Checklist. Spectating will default to a player instead of free-look mode now. Cash bubbles now occur where you kill your enemy rather than floating above your head, making the cash rewards easier to see. Capturers now display with a blue smoke instead of red. Text bubbles now animate the text, instead of displaying it all at the same time. There's now a little bit of screen recoil whenever you shoot. Sprint speed is now 160% instead of 150%. Campaign Changes Skills no longer have penalties in Stealth mode. Guards now show a little exclaimation mark above their heads when they're first alerted. You will take a $200 penalty whenever you die. The bomb explosion can't destroy a vehicle if player is inside it. Dying in co-op during a zombie phase switches you to zombie (instead of just sitting there watching). Guards turn speed is now a bit slower.

308600,1.04: Geneshift Miami!,"This version is inspired by the extremely challenging and awesome shooter, Hotline Miami. I've completely reworked the campaign by adding a new checkpoint system and increasing enemy damage by over 500%! http://i.imgur.com/J3kDIl4.png 5x More Guard Damage Guards in the campaign now deal 5x as much damage as they did last version. They've gone from 20% damage up to the full 100% damage that players do in multiplayer. This obviously makes the campaign a lot more difficult, but it plays much better because of it. You really need to play tactically to survive now, as every mistake will be punished. The old damage values were designed to make Geneshift a more casual, relaxed experience. It was noob friendly, but in hindsight that wasn't the way to go. Multiplayer is brutal and kills you endlessly, and the singleplayer should do the same. So taking inspiration from Hotline Miami's instant 1-shot kill approach, Geneshift just got a whole lot tougher. You'll die a lot more often now, but this just makes each new checkpoint all the more satisfying to reach. http://i.imgur.com/3raOLLu.png New Checkpoint System There's also a new checkpoint system that fundamentally changes how the game is played - dying now makes you lose progress and go back to the previous checkpoint. On the ground there are little yellow checkpoint symbols that save the game state when you walk into them. If you then die, you will go back to the yellow checkpoint and lose ALL your progress since then. This change was also inspired by the checkpoint resets in Hotline Miami. This is a really huge change. Previously, when you died you would simply respawn a bit back and not lose any progress at all. Any guards you killed would stay dead, and you could simply run forward again and pick up where you left off. While this was nice and friendly to a casual player, it really took a lot of the challenge out of the game and made death feel a bit meaningless. This new system penalizes death a whole lot more, and combined with the 500% damage increase is really brutal. Dying will lose all your progress since the last checkpoint, so if you're pinned down with only 20hp remaining, you're really going to try as hard as you can to survive. The new checkpoint system also affects how co-op is played, as dying in co-op now puts you into spectator mode. You'll respawn only when you friend dies or reaches the next checkpoint. This change is needed to preserve the all or nothing challenge the new checkpoint system provides, rather than letting co-op players just constantly respawn and push forward without any real fear of death. http://i.imgur.com/cgu7Gax.jpg Chinese Translation Incoming I've also been working with a friend to add a Simplifed Chinese translation to the game. Many years ago during the beta Geneshift had a strong Chinese community, and I'm excited to finally give Chinese gamers a proper translation. The translation isn't ready yet, but I hope to release it in a few versions time. When this happens we'll see plenty of activity in the multiplayer servers, so let's make sure to welcome the new Chinese community. The more players the better! Exploding Heads and Bubbly Text Bubbles There are a few more fun things in this version, such as enemy heads will now fly off when you kill them, creating some funny death physics. Also text bubbles have a bit more personality when they pop up, wobbling like they were in a game of Candy Crush or something. Anyway I'm very excited to see your thoughts on the new Hotline Miami inspired gameplay. Enjoy!",1502855331,"['auto_migrated', 'hide_library_overview', 'hide_library_detail']"
308600,1.04: Geneshift Miami!,"This version is inspired by the extremely challenging and awesome shooter, Hotline Miami. I've completely reworked the campaign by adding a new checkpoint system and increasing enemy damage by over 500%! http://i.imgur.com/J3kDIl4.png 5x More Guard Damage Guards in the campaign now deal 5x as much damage as they did last version. They've gone from 20% damage up to the full 100% damage that players do in multiplayer. This obviously makes the campaign a lot more difficult, but it plays much better because of it. You really need to play tactically to survive now, as every mistake will be punished. The old damage values were designed to make Geneshift a more casual, relaxed experience. It was noob friendly, but in hindsight that wasn't the way to go. Multiplayer is brutal and kills you endlessly, and the singleplayer should do the same. So taking inspiration from Hotline Miami's instant 1-shot kill approach, Geneshift just got a whole lot tougher. You'll die a lot more often now, but this just makes each new checkpoint all the more satisfying to reach. http://i.imgur.com/3raOLLu.png New Checkpoint System There's also a new checkpoint system that fundamentally changes how the game is played - dying now makes you lose progress and go back to the previous checkpoint. On the ground there are little yellow checkpoint symbols that save the game state when you walk into them. If you then die, you will go back to the yellow checkpoint and lose ALL your progress since then. This change was also inspired by the checkpoint resets in Hotline Miami. This is a really huge change. Previously, when you died you would simply respawn a bit back and not lose any progress at all. Any guards you killed would stay dead, and you could simply run forward again and pick up where you left off. While this was nice and friendly to a casual player, it really took a lot of the challenge out of the game and made death feel a bit meaningless. This new system penalizes death a whole lot more, and combined with the 500% damage increase is really brutal. Dying will lose all your progress since the last checkpoint, so if you're pinned down with only 20hp remaining, you're really going to try as hard as you can to survive. The new checkpoint system also affects how co-op is played, as dying in co-op now puts you into spectator mode. You'll respawn only when you friend dies or reaches the next checkpoint. This change is needed to preserve the all or nothing challenge the new checkpoint system provides, rather than letting co-op players just constantly respawn and push forward without any real fear of death. http://i.imgur.com/cgu7Gax.jpg Chinese Translation Incoming I've also been working with a friend to add a Simplifed Chinese translation to the game. Many years ago during the beta Geneshift had a strong Chinese community, and I'm excited to finally give Chinese gamers a proper translation. The translation isn't ready yet, but I hope to release it in a few versions time. When this happens we'll see plenty of activity in the multiplayer servers, so let's make sure to welcome the new Chinese community. The more players the better!

308600,1.03: Camera Zooming!,"Version 1.03 introduces a brand new aiming system. You can now zoom the camera way out, showing a lot more of your surroundings. This gives you more situational awareness and makes aiming feel smoother too! http://i.imgur.com/WJz3PU0.gif Subway Reworks I've also completely reworked SubwayS02, adding 2 new vehicle sections and an interesting new ""Hotline Miami"" inspired section as well. The guards in this section wear red clothing and deal MUCH more damage. This requires more precise, tactical skill to take them out. Many people have compared Geneshift to Hotline Miami, and it is indeed a great game, so I'm going to be adding more of these high damage sections in future versions. Feedback is welcome on this new type of enemy! Rotating Camera There's also a new rotating camera view, which applies when driving vehicles. Some people get motion sick from it though, so I've made it optional and off by default. Still, it's pretty fun to mess around with, and makes for a more immersive driving experience! http://i.imgur.com/fa6NhL4.gif Bug & Balance Fixes There are a bunch of bug fixes and performance tweaks. I've fixed one really silly bug that was causing some paying customers to see the demo version, and made a huge improvement to the performance in the singleplayer campaign as well. Finally, Geneshift is going on sale for a week on Steam at 20% off. If you haven't bought it yet or have some friends who are keen, now would be a great time to let them know.

308600,3 New Skills in v1.02!,"Version 1.02 is out with 3 brand new skills. The ideas came from the massive reddit thread I made a few weeks ago asking for skill suggestions. There were some amazing ideas there and I've just added my 3 favorites! http://i.imgur.com/UsdjFCP.gif 3 New Skills Physicals get Reverse Fire, allowing you to shoot bullets behind you and cover your rear. Mentals get Mirror Image, which creates a clone of yourself to deceive enemies; and Cybernetic players get Vapor Slide, which makes the floor slippery and lets you move extra fast. They're probably super unbalanced, so please help me test them out and give feedback! 3 New Cash System This version also includes a big change to the cash system in the campaign, placing a lot more focus on earning kill combos. Underneath the minimap is a miniature leaderboard that shows the highest kill combo earned on a given stage, and gives credit to the player who got it. http://i.imgur.com/9Lsr8Bk.gif New Vehicle Section From reading reviews the vehicles are everyone's favourite part of the campaign, so I wanted to give more of that. I've added a second car sequence to Laboratory where you fly through a road-block and drive a bunch of dudes over. Bug & Balance Fixes As always there are bug and balance fixes. The most notable ones are a rework to Blade Fury's busting mechanic, and Firestorm's explosions are now spread out in a line. Venom has been nerfed along with shotguns. For more details check the changelog in-game or on the forums. Have fun!",1498551582,"['auto_migrated', 'hide_library_overview', 'hide_library_detail']"

308600,Version 1.01 is coming!,"Ooo baby, back to coding after a great launch. We've reached the ""Very Positive"" rating on Steam; the Discord community has hundreds of new members; and we've played some really fun games together. Thanks a million guys! https://i.imgur.com/JPmTXCC.gif I also recently got some love on reddit. I asked for skill ideas and received over 4000 responses! This blew my mind and some of the ideas are really awesome. So... lets add them! 3 New Skills I want to add 3 new skills for next version. The best 3 from the reddit thread. One for each skill tree. If you want to, please browse through the ideas and reply here with links to your favourites. New Vehicle Section I want to add a sweet vehicle section to the start of Subway in the campaign as well. From reading reviews the vehicles are everyone's favourite part, so I want to give more of that. The Hornet is a very fun vehicle and I'm going to create a sequence where you're driving along the train tracks firing missiles at Rebels hiding in the vents. Bug & Balance Fixes Venom is OP, I know I know! I will be fixing a few of the bugs and balance issues that have been raised in the week since launch. I also want to give a few quality of life improvements such as making the smoke on the Capturer chemical red. Lots of tweaks to look forward to. Anyway, that's it for now. I don't know how long this will take but I am pumped to do it, because for the past 2 months I have done nothing but send emails and do marketing. Now I get to geek out and add fun stuff again!
