1599340,Kazeros The First After Race Update,"Heroes of Arkesia,There have been exciting moments on the battlefield in the race against Kazeros, along with dramatic moments off of the battlefield, but the time to open The First Mode to a wider group of players has arrived. We previously announced that after the top 10 teams in each region have been identified, the next weekly maintenance will unlock the First After Race, an ongoing mode where players can compete for class-based leaderboards based around clear time. Unfortunately, due to our version of Lost Ark having multiple regions, we cannot open the after race separately in the regions, it needs to be done at the same time.We’ve seen many requests from players who want to experience The First Mode, but want the damage increase that Ark Grid provides to help ease the difficulty slightly. While North America has the Top 10 locked in, there are still a few slots open in Europe. We will be giving the European region until the next maintenance to vie for the remaining leaderboard spots. The race will officially end, regardless of the number of eligible teams who have cleared, when weekly maintenance begins on December 24.During that maintenance, we will enable the First After Race, along with the ability for the Ark Grid system to be used in Kazeros The First. This will allow a wider range of players to attempt this special difficulty, and we’re also excited to see the beginning of the in-game leaderboards. Heroes at the top of leaderboard each week will earn temporary cosmetics, and those at the top when The First Mode ends (date to be determined) will earn the cosmetics (such as an insignia and class symbol) in perpetuity. The Ark Grid will become enabled for this mode.As a reminder, disqualifications are based solely on violations of the five conditions we set forth for the race as well as our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service, not player reports or leaderboard positioning. Our review process involves multiple independent team members examining account behavior, transaction patterns, and gameplay data. We do not discuss specific cases publicly, but all disqualifications are supported by clear evidence of policy violations.Congratulations to those who have participated in an eligible clear, and good luck players in the European Region this week! We have the cosmetic items ready for 1st - 6th place winners in North America, along with 1st - 5th place winners in Europe, and we will be distributing them this week. The rest of the custom rewards will be prepared in the coming weeks as we await the final week of clears in Europe, and will be distributed in early to mid January.Thanks for your support, and we’ll see you in Arkesia.",1765996251,

1599340,Eye on Arkesia: November 2025,"This month introduces one of our most anticipated releases yet — the climactic battle against Kazeros himself. November’s Day of Prophecy brings not just one, but two major raids that will test the limits of even our most seasoned raiders. Let's jump right in, starting with Paradise before going into the raids, new endgame activities, the Ark Grid System, and The First Race.Looking ahead, we'll reveal our plans for 2026 and beyond in December, and can't wait to share what's coming next. Until then, we hope you're preparing for Kazeros. Once these raids release, don't forget to share your victories with us on social media. We love seeing our heroes succeed.Thanks for your support and we’ll see you in Arkesia!",1762967211,
1599340,Team Update - Progression Events,"Heroes of Arkesia,We’re making a few updates and changes to the plan surrounding progression events that were previously discussed in our last roadmap. Key, upcoming changes to improve player progression were recently shared through a Director Livestream in Korea, and we view these changes as extremely important to the player experience in the West. Some examples include improving the experience for Advanced Honing stages 1-2, removing Elixirs/Transcendence (and moving the effects elsewhere). These are changes that our team and community have been championing for, as they are important to the overall player experience in Lost Ark. We’re excited to collaborate with Smilegate RPG on bringing these changes to the West as soon as possible, and are delaying our planned progression events from November to December to accompany the release of as many of the changes as we’re able to.November will be about celebrating the endgame and the hardcore players eagerly awaiting their chance to challenge The Lord of the Abyss, and December will be focused on helping provide a better new and returning player experience. We have worked to extend the current Event Powerpass that was going to end in November for one month (until the December Update), as we didn’t want a month long gap while we wait for the changes. This should help any players who return or are looking to build out their roster in the meantime.November will include the Kazeros Challenge event, built to help players reach the endgame levels required to challenge Act 4 and Denouement: Final Day. This system will release as it did in Korea. Players will be able to complete endgame progression related missions, such as clearing raid gates and reaching item level thresholds, to earn valuable rewards that continue to help progression. It will help with systems such as Karma, Advanced Honing 3-4, and include a variety of honing, progression, and Ark Grid materials. We saw some concerns about needing to progress through both raids and maybe missing out on some Ark Grid materials or Gold week 1, so we’ve also added a little bonus event to give a few extra Ark Grid materials and 70K Gold for every player who completes some missions.However, we saw feedback that players wanted additional help, so you won’t have to wait long. Another event will release in December built to help increase progression (details are still being developed), alongside a new Powerpass and an Express event. Combined with our push to include progression updates, this should help all adventurers in Arkesia reach endgame, whether that’s a main character for a new or returning player, or existing players wanting to raise an alternate character.Mokoko Bootcamp will still return this month, and run until February with some changes. The Mokoko Bootcamp has been expanded to include players below Item Level 1700, Act 2 HM, Act 3 NM, and include a variety of new rewards. We anticipate Veteran players’ time to be more occupied at the beginning as they learn the two new endgame raids arriving; Act 4 and Denouement: Final Day, and will hopefully have more time to help Mokokos when the fresh wave of progression updates and events arrive in December. While there may not be as many Mokokos in November, players will still be able to help them through raids for event tokens if they have the time.While we know that some players were looking forward to creating a new character, we think that this update will be a large positive overall for players in different stages of their journey through Arkesia, letting Veterans challenge Kazeros before we welcome fresh waves of reinforcements in December. There will be more news of what you can expect in the November update in Eye on Arkesia later this week, and the full release notes next week.In the meantime, we wish you luck in your preparation for the Day of Prophecy, and we’ll see you in Arkesia.",1762884452,

We've been monitoring data, reviewing player feedback, and after many of hours of sleep post-merge, have been hopping in-game to test the new network structure ourselves. We're happy to see that it's been holding up well, and are excited to announce that we will be keeping this structure (so no need for the back-up plan we announced before the merge). The only update we plan to make is regarding Party-Finder and Matchmaking rulesets. In case you missed the first announcement, we have improved logic planned that will arrive in the November Update:Party-Finder: Instance will be created in the world of the lobby leader.Matchmaking:A full group of players from the original NA West worlds will have an instance created in NA West.A full group of players from the original NA East worlds will have an instance created in NA East.A mixed group of players will default to NA East. For players that rely on ping to NA West (such as those connecting from Oceania) we recommend using the party-finder tool to ensure they can find or create a lobby that best meets their needs.Tracking Future ProjectsWith the merge completed and the October Update featuring the Kazeros Prelude finalized, our team is now working to finish some upcoming plans.

1599340,Region Merge Update,"Heroes of Arkesia,The region merge for North America has arrived! The merge will begin tonight during the weekly maintenance at 12AM PT (7AM UTC). We are currently estimating total downtime for the North American regions to be 20hrs. For the European region, we estimate that downtime will last 8hrs.If you’re currently a resident of the North American regions being merged, learn about our plans for structuring servers, along with the planned compensation, gifts, and more!NA Server StructureOur teams at Amazon Games and Smilegate RPG have been collaborating in-person on some region merge magic to create the best possible experience for players post-merge. While the servers of North America West and East will be connected into one in-game region, the game worlds will remain in their original server locations. This will allow players to enjoy the positive aspects of the merge, such as a combined Auction House and Market, and new players to forge relationships within raid/dungeon groups, while mitigating concerns around latency/ping. Players will continue to enjoy the same experience while in their world, and you can learn more about the matchmaking/party-finder experience for instanced content below. For players joining from NA West, please note that the Auction House and Market will be hosted out of NA East, so players with high latency may notice slight lag in extreme circumstances.Dungeon/Raid ExperienceImmediately following the merge, we will be implementing a temporary ruleset for all instanced content (raids, dungeons, etc.). This temporary ruleset will be replaced with an improved version during the November Update, which will stay in-game as the planned final ruleset featuring different rules for matchmaking and party-finder.Temporary Ruleset (October - November) for matchmaking and party-finderInstances will default to NA East for lobbies with players from different worlds.If the lobby has 8 players from Brelshaza, the lobby will be created in Brelshaza.If the lobby has 8 players from Thaemine, the lobby will be created in Thaemine.However, if players from both Brelshaza and Thaemine are in a mixed lobby, they could still enter an instance hosted in NA East.Final Ruleset (Planned for the November Update)Party-Finder: Instance will be created in the world of the lobby leader.Matchmaking:A full group of players from the original NA West worlds will have an instance created in NA West.A full group of players from the original NA East worlds will have an instance created in NA East.A mixed group of players will default to NA East. For players that rely on ping to NA West (such as those connecting from Oceania) we recommend using the party-finder tool to ensure they can find or create a lobby that best meets their needs.We’re excited for the opportunities this will create for players to be able to play together while still having control and agency over their raid and dungeon experience, and will be on the lookout for feedback to ensure it is best meeting the needs of our community.Back-up PlanWhile testing has looked extremely promising for this custom solution leading up to the merge, we are preparing a back-up plan of hosting the Brelshaza and Thaemine Servers in NA East to avoid ongoing extensions of the region merge maintenance. If we need to proceed with the back-up plan, it could result in an additional maintenance. Afterward, we will continue to investigate the solution with NA West and NA East hosted servers that are connected, and identify a future window to make the change. We will provide updates and ensure the community is made aware of the status and result as we proceed through the merge.General Merge NotesWhile based in NA West, Brelshaza and Thaemine will need to share the same server time as the other worlds in the region, so they will be updated to NA East timing.It may take up to one hour for the NA West Crucible Leaderboard information to display after servers are up from the merge, due to the server refreshing rankings hourly.We’ll be on the lookout for feedback regarding the post-merge experience. If you encounter issues or have feedback, please let us know!After the MergeMerge CompensationThe following compensation gift will be available in the in-game shop \ for players in the merged region at no cost:Rest Bonus Recovery Brew x3Aura of Resonance Recovery Elixir (14 days) x3(NEW) Ebony Cube Entrance Ticket Selection Chest x3Regulus's Light Currency Chest x5Crystalline Aura (3 days) x1Collective Battle Item Chest x3There will also be a 1-day Azena’s Blessing compensation sent to each character in the merged region with Azena’s Blessing active during the merge.

1599340,Team Update - Kazeros Release Plans,"Heroes of Arkesia,In our previous team update, we discussed that we’d been reviewing lots of feedback around the Kazeros The First clear race along with the raid release plans. Today, we’re sharing an updated plan based around player feedback to ensure the release of the climactic battle against Kazeros is the best experience possible for the Lost Ark community.Updated Release PlanWe’ve been reviewing player feedback and collaborating heavily with Smilegate RPG to customize the release plan and find the solution that best meets the needs of the Western Playerbase. We investigated several release plans but ultimately decided on the raid rollout listed below. You can dive into the final version of the plan, including dates and commentary on our reasoning for selecting this release plan.Major November Update - November 19Kazeros Raid: Act 4 and Kazeros Raid Denouement: Final Day will be released together as part of the major November Update on November 19. We were initially hesitant to release both raids on the same day as it could be overwhelming for players, but when looking through various scenarios, we think this will best meet the needs of our diverse playerbase for the following reasons:For the top raiders, this will grant a practice window to level the playing field against players who have been practicing in other regions.For hardcore players, this will be a lot of content, especially when talking about multiple characters, but should prove to be an exciting update as players progress through one battle after another. If Hard or Normal mode for Denouement proves to be too much for the first week, there will be second week to clear before the first round of Frontier nerfs.For less hardcore players, where clearing as fast as possible is not a top priority and who enjoy the assistance of the Frontier System, this will allow a natural progression into the Frontier System in Denouement if the first few weeks after the update are spent learning Act 4. While normally we’d want to ensure that everyone is able to experience the original form of the fight before the Frontier system, Kazeros Raid Denouement will have a difficult version preserved for the foreseeable future with The First Mode allowing players to have a challenging experience on demand, even if they miss it in the first few weeks.Kazeros the First Race - December 3The First Mode (along with first clear race) will unlock two weeks later, on December 3, along with the first wave of Frontier Adjustments for both Kazeros Raid: Act 4 and Kazeros Raid Denouement: Final Day. We chose this date for 3 reasons:This will help level the playing field against players who have been practicing in other regions, by giving players two weeks to experience Hard Mode. While The First Mode will still present a greater challenge, this preparation time should help address a top concern amongst the broader community.We also saw concerns that the race would be taking place during North American holidays, which would prevent players from participating. This date will ensure players in North America are home and ready to play.The first wave of the Frontier Nerfs will allow players to reclear homework content faster than normal, for players who want to try their hand at The First Mode, without sacrificing the rewards from reclearing Act 4 and Denouement.In Game After Race Leaderboards – After Top 10The in-game After Race leaderboards will unlock during the weekly update after the leaderboard is full. This event will live in-game for the duration of the First Mode (until it ends at a future date, which is to be determined) allowing players to score their fastest clear time on character-based leaderboards and be rewarded with exclusive cosmetics and prizes!We hope this mode will prove fun for players who want to improve and prove they are skillful enough to master the battle against the Lord of the Abyss. While all players can participate in this secondary leaderboard event, our primary enforcement focus and restrictions remain centered around the First Clear Race for Kazeros, as the rewards for the After Race are on a rolling weekly grant. Seasonal Rewards are subject to additional reviews when the event ends at a date to be determined. Should an account on the After Race Leaderboard be found in new violation of our ToS, Code of Conduct, or event conditions, there may be action taken against the offending player, depending on the violation. This includes account-wide disadvantages, such as invalidating the clear’s eligibility, removing achieved ranking records and event rewards or an account ban.Looking AheadWe have seen a lot of player questions about the race and policies and will share the full policy document in the near future as we head toward the race. In the meantime, we hope the dates are helpful as you begin to determine your plans to meet the Lord of the Abyss in battle next month. We appreciate the passion and feedback we’ve seen from players on this topic and wil...",1760717253,

1599340,October Team Update,"Heroes of Arkesia,As we head toward the North American Region Merge and the climactic battle against Kazeros arriving in November, we had a few quick topics we wanted to discuss. We’re going to dive right into a team update, and will also be following up with some more thorough updates and policies in the coming weeks.Region MergeNA West will be merged into NA East on October 22. The full policy will be released on October 15, but will be straightforward as no servers (and therefore rosters) are being merged. Because of the region merge, the October content update will be at the end of the month, arriving on October 29. We also wanted to give an early warning that after the October update, the time between the October and November updates will be shorter to adjust the update timing for November and December to the middle of the month.As previously shared, we’ve worked to create fairer naming policies for characters and guilds, and have been working to reduce the downtime by deleting permanently banned accounts to optimize our systems and improve the overall experience for legitimate players. While the downtime will still be extensive for NA West and NA East, we are working to ensure it is as short as possible.We are planning to release additional names from inactive accounts later this year or early next year, after the merge. We are conducting this after the merge to prevent players from potentially making multiple name changes only to lose their desired name alongside their original.RoadmapLucky BoxWe have seen speculation in the community surrounding the Lucky Box event, as different versions of this event have been released in different regions of Lost Ark around the globe. We wanted to clarify that the version releasing will closely resemble the version originally released in Korea, without the gacha-style systems present in other regions.For players not aware of what the system entails, you can complete daily and special missions to earn Lucky Boxes, which contain various honing materials, trade items, cards and potentially a Surprise Box. The Surprise Box has a chance to drop special items, like a Relic Engraving Selection Chest, Chaos Stones with a 100% success rate, Legendary Card Selection Pack, along with honing materials.Thaemine ExtremeAdditionally, we saw some questions asking if Thaemine Extreme would still be launching in the West. With the Assault Raid running until the first ever double raid release with Act 4 and Kazeros in November, the timing didn’t feel quite right. Along with the Ark Grid System we didn’t want to overwhelm players with too many raids and systems to learn, so we’re waiting to release it until the timing makes sense given other events and content releases. We’ll share more updates in the future, likely in a future roadmap.Kazeros The FirstOur team has been reviewing lots of feedback around the Kazeros The First clear race, raid release plans, and are doing our best to factor this into our plans and policies as we head toward the climactic battle in November. While these plans are still being developed, we wanted to share an early look at a few policies/plans.A player that has been penalized for RMT or other forms of cheating in Lost Ark will be ineligible to compete in the first clear race, no matter when they received it (from launch until the race). We will also be conducting extensive account reviews (similar to the Thaemine The First Race) to ensure there is no disqualifying behavior hidden in the past.While speed-hacking has not been a widespread issue in Lost Ark (in terms of volume), we understand the negative impact and we want to ensure that it won’t be present in the competition. While we generally don't post our ban or cheat detection numbers, we have been continuing to develop new detections methods for speed-hacks. Just in the past few weeks, we've caught and banned over 100 accounts using speed-hacks. This work will continue, and ramp up, as we head toward the race.We are continuing to investigate other plans for the release of Kazeros to ensure that it best fits our community, and will share any updates we have as soon as we’re able. We know that players who intend to race are curious about the date, and we’ll share that once the plan has been fully locked in.We appreciate the passion from the community along with the ongoing feedback and questions, and will be working to provide updates throughout the merge process and as we head toward the battle against Kazeros in November. In the meantime, we’ll see you in Arkesia.",1759943606,

Players increasingly feel like keeping up is like having a second job if you're not willing to get your credit card out, but time-limited content, RNG-based gear upgrades, and separate accounts for each server all contribute to an aura of malcontent around the game. It currently sits at a 'mixed' rating on Steam, with just 67% of English-language reviews rating it positively.

1599340,Lost Ark 2025 Roadmap – Part 4,"Heroes of Arkesia,Welcome back to our final roadmap for 2025. We can’t wait for players to finally experience the epic conclusion to the Kazeros storyline, but there are even more major updates to look forward to between now and December, including the Ark Grid endgame progression system. Team members Roxx, Matt, and Henry also return for a glimpse into the next few months of Lost Ark in part 4 of our 2025 roadmap videos.Read on for a month by month summary featuring the highlights.OctoberRegion MergeThere will be a merge of the NA West and NA East regions one week before the major October Update. Stay tuned for announcements covering everything you need to know in the near future. We’ve factored in player feedback to ensure a more fair naming policy due to the large volume of idle names across each region. Our goal is to reward active players who created their name first based on the following policy:The name is granted to the player with highest combat level on their roster. For example, someone that has played since the launch of Tier 4 with a lvl. 70 character will receive the name over another player with roster with a lvl. 60 character from launch.If both names have the same highest level character on the roster (ie. both lvl. 70), the name will be granted to the player who first created the name. Guild names will be granted to whichever guild was created first.No servers or rosters will be merged. However, the downtime for the merged regions will be extensive. To help mitigate downtime, we are also working to remove the data of perma-banned bot accounts that have been banned for over a year. This will not impact players in good standing or with temporary bans.We have also been planning to release additional names from inactive accounts later this year or early next year, although it didn’t make sense to do so before this merge. We want to prevent players from potentially making multiple name changes only to lose their desired name alongside their original.Kazeros Raid Prelude: Destined TrajectoryThe corruption that began in the depths has crossed over the Kurzan Abyss, tainting the seas. The long-lost body of Kazeros has begun to take form within the fog. What will befall Arkesia in the future?Embark on a prologue questline that leads to truth as the long-prophesied war nears its end. A new NPC will be added to Elnead where you can start this quest. It can be completed once per roster, but only after finishing the Act 1 through 3 prologue quests as well as the Rimeria World Quest and Hyper Awakening Quests. The Kazeros Raid Prelude: Destined Trajectory will prepare you for the narrative climax against the Lord of the Abyss and is a requirement to enter the Act 4 Kazeros Raid.Additional UpdatesArk PassThe October Ark Pass will include the Mist Knight skins, cat mounts, and cat pets.Lucky Box eventComplete daily and special missions to earn Lucky Boxes and prepare for endgame challenges coming later this year. Lucky Boxes contain various honing materials, trade items, cards and potentially a Surprise Box. The Surprise Box has a chance to drop special items, like a Relic Engraving Selection Chest, Chaos Stones with a 100% success rate, Legendary Card Selection Pack, along with honing materials.Balance PatchThe Korean Balance patch that arrived alongside Kazeros will release in October!Proving Grounds Season 7This is the first Competitive Match season to feature the Three Champions Game Mode. Expect the standard competitive ratings adjustments based on performances in the last season, plus seasonal rewards when Season 7 wraps up next year. There will also be QoL adjustments, such as top ranked builds appearing in the Book of Coordination.NovemberKazeros Raid: Act 4Say hello to our first-ever double raid release, starting with Kazeros Raid: Act 4, the Fortress of Destruction. Act 4 is an 8-player, 2-gate, endgame raid starting with a memorable face-off against Covetous Master Echidna. As the battle goes on, her attacks grow increasingly varied. Higher up in the towering passages of Diaspero lurks the Abyss-infused statue sentinel, Armoche. Armoche dominates the battlefield with sweeping strikes from his halberd and shield.Normal Difficulty will require Item Level 1700 or above, and Hard Mode will require Item Level 1720 or above.Kazeros Raid Denouement - The Last DayVanquish the powerful enemies guarding the fortress to reach the battle that will determine the fate of Arkesia, an endgame 8-player, 2-gate raid. Even a brief misstep can result in instant death from Kazeros’ overwhelming attacks. He strikes across wide areas while simultaneously restricting movement, leaving little room to escape. Kazeros in Gate 1 is but a faint shadow compared to the despair that awaits. His true form will be revealed in Gate 2. Good luck! We’re excited for players to experience the events that will unfold firsthand.To challenge Kazeros Raid: Denouement – The Last Day, you must Clear the Gate 2 of Act 4: Fortress of Destru...",1759248350,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_487176015_1759250199_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

1599340,Team Update - Account Related Adjustments,"We’ve been working hard to prepare for the upcoming region merge and want to share an important policy update that will help ensure the smoothest possible experience for our active community members.Account Cleanup Policy - Banned Account RemovalAs we approach the NA West and NA East merge this October, we’re implementing a comprehensive cleanup of permanently banned accounts to optimize our systems and improve the overall experience for legitimate players. Starting this week, we will begin removing accounts that meet specific criteria related to violations and ban duration.Which Accounts Are Being Affected:Accounts with bot-related permanent EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) bans that have been in place for over 365 daysAccounts with permanent bot-related penalties that have been in place for over 365 daysOnly accounts with permanent bot related violations - temporary bans and active accounts are not affectedTimeline and Maintenance ImpactThis account removal process will begin this week and continue leading up to the region merge. Players should be aware that some of our scheduled maintenances may run longer than usual as we work through this cleanup process. We’re breaking it up to avoid one extremely long downtime, especially as we keep the downtime for Region Merge in mind. We will provide updates on extended maintenance windows as they occur.Why We’re Making This ChangeWe’re implementing this policy for several key reasons that will benefit our active community:Database Optimization: By reducing the volume of permanently banned account data, we’re streamlining what needs to be migrated during the region merge, which will help ensure a smoother transition process.Performance: We want to maintain highest standards for account security and system performance.Transparency and Moving ForwardWe remain committed being as transparent with our player base as possible and felt this behind the scenes change warranted a Team Update so that players know what our team is working on and what to expect with the varied downtimes leading up to the merge. And remember, this this cleanup exclusively targets accounts that have been permanently banned for serious violations, and have been in a banned state for an extended period of time. Active players and those with temporary penalties will see no impact from this process.As we continue preparing for the region merge and other exciting updates coming through the end of the year, we're committed to ensuring that Arkesia remains the best possible experience for our dedicated community. We appreciate your understanding as we work to optimize our systems, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. We will also continue to share key information for players the North American regions as we head toward the merge.We'll see you in Arkesia!",1758663548,

1599340,Team Update - September 2025,"Heroes of Arkesia, There’s a lot on the horizon for Lost Ark in the coming months, so we wanted to do a round-up and talk through a bunch of key initiatives along with some topics we know the community is curious about. Below a recap of the upcoming September Update, you’ll find a section that covers many upcoming projects with some updates and information. This summer has been a wonderful time in Arkesia, and we plan to keep that up with some major projects, big events, and exciting moments throughout the rest of the year.Rimeria BesiegedFor those who missed Eye On Arkesia or some of our other announcements on social media, here’s a quick recap of how the September “Rimeria Besieged” update is shaping up.Update SummaryThe September 17 update will include Assault: Rimeria, which includes an event dungeon and end-game raid, the Combat Analyzer feature, the Honor System, multiple events, and an additional batch of QoL (Quality of Life) changes. The full release notes will be available on Tuesday, September 16.Golden Frog ExtensionWe’ve seen (most) Relic Engraving prices fall despite higher volumes of sales with the Golden Frog. To help increase the supply of Relic Engravings as we head toward the release of Act 4 and Kazeros, the Golden Frog has been extended through October 15th. We also hope that this will allow time for the new and returning players who have started to finish other progression systems to have a head-start on gathering some Relic Engravings.Prestige Shop AdjustmentsWe’re planning some ongoing adjustments to the Prestige Shop, where items will rotate in and out. At the end of September, the bound gold offering will be rotated out, and new offerings (such as Pheons and Life Energy/Leap’s Essence) will be rotated in. We will also work to bring over new cosmetic offerings from Korea when available!Upcoming ProjectsFinal 2025 RoadmapThe final roadmap for 2025 will release at the end of September, and will include the content plans for the rest of the year. We’ll give one spoiler since we’ve seen a lot of players asking about it— the balance patch that released alongside Kazeros in Korea will be arriving in October.Region Merge PolicyWe’ve nearly locked-in the full Region Merge policy for NA West and East, and will be sharing in the weeks leading up to the merge in October. While you’ll need to wait for that policy for all the specifics, we are excited to share that we’ve factored in player feedback to the naming policy that we saw coming out of previous region merges— as this was a hot topic and something we’ve seen a lot of questions in the community about. Instead of giving either region priority for names, we created a policy that will reward active players. With the enormous amount of players at launch, there are names sitting idle in each region that would mean active players wouldn’t receive their name after the merge, which didn’t seem fair. Our way of rewarding players who 1) are active, and 2) got the name first, will be the following policy:The name is granted to the player with highest combat level on their roster (ie. a player who has played since the launch of Tier 4 with a lvl. 70 character will receive the name over a roster with a lvl. 60 character from launch).If both names have the same highest level character on the roster (ie. both lvl. 70), the name will be granted to the player who first created the name.Guild names will be granted to whichever guild was created first.We know that there are many more questions, but wanted to give a little spoiler as we’ve seen many players asking about the naming policy. Once again, we will share all the policy specifics and information on the technical side of the merge as soon as possible as we continue planning and preparing for the merge in October.Kazeros The First PlansWe’ve seen some requests for information on the plans and policies for Kazeros’ release in the West, and wanted to acknowledge. We’ve begun work on the plans and for releasing Kazeros, and the policies for the first clear race in the Western version of Lost Ark. We’ll share some specifics in the upcoming roadmap, and others will be shared closer to the release of the raid once they’re locked in. We understand the importance of this to the hardcore raiding community however, and will work to share information as soon as we’re able to.Paradise / Azena’s BlessingWe wanted to provide a quick note that in the downtime between Paradise seasons that Azena’s Blessing will not provide +1 Elysian Entry Tickets (as the content will not be accessible). It has been fun witnessing the journey through the various stages of Paradise, and seeing players encounter new challenges now that all 10 stages are unlocked. We wish you luck in the rest of the season!

What makes Valkyrie stand out from other classes as well as her male Paladin counterpart?A: Like the Paladin, Valkyrie uses a one-handed sword and channels her Faith Gauge as a resource. However, her combat design and playstyle introduce distinct differences. The most notable difference lies in her identity system. While the Paladin sustains allies through continuous healing and damage reduction via divine aura, Valkyrie utilizes two identity skills—Release Light (Z) and Light of the Faithful (X)—to offer situational support like offensive buffs or instant recovery.Another key distinction is her damage-dealing role through the Ark Passive. The Paladin focuses on steady back-attack-based damage, whereas Valkyrie delivers explosive bursts centered around the skill Final Splendor (X). Even though they share the same resource, the flow and feel of battle differ dramatically.In terms of combat tempo and feel, Valkyrie offers a faster, flashier, and more agile experience than the heavier, grounded playstyle of the Paladin.Q: Her armor and weapon designs are very distinct. What were the inspirations behind her launch skin visual design?A: We began the costume design with a focus on conveying the “sanctity” shared by the Paladin and their gender-locked counterpart, the Valkyrie. To express the clean and pure image that sanctity evokes, we drew inspiration from a bride in a white dress walking down the aisle. The off-shoulder design was also influenced by this concept. We chose white and gold, colors commonly used in bridal rings, as the main palette.The halo, which shines like the glow of the head avatar, further enhances the sense of sacredness. Additionally, to emphasize the keyword “Holy Warrior,” we incorporated armor elements into the costume. However, we avoided overly flashy or extravagant designs that wouldn’t suit a holy warrior, and instead based the design on traditional medieval armor.Q: The Valkyrie's weapon design, alongside her ability to wield two swords, is quite striking. Can you share why the team opted for two swords instead of a sword and shield?A: From early development, a key goal was to differentiate Valkyrie's combat actions from those of the Paladin. While the Paladin projects a calm, defensive presence through his use of a one-handed sword and holy book, Valkyrie was designed to deliver a more aggressive and dynamic feel.To achieve this, Valkyrie was conceptualized to wield multiple sacred relic weapons, depending on the situation. One example is her skill that has her summon and wield a sacred sword alongside her normal sword and briefly engage in dual-blade combat. This symbolizes both her divine power and offensive potential.Weapons like the sacred shield, spear (used in Hyper Awakening), and sacred banner (used in Hyper Awakening) are featured throughout her skill set. These diverse weapon types create a more immersive and cinematic experience, breaking away from the monotony of single-weapon classes. The visual design of divine energy channeling through her sword also reinforces her core concept.Q: What makes Valkyrie visually and functionally different in battle, especially as a support?A: Valkyrie's skills are divided into three categories: Justice, Starlight, and Protection. Each has a distinct theme and purpose.Justice Skills focus on minimal use of divine power, instead relying on refined swordsmanship to present a disciplined and knightly image. Motions like striking and holding posture emphasize composure and control.Starlight Skills allow Valkyrie to summon a sacred sword in her left hand, wielding it like a dual blade, or infusing her one-handed sword with divine energy for powerful strikes. This category enhances her identity as a valiant and symbolic holy warrior.Protection Skills use sacred shields to protect allies or weaken enemies. Some skills include impact animations to strengthen her presence as a defensive class.Unlike traditional ranged supports that provide stable backing from a distance, Valkyrie is designed to engage more actively in battle. Her hybrid structure shares some skills with the DPS Ark Passive, featuring many aggressive visuals. She dashes toward allies and supports them from close range, offering a more hands-on, proactive support experience compared to other support classes.Q: Let's talk about sound. What went into designing the Valkyrie's divine audio?A: To fully capture Valkyrie’s i...",1755187718,

1599340,Team Update - August 2025,"We wanted to share some key information leading up to the August “Rise of the Valkyrie” Update, as we’ve locked in some policies and key changes we know you’ve been looking forward to! It’s been a fun few weeks watching players learn the new Paradise system, progress through the Mokoko Challenge Express, and help new and returning players learn the ropes. The August Update, featuring the Valkyrie Class, will also include a ton of other impactful updates. As always, some things may shift during ongoing development— make sure to checkout next week’s release notes for the final August details.Major August Update - Rise of the ValkyrieBonus PowerpassIn the August Update, we will also be granting all players an additional South Kurzan Powerpass! We saw an enormous amount of new and returning players begin or resume their adventures in Arkesia with the July Update, and want to provide a little boost to help them build out their roster or try out new classes/playstyles. No worries if you haven’t used the first one yet, they will stack.Rise of the Valkyrie EventHeading toward the update, we wanted to share some topline information to help players best plan out how they plan to use the latest “road/path” style event. It can be paired with the Mokoko Challenge Express, or activated on another character. Key details:Event Target Item Level: 1640 – below 1681 can start the event.Honing Support Effects will be provided from Item Level 1660 to 1680.Item Level Rewards will be provided for 1640, 1650, 1660, 1670 and 1680.Players can earn the Item Level 1680 complete rewards and the chest will contain the 1690 and 1700 Rewards chests.Challenge missions will include clearing Aegir and Brelshaza.Rewards will include an assortment of Honing Materials and other Progression Materials. One notable reward will be four bound Tier 4 Lv. 7 Gems!Ebony Cube Update PolicyAs previously shared, In the August Update, we’re going to make a change to Ebony cube and how it interacts with Paradise. This change will double the rewards provided by Ebony Cube, but reduce the Cube Ticket drop rate by 50% (in all places, including the guild shop and dispatches). We think this change will make Ebony Cube more exciting to play, and will also help decrease the amount of homework content with the addition of Paradise. As some players have massive stockpiles of tickets, and others have been dutifully running cubes whenever they get a ticket, 2 tickets will combine into one ticket (with the new doubled rewards) when the update takes place to maintain a fair balance for all players. This will work in the following ways:Players with Cube tickets in their inventories will have the tickets automatically converted.Cube Selection Chests (across the roster in various storages) will be converted as well.The full policy will be shared in the release notes. Please note that the cube changes only apply to Tier 4.Additionally, we will also be adding the ability to convert Ebony Cube Tickets into Hell Keys through the Paradise Exchange Vendor. Each exchange can be done on each character once a week, due to large stacks of cube tickets that currently exist in the wild that would disproportionally favor some players.T4 (1640) Rare Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 1st Unlock x2T4 (1640) Epic Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 1st Unlock x3T4 (1640) Legendary Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 1st Unlock x5T4 (1680) Rare Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 2nd Unlock x2T4 (1680) Epic Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 2nd Unlock x3T4 (1680) Legendary Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 2nd Unlock x5T4 (1680) Epic Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 3rd Unlock x2T4 (1680) Legendary Hell Key x1Cost - Ebony Cube 3rd Unlock x4Tier 3 UpdateTo ensure that players in Tier 3 can be competitive in the weekly Crucible rankings, and for new players/returning players building characters and learning new playstyles, we’re going to move the Hyper Awakening and Hyper Awakening Skills (T-Skills) to unlock in Tier 3.

1599340,Free-to-play MMO Lost Ark totally reworks the grind with bold new Paradise mode,"The <strong>Lost Ark</strong> Paradise update is here, and it's changing the free-to-play MMORPG forever. The biggest game on Steam back at its global launch in February 2022, Lost Ark has dropped down the Valve charts since. In an attempt to win back some of that audience, Amazon Games has been working with Smilegate to build a new mode specifically designed for the game's worldwide audience. It's an experimental, solo-focused way to play that totally overhauls progression, offering a fresh spin on the mechanics of Lost Ark that's accessible to all players, circumnavigating its notorious catch-up process and endgame grind. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark/july-update-paradise-mode"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark/paradise-mode-roadmap"">Lost Ark's revolutionary Paradise mode headlines the free MMO's new roadmap</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark/june-update-2025"">The Lost Ark June update opens up a new island and makes two raids easier</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/10-best-pc-mmos"">The best MMO and MMORPGs to play in 2025</a> ",1753297520,
1599340,Team Update - July Update Commentary,"Heroes of Arkesia,With the “Welcome to Paradise” Release Notes now live, there were a few additional topics we wanted to discuss and provide a short update on! Future of Ebony CubeIn the August Update, we’re going to make a change to Ebony cube and how it interacts with Paradise. This change will double the rewards provided by Ebony Cube, but reduce the Cube Ticket drop rate by 50% (in all places, including the guild shop and dispatches). We think this change will make Ebony Cube more exciting to play, and will also help decrease the amount of homework content with the addition of Paradise. Please note; as some players have massive stockpiles of tickets, and others have been dutifully running cubes whenever they get a ticket, 2 tickets will combine into one ticket (with the new doubled rewards) when the update takes place to maintain a fair balance for all players. Additionally, when this update takes place, we will also be adding the ability to convert Ebony Cube Tickets into Hell Keys through the Paradise Exchange Vendor. There are still some things up in the air that we’re considering, how it will work with different level cube tickets, whether or not there will be weekly exchange limits and other details— but we wanted to provide as early of a notice as possible to maintain transparency, in case players who normally run all their cubes want to save up a few. We’ll be doing a follow-up team update when once we get some of those of details fully locked in! August Road/Path EventSimilarly, we’re still working to tune the details of the upcoming road/path style progression event arriving alongside the Valkyrie, but will provide an update as soon as we finalize the details on the types of rewards, along with the Item Level requirements. 2025 Swimsuit SkinsSummer is definitely heating up in Arkesia. Showing off the full line of swimsuit skins would’ve required us to add an age-gate to the website— but don’t worry, they’ll all be in-game tomorrow!

1599340,Team Update - Awaiting Paradise,"Heroes of Arkesia,Next week’s release notes are shaping up to be the longest set of notes on record. Before those drop, we had a few topics we wanted to discuss in a setting outside of the release notes.Event ReminderBefore we dive in, here’s a quick reminder from our previous Team Update. With the player-requested change to have the progression events release in July alongside the Paradise Update, players interested in making the Valkyrie Advanced Class will need to wait to activate the progression events. The events will still be live for several months after the release of the class— plenty of time to progress and unlock all the benefits offered by the Mokoko Challenge Express.To coincide with the Summer Player Gift, we will also be sending the Legendary Skin gift to all players with the July update! Players who want to use the Legendary Skin on the Valkyrie Advanced Class will be able to hold it until the class releases. Once again, we think this will be a net benefit for all players. The timing won’t change for Valkyrie enthusiasts, but sometimes patience can be more difficult when the shiny skins are sitting in your inventory. We wish you luck!Mokoko BootcampMokoko Bootcamp will be releasing with a variety of changes built to help players organically progress and learn, and will be running until October. We hope to continually improve the system, and will be on the lookout for additional feedback to ensure that this community-centric event is accomplishing the goals of breaking down gate-keeping barriers and making helping others a fun time for all. To fit that theme, the title for this version of the Mokoko Bootcamp will be “Mokoko Gatesmasher”, accompanied with a title icon of a hammer.As these events are built to promote community cohesion, we thought it may be fun to get the community more involved in the title and icon process heading forward. For future Mokoko Bootcamps, we’re going to run a title and icon contest to put the power in the hands of the community to decide what you want. We didn’t want every title to follow the same bootcamp theme and lose their value, so we thought this could be a fun way for veteran players to choose their reward. We’ll follow up with more details (and contest rules) as we head toward the next Bootcamp, but wanted to share our idea so people could begin brainstorming alongside any other feedback they have on the event!Gold AdjustmentsWith Paradise introducing vast new quantities of progression materials (including fusion materials and character bound gold), and the progression event providing everything a new player could need (from max cards to entry level accessories), we are introducing some gold changes for endgame content to better balance rewards.Our goal with the changes was to prevent alternate rosters from farming too much gold that could be moved to other rosters/accounts, while ensuring that players in those levels weren’t impacted heavily. Some solo modes have had their gold increased, some other raids will see decreases, and a few just have changes to the balance of bound gold vs. unbound gold. For example, the highest level raid adjusted was Aegir (Normal), with no changes in total gold, but with a rebalance to move some gold into bound gold. Additionally, the bonus item boxes (view more rewards) that can be purchased after each gate have been decreased in price for many raids (up to Aegir Hard Mode) to reward players who are looking to continue to progress their characters.We wanted to share this update ahead of time, and explain the reasons in a place outside of the release notes— since they’re over 23,000 words total! There’s a lot of other things that will be covered in those notes early next week, including the full number changes for raids with changed reward prices and changed total gold amounts.Bonus note— to help players who want to work on their roster as a whole, we have pivoted the character bound gold in the Mokoko Challenge Express event to be roster bound gold.Market DiscussionsBound GemsAs previously announced, the July update will introduce the Luminous Gem system into the Western version of Lost Ark. Our region’s player to player market was more resilient than other regions, and the price of level 10 damage gems today have barely decreased from their price when the original announcement was shared in Korea. As level 10 damage gems have retained nearly all of their value and they will still be fully usable by their owners, the compensation sent out in some other regions of Lost Ark will not be distributed in the Western version.We’re excited for the new and fun customization opportunities that the Luminous Gem system will provide for all players, with greater freedom to try out new builds, and that the new T4 Luminous Gems in the Solo Shop help new and returning players gear up for the challenges that await them in the war against Kazeros.Sidereal EnergySimilarly, our region didn’t experience major price fluctuations for Sidereal En...",1752854361,

1599340,Lost Ark from Amazon Games appears to have enabled the anti-cheat for Linux / SteamOS,Lost Ark is a free to play MMO from Smilegate RPG and Amazon Games that was previously blocked on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck but now works.

1599340,Team Update - July 2025,"Heroes of Arkesia,We've shared several exciting announcements through LOA ON and our recent Roadmap Part 3 article. While we've worked to provide comprehensive details in our updates, there are additional topics the community has been discussing that we'd like to address and offer more clarity.Style Book and Stronghold Portrait PolicyFirst off, we’ve seen some confusion in the community regarding moderation of style book and portrait uploads. Anything that is merely showing off an in-game character in their skins/cosmetics is allowed (including swimwear and other revealing outfits). However, we will be moderating and applying penalties for uploads that attempt to depict sexual acts, character nudity with skin dyes, and other disruptive or harmful content. You can refer to the Amazon Games Code of Conduct for further information on what type of content is not tolerated.July UpdateAlong with everything we already announced for July (Paradise, May/June Balance, UI improvements, Solo Aegir & Solo Rework, Skin Book, Una Overhaul, Gem Updates, Party Finder Lounge, Tripod Level/Epic Engraving simplification), there is a ton more in the update. When we share some of those specifics early in the roadmap, it’s meant to be an early sneak-peek into what’s coming, but not a comprehensive list of everything. There is a ton more arriving in July, so here’s a few more selected spoilers (which we’ve seen the community asking about) to keep up the excitement before the full release notes with every detail are shared:Maharaka Festival will be returning.You will be able to celebrate in the pools of Maharaka Paradise with the latest swimsuit skins!The Achievement system overhaul is arriving.4 Hairstyles will be added (2 for each base class).Beginner Growth Improvements:Guide mission adjustments.Mokoko Buff Extended to 1660.Procyon's Protection expanded up to Aegir.Gear Crafting requirement reduction.Additional QoL surrounding daily activities, including Kurzan Frontline, Guardians, and Una’s Tasks.Progression Event UpdateWe saw a lot of player requests for our team to attempt to move the Valkyrie Advanced Class from August to July. While the class won’t be ready in time, we also saw a lot of requests bubbling up in the community to have the progression events active for players returning or interested in starting their adventure in Arkesia when the massive amount of improvements arrive— so we made the decision to release the Powerpass and Mokoko Challenge Express Event early, in the July Update.This shift means that players interested in making the Valkyrie Advanced Class will need to wait to activate the events, but we think that giving new or returning players the ability to hop right into the action will be a better experience overall. For those who wanted to create a Valkyrie nothing will change, and the events will still be live for several months after the release of the class— plenty of time to progress and unlock all the benefits offered by the Mokoko Challenge Express. We will provide a few more additional notices reminding players to save the events for Valkyrie if they’re planning to use them when the class releases in August.We are planning to have an additional event that will release in August, similar to past “road/path” events to further help players progress, or allow players planning on making the Valkyrie Advanced Class to quickly progress.Long Term ProjectsWe are currently targeting this fall (around October) to merge NA West & NA East, so we will have one region for North America and one for Europe. We’ve seen a lot of player feedback both requesting this merge along with questions regarding when it may happen, so we wanted to provide an update. There’s a ton of details that we’ll dive into as we head toward the merge in future team updates along with dedicated policies about the merge, but we wanted to be transparent about when we anticipate this arriving.This will be a major project requiring a lot of the team’s attention, so we will need to put some other projects on the backburner, including work on the API. We will provide future updates on the API when we’re able, but need to adjust internal resources in the meantime.Looking AheadWhile we provided some additional spoilers in this team update, there are still many other changes arriving to make your experience in Arkesia even better in the July Update. We’re excited to see players progress faster with Paradise and major QoL adjustments, and will be on the lookout for feedback as we continually strive to make life in Arkesia the best it can be.We appreciate the ongoing support, feedback, and passion from you, the Lost Ark community, and will continue to provide team updates as soon as we’re able.

1599340,Mythic Desert Collection Store Showcase,"Go behind the scenes with Smilegate RPG on the western exclusive Mythic Desert collection. This latest store showcase introduces the Onyx Mythic Desert skins, Quartz Mythic Desert skins, Mystic Chameleon pet, and the Kingstrider mount. How will you stand apart as a sovereign of sand across all of Arkesia?Check out the full selection throughout our interview below, plus the stunning desert temple Chrome Sanctuary wallpaper. From concept to creation, here’s how the Development Team crafted each cosmetic. Q. What inspired the overall theme and aesthetic of this cosmetic set?A: The Mythic Desert cosmetics were inspired by the transcendent and ornate depictions of gods and priests found in ancient desert murals. From there, we explored ways to reinterpret the grandeur and mystique of ancient priesthood within the fantasy world of Lost Ark.The defining features of this skin set are its symbolic patterns and visual effects. For the patterns, we drew from hieroglyphs and motifs seen in ancient desert artifacts, infusing them with our game's unique aesthetic.As for the accessories and effects, we focused on capturing the shimmering golden hues of desert sands under the sun. The silhouettes reminiscent of halos and wings further emphasize the divine nature of the design.Q. Were there any changes made during implementation compared to the original concept art? What challenges did you face in bringing the design in-game?A: One of the main challenges was preserving the unique feel of the emissive patterns and effects portrayed in the concept art. It was crucial for us to bring those visuals to life in-game with minimal loss in quality.This required close and seamless collaboration between the concept, modeling, and effects teams, with constant communication and testing throughout the process.As a result, we were able to not only retain the beauty of the original concept but elevate its presence in-game. We believe the final product turned out to be a truly eye-catching piece.Q. What inspired the designs for the Mystic Chameleon pet and Kingstrider mount?A: The pet was inspired by desert chameleons—creatures that embody resilience in harsh environments. We reinterpreted their adaptability with a playful and whimsical twist.Reflecting the chameleon's ability to change its color depending on the environment, we created a range of diverse and unconventional color variations.For the mount, we took inspiration from the griffin, a mythical creature revered in ancient mythology. Griffins—part lion, part eagle—symbolize both strength and divine authority.To capture the image of a powerful keeper, we designed the mount with sturdy armor, while still aiming for a sleek and agile appearance to suit its flying movement.Q. Since this is global-exclusive content, did you take into account any aesthetic preferences unique to that region?A: Yes, we definitely considered the preferences of global players, especially their appreciation for clear visual direction.We incorporated strong visual contrast, bold effects, and iconic symbols of ancient desert civilizations to align with those tastes.Additionally, we recognized that global users often value cohesive design and narrative depth, so we designed the costume, weapon, pet, and mount to share a unified backstory and symbolism. By doing so, each component contributes to a more immersive and cohesive worldbuilding experience through the cosmetic set.Q. How was designing a wallpaper like Chrome Sanctuary, which diverges from the existing in-game concepts, different from creating standard in-game environments?A: Unlike traditional concept art, which is usually grounded in the main storyline, the wallpaper for the global region allowed for much more creative freedom.From the initial planning phase, the concept was shaped around the tastes of global users, and that direction made the process both refreshing and engaging.In-game environment concepts typically need to align with existing worldbuilding frameworks, which can limit creative flexibility. However, in this case, the ancient desert inspired fantasy theme was entirely new to us—giving us more room to experiment and explore freely.It was a fun and memorable experience, and we’d love to continue working on more content that caters to global tastes in the future.The Mythic Desert collection is available now in-game. Visit the in-game store \ to find your next outfit.Thanks for your support! We’ll see you in Arkesia.",1751472940,
1599340,Lost Ark 2025 Roadmap – Part 3,"Heroes of Arkesia,Lost Ark team members Roxx, Matt, and Henry are back with the next installment of the Lost Ark roadmap, covering what’s in store for July, August, and September, along with a sneak peek at some of the major updates arriving before the end of 2025. As always, since Lost Ark is a live-service game, plans may shift, but we’re excited to reveal what’s ahead—let’s dive into the upcoming content and systems arriving in the second half of the year. Watch the Roadmap video update for the full discussion and deep dive, or find an express summary below the video.JulyNew Progression System: ParadiseLaunching late July, Paradise is a new seasonal system designed specifically for the global version of Lost Ark to help speed up progression and give players new experimental, solo content. Paradise helps players earn valuable rewards through three interconnected activities:ElysianFight waves of monsters to collect Legacy of Paradise gear—a new set of upgradeable equipment (e.g. belt, cloak) that only applies within Paradise. Gear is tiered and can be upgraded through:Restoration – which boosts base statsResonance – adds bonus effects once restoration thresholds are metHigher Paradise levels will unlock throughout the season, and all gear resets between seasons.CrucibleTake on bosses in a 1v1 battle with nearly all power coming from your Legacy of Paradise gear—making this content accessible for all classes, including supports.

Alongside the raid, the Frontier System is offering exclusive first-clear rewards in Hard Mode for those brave enough to take on the raid at full strength. Looking to push your power even further? The Advanced Honing system has been expanded to Level 40, unlocking new stat bonuses, tempering materials, and powerful Ancestor’s Grace effects.

1599340,Team Update - June 2025,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/35SzHNct6fghTK0PS3RvQu/6bb37039954b546deeadea234687d9f2/LA_Blog_SS_09_1920.jpg Heroes of Arkesia, We wanted to provide an update on topics we discussed throughout our recent team video and some found within the latest Korean livestream. We will also be attempting to provide some clarity on other items we haven’t talked about yet. Three quick reminders before we dive in: If you haven’t watched the latest Team Update where Roxx, Matt, and Henry cover some major upcoming changes in the West you can find it here. It has a lot of context you’ll otherwise be missing! As this is a follow-up to that video, we will provide the context necessary for some items, but not at the same depth. We are striving to be as transparent as possible, but don’t want to share dates that could fluctuate this early in the process. To avoid disappointments, we will be sharing general timeframes in this article for the discussed items arriving after the June Update. The next roadmap will be releasing in early July, so if you’re wondering when some of these features will be releasing, make sure to tune in! Similar to the note above, many of these items are in active development, so you may see some changes throughout the process of bringing them to the West. We will share any major updates or changes with you as soon as we can. June Update As June was on the previous roadmap, we wanted to share a few adjustments that will be included soon! Raid Balance & Resurrection System for Kazeros Raids With the June monthly update arriving several weeks after the Act 3 raid, we will be implementing a resurrection system and decreasing the difficulty of several past raids (Behemoth, Echidna, Aegir, and Brelshaza). The June release notes will have full detailed descriptions for both the raid balance adjustments along with the resurrection system, but the quick summary is that each player will receive a single revive (per gate attempt), that can be used after dying to most things (excluding certain patterns or wipe mechanics). This will allow the first few weeks of the Frontier System to remain challenging for Act 3, but will ensure that all raids become more accessible for casual players and alternate characters. Stylebook & Stronghold Portrait Systems We’re excited to announce that the Stylebook feature will be arriving in the main June update at the end of the month. We’ll provide a full overview in the June release notes, but a quick summary of the Stylebook is that it’s a tool that allows players to upload screenshots of their outfits and style for other players to use as inspiration. Players can upvote various looks and favorite them to influence their own styles. We’re very interested to see who will emerge as style icons in the West. Along with the Stylebook feature, new screenshot tools will become available, including a frame feature in the Stronghold where players can display their favorite screenshots. Summer 2025 Mokoko Bootcamp While we saw a lot of positive feedback reinforcing the decision to tie Mokoko status to 10x Raid Clears, we also saw some player concerns about the system still having an Item Level cap after we shared the planned changes, so we wanted to share the planned level. When the Mokoko Bootcamp returns this summer with the adjustments, it will be extended to include Aegir (Act 1) Hardmode and Brelshaza (Act 2) Normal Mode. For these raids, we plan for the Item Level cap to be at 1689, so that players aren’t punished for continuing to progress after reaching the respective Item Levels for those raids at 1680 and 1670. We will continue to lookout for feedback on the system, and appreciate the feedback we’ve received so far! Skin Collection Book Quick context; it’s a feature that allows for a more organized cosmetic collection and expands the number of available slots to stash cosmetics in your inventory. This will release alongside the Paradise system this summer, without the power increase and ranking systems found within other versions of Lost Ark. We hope this is a helpful tool for expanding the closets of Arkesian fashionistas, but don’t want there to be additional pressure to collect every skin. Una’s Task Improvements In the last player survey, we had specific questions about your thoughts on dailies. The feedback provided by you, the Lost Ark Community, helped us during discussions about changes for the Western version of the game. As a direct result, we are very excited to bring the following change to the West. Daily Una’s Tasks will be improved to help balance the amount of daily/weekly ‘homework’ activity when the Paradise system is added into the game. Daily tasks will remain, but once the reputation milestones are reached, the tasks will disappear. Daily Una’s rewards will be moved to weekly quest rewards. General QoL Throughout the summer we plan to implement a variety of upcoming QoL changes; everything from removing Tripod Levels & Epic Engravings to improving the ...",1748888524,

1599340,Free MMORPG Lost Ark is getting a new way to play as Amazon cuts back the grind,"<strong>Lost Ark</strong> is a game I've really enjoyed, fusing the action RPG gameplay and combat of games like Diablo and Path of Exile with the structure, multiplayer focus, and encounter design of MMOs such as FF14 and World of Warcraft. It even won me over with its increasingly weird and wonderful story. Yet its demanding grind and need to log in for regular daily or weekly checklists to keep up meant that as soon as I took a break, it was hard to come back.

1599340,"Lost Ark is finally fixing the game's biggest ""pain point,"" and it's a huge win","Every now and then, I get a weird urge to play <strong>Lost Ark</strong>. One of the first games I ever reviewed, it's one that I look back on with a warm fondness. I loved its dynamic class system, Diablo-style gameplay, and beautiful world, but as of late Arkesia has felt a little bit quiet. I've struggled to clear some of its content due to long queue times resulting from a distinct lack of players. Following a recent broadcast discussing upcoming changes to the Korean version of the game, there's been concerns about gold changes and the infamous 'T3 deadzone,' which has consistently prevented progression. As rumors bubble, Smilegate has addressed all of this and more, and the response has been largely positive. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark/honing-t-3-deadzone-changes"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/10-best-pc-mmos"">The best MMO and MMORPGs to play in 2025</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark-online/ignite-server-chest-exploit"">Game-breaking Lost Ark exploit prompts severe punishments from Amazon</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark-online/endgame-content-solo"">Lost Ark will finally let you solo endgame raids in new update</a> ",1744201079,
1599340,Addressing Community Feedback and Anticipated Changes,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/35SzHNct6fghTK0PS3RvQu/6bb37039954b546deeadea234687d9f2/LA_Blog_SS_09_1920.jpg Heroes of Arkesia, Following the recent Korean Live Stream, we know many of you have questions about how these announcements will impact the Western version of the game. To ensure transparency and avoid speculation, we want to clarify what you can expect based on our internal discussions. Nerfs and Endgame Balance While Smilegate RPG has announced gold adjustments to various raid levels in the Korean version, our region's economy and gold income are not 1:1. We understand concerns about implementing certain nerfs at this stage. Doing so now could negatively impact the experience for both new and returning players, as well as endgame players who are still progressing. Since we are behind the Korean version in terms of how long these raids have been available, we want to carefully consider any gold balance changes to ensure they don’t disrupt progression or overall gameplay experience. We will continue to monitor this closely and provide updates as needed. However, to ease progression costs for new and returning players, we will be implementing the Transcendence and Advanced Honing nerfs. These changes will help make progression more accessible without the negative impact that gold nerfs might have caused. These will be reflected in the April update and are as follows: Advanced Honing Required shards and silver -20% for Tempering stage 1 and 2 Required honing materials -50% to progress Advanced honing level 1 - 20 Required Shards, Silver and Gold -20% for Advanced honing level 1 - 20 Armor Transcendence Restoration 740 Gold > 510 Gold Purification 110 Gold > 75 Gold Weapon Transcendence Restoration 2,200 Gold > 1,460 Gold Purification 190 Gold > 125 Gold Gem System Adjustments We recognize that the current gem system creates barriers to both character progression and playstyle flexibility. Our goal is to create an environment where players can freely enjoy their favorite classes without unnecessary restrictions. While some players choose to play multiple characters of the same class for fun, others choose to optimize gem usage, our focus is on promoting a healthy balance where players feel free to explore classes based on what they find most enjoyable. We will continue to evaluate ways to support greater class diversity and player choice. Smilegate RPG is actively exploring solutions to make the gem system more flexible. We are carefully evaluating multiple options, each with its own pros and cons, to find the best path forward. This process takes time, and we appreciate your patience as we work toward a balanced solution. We’ve said it many times before, but your feedback is invaluable to us. While we may not respond to every social post, we are always listening, actively discussing player concerns, and considering both data and community input in our decisions. Your passion and dedication help shape the game, and we encourage you to continue sharing your thoughts in constructive discussions. Class Balance Patch Class balance is vital to maintaining a fair and engaging gameplay experience, and we take it very seriously. We always strive to bring the latest class balance updates to the Western version as soon as possible. Smilegate RPG’s recent balance patch will be applied in the West’s April update, bringing several important class adjustments. We appreciate your patience as we finalize specifics for the Western version and will continue to share updates as they become available. Content Localization Updates As our game has evolved, we've significantly narrowed the gap with the Korean version. Initially, the well-defined two year roadmap allowed ample time for localizing new continents, raids, in-game guides, and other content across multiple languages. However, as we've got closer to the Korean updates, we've seen increased demand on localization. After careful analysis of player language preferences, we've discovered that German and French localizations are currently being utilized by a much smaller portion of our community than anticipated. Therefore, beginning with the May update, we will cease supporting German and French localizations and reallocate resources to the remaining languages to support the increased localization demand. The game will transition to English voice-over and text for players who previously selected German or French. Moving forward, we will be focusing our localization efforts on English and Spanish support. Our website will also reflect this change for a consistent experience across all platforms, with the in-game translations being supported on the site. You will see these changes take place throughout April. We continue to evaluate our localization strategy and appreciate your understanding as we work to deliver timely content updates.

1599340,Team Update - Recent Ban Waves,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/1lRc0vqyB3SIciI5BmRM8w/4a8d2f148595e609683b54ff1d71b3a7/destroyer_characterart_1920x1080.jpg Heroes of Arkesia, We wanted to take a moment to discuss recent ban waves, publicly share some updated plans related to one of the core tenets of the Amazon Games Code of Conduct— Play Fair. Specifically, we want to discuss the ban waves, and provide a few policy reminders related to RMT and botting behavior. Anti-Cheat and Anti-bot Measures Do not cheat, bot, hack, or use other software or services that give you an unfair advantage through, for example, unattended gameplay or game modifications. Combatting bots has been an ongoing initiative of collaboration between our internal Anti-Cheat teams, Easy Anti-Cheat, and Smilegate RPG. We are constantly evolving detection methods and limiting the impact that bots can have on the economy and general player experience, along with the the use of illicit programs that allow players to automate daily activities and tasks within the game. After reviewing the ban waves, our team found that some accounts, which had no prior violations or bad behavior, used the program to automate daily tasks. While these accounts did not deserve a permanent ban, using the program still violates the Code of Conduct, and it warrants a serious infraction. As a result, these accounts will have their permanent bans reduced to a 30-day suspension. The days already spent banned will count toward this 30-day suspension. We hope that these players will embody the tenet of “Play Fair” heading forward, especially with the recent changes to reduce the load of dailies by speeding up activities and only requiring a single Kurzan Frontline/Chaos Dungeon per character each day. Any further infractions or violations will result in the permanent ban being reinstated. RMT Bans Do not engage in real-money trading of in-game items and in-game currencies. RMT Bans have and will, continue to rollout in an ongoing basis. We have seen a lot of community conversations discussing the bans, along with false narratives being publicly shared, so we wanted to provide a few reminders and clarifications. First off, RMT investigations are thoroughly vetted and manually looked into. Oftentimes, players are not willing to share the entire truth after engaging in behavior violating the Code of Conduct, which can lead to speculation and confusion in the community. Additionally, ban/suspension appeals are manually reviewed, not automatically declined. While there are response templates built to communicate a decision, they are not automatically sent out. These responses can be sent out quickly to communicate decisions after an appeal is reviewed, especially in cases where the evidence of illicit activities is concrete, or when the appeal provided was not relevant to the reason for the ban. If you ever in doubt of whether or not an action is allowed, please review the Amazon Games Code of Conduct or Terms of Service. Thank you for your continued support, and we’ll see you in Arkesia.",1742850175,
1599340,Wildsoul Design Process - Behind the Scenes,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/5iTTajdHWWMe8vKEi4q85e/c93e7a95d979b48cea39197e19307579/LA_Wildsoul_BTS_Art_Final_1920x1080_CT-000017156.jpg Heroes of Arkesia, We sat down with the Smilegate RPG development team to explore how they crafted the latest Lost Ark Advanced Class: Wildsoul. A mischievous shapeshifter with a deep connection to nature, Wildsoul blends illusion magic, animal transformations, and raw combat power into a fast-paced, strategic playstyle. From her dual-animal spirit magic to her playful yet powerful sound design, here’s how Wildsoul was brought to life. Q: Wildsoul is a really unique addition to the game. What makes her stand out? Dev Team: Most Yoz inherit a single animal spirit, which shapes their abilities and even their physical traits. Wildsoul? She’s an exception—a once-in-a-century phenomenon who possesses two spirits: the raw power of a bear and the cunning agility of a fox. This dual connection makes her incredibly powerful but also unstable, which is why she seals her abilities inside a mystical scroll. It’s the only way she can contain her magic—until she needs to unleash it in battle. That’s when things get really interesting. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/MQb3yDCUmUfQta2SFnmx6/7d2563fecd02cea5b5d85196d1fd58aa/LA_Wildsoul_BTS_Art_Final_1920x1080_CT-000017156.jpg Q: Let’s talk about that magic—how does Wildsoul’s power actually work? Dev Team: She has two core abilities: illusion magic and shapeshifting. Illusion magic lets her summon spectral beasts—a massive bear charging through enemies, a fox darting between attacks, or a murder of crows creating pure chaos. These summons feel like living creatures, acting as an extension of her spirit. She doesn’t just summon animals—she becomes them. In bear form, she’s a force of nature, dealing heavy, ground-shaking attacks. In fox form, she’s lightning-fast, weaving through enemies and striking with deadly precision. What makes her fun to play is that she can seamlessly switch forms mid-battle, adapting to whatever the situation demands. One moment she’s evading, the next she’s overwhelming enemies with sheer strength. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/4y6npbtykeOYW0cz9FXm8Z/27867f3af7c60f05f9a531226eb0e334/LA_Wildsoul_BTS_Art_Final_1920x1080_CT-000017156.jpg Q: Her design feels really distinct—what were the inspirations behind her look? Dev Team: From the start, we wanted Wildsoul to fully embody the spirit of the Yoz—a culture deeply connected to nature, illusion magic, and spiritual energy. Her look had to reflect that, but in a way that made her feel truly unique. We drew inspiration from a variety of cultural aesthetics and traditions, blending these elements to create a character with a rich and distinctive identity. Her clothing and accessories incorporate natural materials, layered fabrics, and intricate patterns, all designed to reflect her deep connection to the land. Since Rimeria, the homeland of the Yoz, is close to Anikka, we also wove in subtle Eastern influences to show the cultural exchange between these regions. The result is a character that feels like she truly belongs in the world, while still standing out as one of its rarest warriors. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/4ypnbIb8pRIFCGOV2ZhqKw/fbc0754b64f8b4db36b21be56f13dad5/LA_Wildsoul_BTS_Art_Final_1920x1080_CT-000017156.jpg Q: Let’s talk about sound—what went into designing Wildsoul’s audio? Dev Team: We wanted her sound design to reflect her playful but powerful personality. She’s mischievous, a little unpredictable, but never to be underestimated. For example, in her “Ursine Windup” attack, she lets out a slight struggle sound as she swings her arm—because let’s be honest, swinging a giant bear claw isn’t easy! But when she lands the hit? Boom. The impact makes it clear—this is a character who hits hard. Her “Swish Bear” transformation starts with a soft, mystical hum, which then deepens into a low, resonant vibration once she fully shifts. Meanwhile, her fox form is all about quick, sharp sounds, emphasizing her agility. Even her animal cries—from the fox’s call to the crow’s caw—were carefully tuned to feel real but slightly magical. We wanted every sound to reinforce the idea that Wildsoul is skilled at illusion and a powerhouse, and we’re really happy with how it all came together. Q: Finally, why should players be excited to play Wildsoul? Dev Team: If you love fast-paced, strategic combat, Wildsoul is for you. She’s not a straightforward tank, nor is she a typical rogue—she’s a shapeshifter and an illusionist, all in one. It has been an exciting several weeks since the Wildsoul’s launch in Arkesia, with players leveling up and battle the Demon Legions in new ways with Wildsoul. Now’s the perfect time to take part in the ongoing progression events and make the most of her arrival. From the Powerpass to Mokoko Challenge Express, these events offer valuable rewards, boosts, and resources to help you level up your Wild...",1742489256,

1599340,Class Spotlight: Wildsoul — Unleash the Wildsoul Within,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/4uDVFm941E8oWD4ThlXM9j/bd3aee119571455aba91afed349f8ed0/LA_Wildsoul_Transform_Final_1920x1080_CT-000000000.jpg The call of the wild is relentless, a force that cannot be ignored. Those who answer it become more than warriors; they become legends. Introducing the Wildsoul class, arriving in Arkesia on February 26th, a striking new addition that embodies the raw, unbridled energy of nature’s fiercest protectors. Whether you harness the spirit of the celestial or revel in the shadows of the unknown, this class is a testament to the balance of grace, power, and primal might. Players eager to unlock Wildsoul’s full potential can embark on a Class Awakening Quest, earning 15 new achievements, a new title, and a new trophy, along with a Training Room Guide to help refine their skills. But the Wildsoul class is more than just aesthetics. Wildsoul warriors channel their connection to nature through two distinct specializations: Transformation and Spirit Beast Summoning, offering an adaptable and exhilarating combat experience. CLASS PLAYSTYLE & IDENTITY Wild Soul is a Specialist Advanced Class that revolves around a unique three-meter identity system, enabling players to shift between Bear, Fox, and Phantom Beast Awakening forms. The class features two primary playstyles: Phantom Beast Awakening (Swiftness/Crit–Non-Transformation Focused) A fast-paced, high-tempo build that focuses on skill cycling and identity gauge management, allowing for near-constant uptime on powerful buffs. High mobility and low cooldowns, similar to Reflux Sorceress. Stacks Essence Buff while in the Phantom Beast Awakening form, then consumes stacks with the Identity Skill (Z) for: Cooldown Reduction (5% per stack). Mana Recovery (2% per stack). A high-speed combat loop Fill the identity gauge. Activate Phantom Beast Awakening Form. Cycle skills rapidly. Consume stacks for cooldown resets. Repeat. Wild Instincts (Specialization/Crit–Transformation-Based) A burst-focused playstyle that shifts between Bear and Fox forms, utilizing a powerful fourth skill mechanic for massive damage boosts. Bear Form: Tanks damage and gains damage reduction. Fox Form: Increases attack speed for faster skill execution. Every fourth skill cast within transformation receives a 40% damage boost. Gameplay loop: Alternate between Bear and Fox forms. Build identity. Use a fourth skill for burst. Temporarily exit transformation to regenerate the gauge. Repeat. CLASS CHARACTERISTICS Wild Soul strikes a balance between survivability and offensive versatility, offering: Class Synergy: Applies a 12% defense reduction debuff to enemies. Tanky Survivability: 2.1 HP coefficient and 100% defense scaling (similar to Slayer and Artillerist). Innate Critical Damage Scaling: Similar to Aeromancer, Wild Soul has baked-in critical damage bonuses. Flexible Skill System: Similar to Breaker, Wild Soul’s skills automatically shift forms based on activation. Skill Types: Green Skills: Exit transformation and regenerate identity gauge. Yellow Skills: Bear Form abilities. Blue Skills: Fox Form abilities. Unique Identity Gauge: Tracks three meters, dynamically shifting based on the active transformation. The Phantom Beast Awakening Form lasts 30 seconds, with a stackable Essence Buff mechanic. A Warrior in Harmony with Nature Wildsoul fighters are more than just skilled combatants; they are guardians of the natural order, channeling the essence of the wilderness into their every move. They strike with the precision of a predator and move with the fluidity of the wind, making them unpredictable foes and invaluable allies. Their connection to the land gives them heightened reflexes, the ability to adapt in battle, and an unmatched resilience that allows them to thrive in even the most chaotic encounters. Transformation Specialization: This path enables the Wildsoul to morph into powerful animal forms, such as a bear or fox, each offering unique abilities and combat styles. As the Wildsoul uses transformation skills, they accumulate specific meters corresponding to each form. Building up these meters allows the player to unleash potent finishing moves, delivering devastating damage to enemies. Additionally, maintaining transformation stacks provides various buffs, including passive healing, increased attack speed, and the application of armor break synergies, enhancing both personal and party performance in battle. Spirit Beast Summoning Specialization: In this build, the Wildsoul focuses on summoning ethereal spirit beasts to aid in combat. By utilizing spirit beast skills, players fill a unique meter that, once maxed, can be activated to enter an “Awakened” state. During this state, the Wildsoul experiences increased attack and movement speed, as well as a significant boost in critical damage. Landing spirit beast skills in this mode generates orbs that can be collected to restore mana and reset skill cooldowns, allowing for sustained offensive capab...",1740082697,
1599340,Team Update - Upcoming Events & Policies,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/S6BJEfpViKePsxPCYvBfz/b657ea9d2d2d83ca08152c16185c3a45/LA_JumpStart_Gift_1920x1080_CT-002631.jpg Heroes of Arkesia, We have seen a lot of community discussion over the past few months and wanted to take a moment to clarify our stance on bussing related topics and some policy adjustments. First, we’ll cover some details for the upcoming update, and then dive into policy adjustments built to make the party-finder tool a better experience. February Updates Wildsoul + Progression Events The latest class— Wildsoul— will arrive alongside progression events built to support it, including a South Kurzan Powerpass, the latest Mokoko Express event, and a third event in the works (spoiler alert, expect some help with Advanced Honing). We typically see a higher volume of returning players for new class releases and progression events, and want to ensure that they are not only supported by in-game systems, but also the broader Lost Ark community. Mokoko Bootcamp To help further teach these players the ropes, or brush up on rusty raiding skills, we are bringing back the Mokoko Bootcamp Event. Community feedback coming out of the event’s debut was extremely helpful, and something we will continue to look at coming out of the second iteration of the event. We are looking into longer-term solutions to make the event a permanent system in the game, but weren’t ready to roll out those changes in time for the Wildsoul release and progression events. This version of the Mokoko Bootcamp will include players who had not logged-in within the last 60 days, or created a new account within the last 60 days, and who are under Item Level 1670. For the more permanent solution, we will continue to evaluate what defines a Mokoko. This event will run for a few months, similar to the initial iteration (with some refreshed and updated rewards) as we continue to monitor in-game data and player feedback on our path to making it a more permanent system. Players will notice overhauls to the rewards, including a new special “Mokoko Legion Commander” title. We saw a lot of feedback on the volume of other available rewards, and will be juicing those up to ensure the event is worthwhile to all players. And, as we know you’re curious, while the event itself will not give away a Relic Engraving Selector, there will be one arriving for players elsewhere in the February update. We hope the special chase items along with increased honing and other progression materials will make it worthwhile for all. We’re looking forward to seeing how this event helps support new and returning players joining for the February update, and will be monitoring your feedback as we look to solidify the future of Mokoko Bootcamp. Party Finder Policy Adjustments & Reminders Given the context discussed around supporting returning players and coupled with the return of the Mokoko Bootcamp, we will no longer permit the promotion of bussing and other services from the in-game party-finder tool. Our goal is to foster a better party-finder experience for new or returning players where they can better find learning groups with each other, or find a veteran party willing to show a Mokoko the ropes in exchange for Mokoko Bootcamp event tokens. For the first two weeks (beginning tomorrow, February 18), players violating the new policy will receive a 15-minute suspension as a first time reminder and warning, with subsequent penalties beginning at 1 day, with escalating penalties (up to week-long and then month-long suspensions) for repeat offenses. After the two week period concludes, suspensions for violating the policy will begin at 1 day, and then follow the escalating penalties for repeat offenses. Spamming chat (such as Area Chat) with promotions will also incur the same penalty. Bussing in Lost Ark has always been an “at your own risk” activity. Gold, items, or materials accepted from other players may be attached to a bad faith history, and subject for removal. Players may receive penalties if they receive illicit items, as it can be hard to verify the intention for payments that included gold generated from bots or past RMT, and will need to appeal the decision with appropriate evidence. As a final note while we’re talking about making the Party Finder a more welcoming experience, we wanted to provide a reminder that offering piloting services is a serious offense and will incur corresponding penalties, including permanent bans.",1739835197,

These community competitions have shown a mix of entertaining moments and mesmerizing gameplay in a celebration of the range of Lost Ark’s raiding community. On February 16 at 12p.m. PST, the next Whambly will take place— a race to see who can conquer the Brelshaza Kazeros Raid as fast as possible. We’re excited to announce we will be supporting this community-led competition by providing Stoopzz and Saintone with codes they can give to the winners, participants, and lucky viewers who tune in during the event. Winner Codes: A Relic Engraving Selection Chest 2,000x Abidos Fusion Materials 3,000x Destiny Leapstones 100x Destiny Shard bags (M) (200k shards) Participant and Viewer Codes: Leap Legendary Selection Card Pack II x 1 100x Abidos Fusion Materials 100x Destiny Leapstones 25x Destiny Shard Pouches (M) (50k shards) With valuable caches of rewards up for grabs, or available for viewers to randomly receive, don’t miss out on the spectacle or prizes— especially with the Wildsoul Class arriving later this month!

1599340,Lost Ark 2025 Roadmap - Part 1,"https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/EejTfQIoRy87VLZFdt4G4/5d4f74100edde328f444f11a4107951e/EN_LA_Roadmap_Part_1_1920x1080.jpg Heroes of Arkesia, We’re excited to share a first look at December and the first few months of next year with the first part of the 2025 Roadmap! Join Lost Ark team members Henry and Roxx for a discussion of the key content arriving in December 2024 through March 2025. The roadmap content discussed are highlights we know players are eagerly awaiting, but the roadmap is not a comprehensive list of every change arriving in Arkesia over the next few months, and could change. As we approach each month, more details will be shared. Stay tuned to our website and social channels for future Release Notes, including the full list of new content, cosmetics, content balance changes, events, and more included in our major monthly updates. December 2024 https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/2RR8Tg4UPLYH9TAE0q8v38/653230bf9c996305cfcfb0e20f4a16c7/LA_Roadmap_DEC_1920x1080.jpg There are some big changes coming in December alongside their releases in Korea that we’re excited to reveal. The full release notes will arrive on December 17 with the full details and content arriving this month. The following list is a summary of key updates. Solo Mode Update Prepare to challenge notorious threats solo for the first time, with the Thaemine Legion Raid and Echidna Kazeros Raid added to the roster of raids available in Solo Mode. An update to Solo Mode will also be added, including a new buff system and cost reductions to the “View More Rewards”. Kazeros Raid: Act 2 Prologue The prologue quest covers the story of how the Allied Forces begins a new strategy to overcome the current situation for the ongoing war in North Kurzan. As you progress through the prologue quest, you will learn the new strategy of the Allied Forces and after fighting Aegir, as we head toward the battle against Narok and Brelshaza. Elixir & Transcendence Adjustments The Elixir progression system has been overhauled to make Elixir transmutation faster and less strategic to simplify the experience. The Transcendence system has been overhauled to simplify the progression path. Proving Grounds Season 6 Proving Ground Season 6 will begin in December. Prove you’re one of the best warriors in Arkesia to earn season ranks, rewards, and prestige in Season 6 of competitive Proving Grounds. Icy Breakthrough Event A new mission-based progression event arrives, built to help players progress through the beginning of Tier 4. It’s a great continuation of the ongoing Hyper Awakening Road Event, and will help with progression in early Tier 4. There are four categories of missions: Weapon Honing Armor Honing Clearing Echidna Gates Clearing Behemoth Gates The honing missions will grant Hellfire Honing Books and Gold as you hone your gear over Item Level 1640. The Echidna missions will grant Agris’ Scales, Alcaone’s Eye, and additional support materials, and the Behemoth missions will grant Behemoth’s Scales and Weapon Transcendence Restoration Tickets. January 2025 https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/5NKbjIBvZ3rTNbJkfpc3f8/7a9ff158c84e0b79f263d4d2ebddfb81/LA_Roadmap_JAN_1920x1080.jpg Kazeros Raid Act 2: Requiem of the Floating Nightmare Face off against Brelshaza once more in Kazeros Raid Act 2: Requiem of the Floating Nightmare. This raid will require 8-players, and take place in a harsh, icy battleground, which provides the perfect backdrop for Brelshaza’s own chilling new powers. In Gate 1, the Valley of Piercing Screams, you’ll have to fight the intimidating Narok the Butcher, and in Gate 2, Phantom Apeiron, you’ll see the familiar Brelshaza with some new abilities. This raid will also introduce the Karma System, which will allow players to receive new ways to power up their characters. Normal Mode will be available at Item level 1670, and Hard Mode will be available at Item Level 1690. We will include the latest improvements to the raid applied in Korea, such as showing targeting effect during certain patterns in Gate 1. Along with Brelshaza, a host of new Tier 4 content will arrive, including the release of Tier 4 Bracelets, a new Guardian, Abidos Operation, a Chaos Gate for players over Item Level 1680, and the 2nd Unlock of the T4 Ebony Cube. Frontier System When the frontier system is applied, raid difficulty (damage and HP) will decrease for raid bosses as stage of the frontier progresses. The stages progress automatically as time goes on. With the frontier system, parties clearing cutting-edge content can enjoy a similar difficulty to Korea when the raid releases, and others can enjoy an easier version as time passes; making the raid more approachable for more casual players while also lessening the reclear difficulty. Third Anniversary Celebration Lost Ark Anniversary celebrations will kick off a little bit early this year, coming in with our update at the end of January. This will allow us to get celebrating sooner, and pave th...",1734294948,

1599340,October 30 Release Notes,"Heroes of Arkesia, During weekly maintenance a new event will be added and Server Transfers will be enabled for Ignite players to move to Legacy Servers. Downtime will begin on October 30 at 12am PT (7am UTC) and is expected to last 5 hours. Learn about the new event and transfer experience below. Mokoko Bootcamp Event The Mokoko Bootcamp Event runs from October 30th to January 15th, 2025 and is designed to encourage veteran players to play dungeons with new or returning players. New and returning players whose highest Item Level character on their account is below Item Level 1660 can earn ""Mokoko Tokens"" for completing dungeons during the event period. These new and returning players will have a ""green leaf"" icon in the recruitment panel. Green leaf Mokoko players will be those who meet one of the following conditions: A new account that has been created within the event period Accounts that have been created within 60 days before the event start date Accounts with a previous Login Date over 60 days before the event start date Once a player acquires the “green leaf”, it will persist until the end of the event, but will expire when any of the characters in that player’s account is over Item Level 1660. Veteran players, defined as active players not belonging to the categories above, can earn ""Expert Tokens"" when they complete dungeons together with the new/returning players. Both the Mokoko Tokens and Expert Tokens can then be exchanged for rewards, with the number of Tokens earned varying based on which specific dungeons are completed. As long as there is at least one new/returning player in the group, the entire team qualifies to earn the respective Tokens. The reward tables will be slightly different for new players and returning players, but both reward tables will have both weekly and once-per-roster items. Both groups will have access to honing materials and even Metallurgy/Tailoring: Hellfire honing books to help hone in Tier 4. Mokoko Tokens will better help newer players get caught up on things like cards and other methods of progression. The Expert Tokens will grant endgame items, including a Relic Engraving Selection chest, and a “Mokoko General” title with a special icon title for helping new players out! Ignite Server Transfer The transfer window allowing Ignite players to transfer a single character to Legacy servers will open with the update, and will remain open until November 25. There are two types of transfers: Roster Transfer (better for new players) - move some roster level information to a server without an existing roster, along with the chosen character. Character Transfer (better for returning or active players) - merge your chosen Ignite character into an existing roster. To view what will (or will not) transfer with each type of transfer, visit our Ignite Servers Merge Policy Page. We’re excited to welcome new and returning Ignite players to Legacy Servers as reinforcements in the fight against Kazeros. New threats will be able to be challenged in the North Kurzan storyline, Behemoth Epic Raid, and the Echidna and Aegir Kazeros Raids. In the meantime, we’ll see you in Arkesia! ",1730222250,

1599340,Game-breaking Lost Ark exploit prompts severe punishments from Amazon,"If there's one thing everyone hates, it's cheaters. Whether it's FPS players with head-popping aimbots, or ones that abuse in-game bugs for their own gain, cheaters are a genuine scourge. Amazon's flashy action MMO <strong>Lost Ark</strong> is no stranger to bad actors - over one million bans have been handed out since its release, and there are ongoing issues with botting. Over the past few days, there's been yet another bug which, in turn, has led to players exploiting the Stronghold on Ignite servers. Amazon has been quick to act, however, bringing down a pretty nasty ban hammer. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark-online/ignite-server-chest-exploit"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/10-best-pc-mmos"">The best MMO and MMORPGs to play in 2024</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark-online/endgame-content-solo"">Lost Ark will finally let you solo endgame raids in new update</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/lost-ark-online/summer-heat-update"">Free to play MMO Lost Ark shows off huge new summer heat update</a> ",1729605568,
1599340,Team Update: Addressing the Reward Exploit,"Heroes of Arkesia, A bug was identified with Ignite reward chests, which some players were able to repeatedly exploit. Our team has been investigating the extent of the issue, and wanted to communicate our decision on the penalty for those who abused the exploit. As a reminder, a key tenet of the Amazon Games Code of Conduct is to “Play Fair”. We reserve the right to determine what constitutes unfair play and to take corrective action we deem appropriate, and the abuse of this exploit will have corrective action taken, with suspensions and bans already sent out. General Policy Slightly over 2,300 players received rewards chests from the Ignite Stronghold reward issue. Within this group, over 1,200 did not open any of the reward chests. The group that did not open any reward chests will not have any action taken against their accounts apart from removing the unopened chests from their inventory. For the remaining 1,000 players who opened the reward chests, the severity of the penalty will directly correspond to the level of bug exploitation. At a base level, all items will be removed and skill tree levels will be rolled back. For items that were used and cannot be removed, players may have gold (or the gold value of the used items) deducted from their balance, or be sent into the negatives corresponding to the severity of the abuse. This policy will apply to all materials, including processed chaos stones and combined honing materials. Along with the item withdrawals, players will be receiving suspensions and bans matching their level of exploit. The first group are players who may have mistakenly encountered the issue and did not repeatedly abuse the bug. Players who opened 1 or 2 chests will have any items withdrawn and have not been suspended/banned at this time. Our team is investigating if we can remove the items for this group during maintenance. If the item removal process is gauged to take longer than the maintenance period, this group of players will receive a short suspension to give our team the time needed to remove the items. Spending these items in the meantime will result in further action, such as gold removal. Players who continually exploited the issue and opened multiple reward chests will have more severe action taken, corresponding to their level of exploit. Players that opened 3 - 7 chests will receive a two-week suspension. Players that opened 8 - 14 chests will receive a 1-month suspension. Players that opened 15+ chests will receive a notice that they have received a 30-day suspension and are pending further review. This group will have various levels of action taken, up to permanent bans from the game. Issue Resolution To stop exploitation of the main reward issue and other bugs, access to strongholds was disabled. For players who have a character stuck in a stronghold, and need access to that character immediately, please submit a customer support ticket. Otherwise, the issue will be resolved during maintenance for the October 23 update. We will also re-enable the use of the Ignite reward chests at this time for players on Ignite Servers. Based on our policies and investigation, we believe this is the best course of action. We know many players were concerned about the outcome, and we wanted to be clear with our approach. In the future, if you encounter an issue you believe is an exploit or unintended issue, do not engage with the issue (no matter how tempting it may seem) and report it to our teams. We appreciate those who reported the issue, along with your patience while members our team investigated and blocked access to certain in-game systems. While this issue gained high visibility in the community, we hope this policy is clear and allows us to move forward together. We are always open to community feedback, and welcome you to engage in the conversation on our official channels. There are still key moments coming to Arkesia this week, with Aegir’s arrival and Ignite Server transfers arriving. Those aren’t the only things arriving in the update— stay tuned for the full release notes on Tuesday. In the meantime, we’ll see you in Arkesia. ",1729552615,

Machinist Drone skills will now do their appropriate damage. The 'Time Together' weapons skins for the Wardancer and Scrapper classes will now display as intended.

The time for the Allied Forces to gather in North Kurzan and unite in battle against Kazeros’ demonic legions has arrived. The battle in North Kurzan will serve as the entry point to Tier 4 (T4), Lost Ark’s endgame evolution, which introduces a multitude of new endgame systems for players to power up before facing the many challenges on the near horizon. The vast array of new gear, systems, and abilities aren’t the only thing that will help you power up to face Kazeros’ forces — reinforcements are also critical to overcoming the demonic hordes. To bolster the ranks of players ready to enter Tier 4, a special progression event arrives in the form of Ignite Servers. These special servers will quickly level players up to 1620 and give them the tools to enter the fray. Additionally, to give players a major power increase in Tier 4, Hyper Awakenings will also be included in this update! Downtime will begin on October 9 at 12 a.m. PT (7 a.m. UTC) and is expected to last 15 hours.

1599340,Gear Up For Aegir,"Heroes of Arkesia, The Arkesia Ignited Update arrives on October 9, heralding a new age for new and veteran players alike. The time for the Allied Forces to gather in North Kurzan and unite in battle against Kazeros’ demonic legions will soon begin. This month, our plans will work a little differently than a normal Lost Ark update. While the major update will arrive on October 9 releasing Tier 4, North Kurzan, Ignite Servers, and much more, the colossal threat Aegir will be arriving in a new raid two weeks later, on October 23. This 2-gate Kazeros Raid will require you to face off against dangerous threats, with Akkan returning for a fight in the first Gate, and Aegir appearing as your foe in the second Gate. As Tier 4 will take time to fully progress through and unlock its full potential, we wanted to give you a first look at some of the builds and character power you’ll be able to experience in Tier 4. We’re partnering with 8 current and returning Lost Ark content creators to host a special event on Twitch on October 8, beginning at 11AM PT (6PM UTC). In the event, participants will be collaborating to challenge Aegir with full Tier 4 gear and Ark Passive enabled to show audiences what true endgame power looks like.

Each participant will have a Twitch Drop enabled only for the duration of the raid, so don’t miss your chance to snag some extra goods to help you in your journey. Heading toward the Gear Up For Aegir Livestream, we’ll reveal participants and the Twitch Drops!

To ensure we don’t give away the surprise early, the Arkesia Ignited Release Notes will drop after the special announcement is made during the livestream, a few hours after our normal time.

During this time, additional adjustments will be made to EAC. Downtime is estimated to last up to 4 hours. Following the maintenance period, all players will receive a gift in their product inventories to help them continue through the Transcendence System as Tier 4 approaches! We’ve seen a lot of feedback from the community and reviewed player data surrounding the western balance changes to Behemoth. With the changes to Transcendence and Elixirs that also arrived with the ‘Chase The Storm’ update, we’ve seen feedback that newer 1620 characters are struggling with damage contribution or are being gatekept due to their Transcendence level. While Behemoth is clearable with a party of 1620s, we wanted to provide a gift to help players juice their characters up for the raid in response to the feedback we’ve seen. We looked into slightly tweaking the balance, but Tier 4’s imminent arrival on October 9 will provide an immediate and substantial Item Level boost for 1620 characters using the gear transfer system. We would rather you feel powered-up with lasting effects, such as some help progressing through the Transcendence System. We also hope that the in-game Chase The Storm event continues to help you power up your roster. To support that goal, the “Behemoth Buster” player gift will contain the following: 30 Armor Transcendence Restoration Tickets 10 Weapon Transcendence Restoration Tickets Master's Herb Steaks Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you in Arkesia soon!
