We apologize for any inconvenience caused.① Fatigue, Weekly Quests, and Doom will refresh one day earlier (along with the season update). Please plan your time wisely!② Doom Speedrun challenges will close after the server maintenance in the final week of the Windstorm Season. All rewards will still be issued during the regular settlement window.③ The standard rules apply for Yama's Abyss Leaderboard.

Charged dash attacks can be countered.2. \ Adjustment: Temulch recovers Stamina more quickly while in his Storm Prison.3. Deleted the Skill \.4. Deleted the Ultimate \.//Dev Note: Temulch's overall combat performance has remained solid, but his Talent choices have been relatively rigid. This update focuses on strengthening his underused Talents. When selecting the Ultimate \, Temulch can now perform a mid-air dash attack while airborne within the storm prison. Tap Release: Enables a follow-up combo attack after hitting the target. Charged Release: Unleashes a Golden Focused weapon attack that knocks back enemies.Considering that enemy Stamina recovery is significantly slowed within the storm prison, making it difficult to counter Temulch's charged dash attack through dodging, this move is designed to be blockable by Countering. However, a successful Counter will not trigger a Counterstrike Combo. II. Shayol Wei1. When \ is triggered while using \, a counterattack is stored. Counterattacks no longer remove \. If no enemy is marked, Shayol will perform a quick forward slash instead.2.

We suggest you log out in advance and enter the game again after the maintenance. The details for this update are as follows: Brand New Content I. New Showdown Gameplay: Tempered Inferno In the Soul-forging Abyss hidden in the Shadowjade Mine, the ""Chaos Furnace"" that once refined the legendary weapons of the Herald used to be alight day and night. However, under the mad scheme of Omnius, a drastic change occurred. After Omnius's plan to revert the Five Phases back to primordial chaos was foiled by the heroes, some formless chaotic Qi escaped and seeped into the Chaos Furnace. A bursting of energy flooded out because of the imbalanced Five Elements within, attracting countless evil spirits into action. Thus, a battle to protect the furnace began. In this crisis, the heroes used Chaos Stones crafted by the Chaos Furnace to forge Curios imbued with the powers of Yin and Yang. These Curios then became their weapons to slay demons and eradicate evils. However, as the energy of the Chaos Furnace continued to leak, the furnace fire gradually weakened. The heroes who sought more Curios could only wait for the Five Phases True Qi to return to balance on the Morus Isle before they could once again awaken the Furnace. Defeat waves of enemies, claim numerous prizes, and revel in the power of the Curios! II. New Showdown Item: Curio Each hero has two Curio slots: Yin and Yang. One Curio can be equipped in each slot. 1. Crafting Curios Chaos Stones, acquired in Tempered Inferno, can be used to craft Curios. There are two kinds of Curio crafting: Random Craft and Targeted Craft. : produces a random Curio of the current season, and builds XP to boost its Crafting level. : Once you have raised a given Curio to Lv. 1, you'll be able to choose to craft that Curio using . At the end of the season, Curios will be reclaimed, but Crafting Levels will be retained. In following seasons, players with Crafting levels will be able to craft Curios from past seasons. From time to time we will hold Rerun Events for players who missed out. During the season, each Curio Crafting level you upgrade will increase the season progress by 1. Season progress rewards include Flux Shards, Curio crafting materials and more! 2. Curio Stars Curios can be smelted into Chaos Extract, a resource used in leveling up Curios. Each level gained grants an attribute of a random quality and type (that the Curio does not already have). A Curio can have at most 4 attributes. 3. Awakening Curios and Harmonic Balance Extreme Curio raised to 3-Star level can be awakened with Tempered Essence. If successful, the Curio gains random awakened attributes (these differ between Curios). Failure will result in the loss of the lowest-quality or lowest-level attribute. You can still raise the Curio's stars to get a new attribute. Each failure boosts your awakening chance across all Curios. With both an awakened Yin and Yang Curio, you unlock for all your heroes (whether you have the Curios equipped or not), boosting your Luck by 2,000, and your team's by 1,000. Boosts can stack. Lasts until Tempered Inferno reopens next season. III. Limited-time Event: Hunting Grounds Event Duration: Apr. 17, 2025 Update - May. 21, 2025 20:00 (UTC) Event Rules: 1.

Her ultimate move unleashes the power of a silk ball, delivering massive damage through techniques like Mighty Smash and Aerial Strike. Drawing from the ancient art of Chinese acrobatics, Lannie's combat style is a tribute to Chinese cultural heritage, designed to bring extra festivity to the Spring Festival celebrations. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/36350327/7038b86c9fd2996289f2a14825c998907de7d8da.png New Spring Festival Events Log in daily to receive new and exciting rewards from our Spring Festival celebration.

Each match is split into two halves, with teams taking turns playing as the Attackers and the Defenders. 2. During the first half, the Attackers must capture the Spirit Well, then summon and escort a Golden Roc to the destination to destroy a Border Stele. The Defenders must prevent this from happening. 3. In the second half, the teams swap roles and compete again. Victory Conditions 1. After swapping sides, the targets and allotted time for the second half will be adjusted based on how well Attackers did in the first half. 2. If the second-half attackers can match the first-half progress within a certain time limit, they win; otherwise, it's a tie or loss. Others 1. When defeated, select a Soul Altar on the map to revive. 2. Once the Spirit Well is captured, two Golden Rocs will appear with different routes. The Attackers only need to escort one of them to the destination. 3. The game will enter overtime if the Attackers are still within range of the Spirit Well or Golden Roc when regular match time expires. 4. Once overtime is up, the game will end immediately. 5. Soul Lantern: Across the map, you will find Soul Lanterns that can be activated to restore your Armor, Health, and Rage. Additionally, they provide a temporary boost to your Attack and Melee Resist.

Catch-Up Points Upon finishing a stage with at least 15 Fatiguecost, the Souljade reward targets you've failed to meet will be granted as Catch-Up Points.

Catch-Up Points are not carried over from week to week, and are reset to 0 every Wednesday 20:00 (UTC) Newly added Hero Badge: Against All Odds, serves as a counter for the matches where you've earned Catch-Up Points. By upgrading the Hero Badge, you will get Carved Crystal, Souljade Fragment, Exhilarating Elixir, Flux Shards as rewards. //Dev Note: We have been closely monitoring the loot experience since the launch of Showdown mode. In this mode, luck significantly influences the results because the loot distribution is inherently random. So, when there is a significant disparity between the effort invested and the rewards received, it may lead to disappointment. We are introducing a new catch-up points feature to compensate for lower rewards when luck isn't on your side. At the same time, this preserves the experience of earning greater rewards when luck is favorable. As a result, the overall loot rewards have been improved. 6. Season Settlements Deepwood Season will end on December 5, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC) (1) Season Rewards: Rank Requirement Rewards Avatar Avatar Avatar Avatar Avatar , *2, *5 Avatar , *3, *10, Hero Badge \ Avatar , *5, *15, Hero Badge Avatar , *10, *20, Hero Badge (2) Showdown Leaderboard Rewards: Players will be rewarded with an Avatar that corresponds to the highest rank that they held on the Yama's Abyss leaderboards at any point during this Showdown Deepwood Season (recorded either at weekly settlement or at season settlement). Additionally, the top 3 players on any Yama's Abyss Hero leaderboard will receive an exclusive Hero Badge. II. Showdown Tutorial: The Beginning Clouds hung over Morus Isle, as dark as ink. Thunder rumbled and boomed. It felt as if all the energy in the world was beginning to stir...

1203220,New Hero Cyra Available on Oct 30th,"Happy Halloween, Forerunners! For this year’s celebration you’ll get to enjoy unforgettable events brimming with dance parties, exclusive themed items available only during this event, alongside new costumes and gameplay modes. Dive into a festive atmosphere filled with spooky surprises. For the first time, the event features culturally inspired Halloween-themed cosmetics, adding an exciting layer of diversity and style, alongside fresh gameplay modes that promise to elevate your adventure further. Here’s what we have to offer: New Hero: Cyra We will introduce Cyra, a former Temple of Light and Shadow priestess turned hero, on October 30 PT. Raised with a strong faith as an orphan, her beliefs were shaken after uncovering a dark secret involving her orphanage, leading to a dramatic awakening of her latent powers during a fatal ritual, where she lost her memory. Determined, she embarked on a quest, eventually reaching Morus Isle. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/36350327/ab73fc2b58954f5b5c102a2ac52a135c481b5ab2.jpg Cyra’s abilities include casting orbs that explode to heal allies or damage enemies, and the ability to control the timing and targeting of the explosions. Her ultimate skills allow her to levitate, shield herself, and alternate her attacks between healing light beams and damaging, blinding explosive orbs. With her intriguing backstory and versatile abilities, Cyra is poised to add a new layer of strategy and depth to the NARAKA gameplay experience. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/36350327/a4f82132d266c2569fb68feff5e3fb8bd7ddc6bd.png New Cosmetic: Peculiar Tales Throughout the event, players can unlock new cosmetics based on mythological figures, each with distinct styles. Currently available are Kurumi's Aoandon-inspired outfit and Zai's Lucifer-themed look, complete with an Ult Special Effect Accessory. Hadi's attire, influenced by Hades and featuring a transformation accessory, will be available alongside a richly detailed witch-themed Grappling Hook starting October 30. Additionally, a cosmetic based on YanWang will be unveiled soon. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/36350327/dfc5b9d4e7f337c3ec491a0f179e4d0e3c02fe3e.jpg New Gameplay on Fairyland Penglai Starting October 30th, Fairyland Penglai, our in-game 3D Lobby, will be revamped with a Halloween twist. It will be complete with thematic music, dance options, and seasonal activities, this engaging space invites players to mingle, interact, and revel in the holiday festivities. New Hungry Dragons Mode: We're refreshing the classic Snake Game mode - Hungry Dragons with a unique deathmatch twist where kills make your koi fish-shaped snake longer. Surviving the arena means dodging traps, utilizing tactical items for speed and skill recharges, and staying clear of large attacks. Growth brings power, but keep your lengthening tail safe. Stay alert! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/36350327/982d3541da491fbff86ac4c4440cdcb284b9ceb1.jpg ",1730340636,

New Hero: Cyra The chief Divine Healer, the Saint of Dawn. Cyra was widely considered a Lunazran treasure. Yet her former glory and good name were lost, replaced by biting criticism and cruel rumors.

Cyra is ready to do whatever it takes, entirely unwavering in her quest to champion the Light. II. New Casual Mode The new Hungry Dragons mode is now available!
