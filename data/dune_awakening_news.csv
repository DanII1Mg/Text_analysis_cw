1172710,Major new feature and a free surprise,"Greetings Sleepers, Another patch is now available, and it's a hot one! Store your spice, park your vehicle and head back inside to sip a hot spice coffee while you take a gander at today’s patch highlights. You can also read the full patch notes here.  Gift of the Sands Free Pack As a heartfelt thank you for being part of our journey, we’re excited to gift a special free pack to everyone who owns Dune: Awakening. Enjoy this holiday surprise from us! This pack features a variety of beautiful, new decorative items. The centrepiece is a strategy table and assorted miniatures to place “strategically”, such as a miniature ornithopter, faction miniatures and much more. Handy as you lay out your plans to influence the spice trade on Arrakis. It also features two new weapon skins, and, for those in seasonal spirit, a special holographic tree. Check out your free pack on its Steam store page!  Store your base and place it back out in its entirety, including all its content with the Base Reconstruction Tool.  You can now craft the Base Reconstruction Tool and aim it at your base to store it. Vehicles are not backed up with this new tool. For vehicles you can’t back up in your vehicle backup tool, we recommend disassembling them and storing their parts in your bank or base storage if you’re bringing them with you.   The process is similar to using the vehicle backup tool: it will immediately remove your entire base from the world, including everything placed directly on or inside it. Placing your base works differently from blueprints. The entire base will be spawned instantly, without the need for gathering and manual rebuilding, including all its contents. Additionally, there is a “snap to origin” feature that will try to place your base in the exact location from which you removed it.  For all the nitty-gritty details on how storing and placing work, be sure to check out our dedicated Base Reconstruction Tool Blog   Past Twitch Drop Vendors Vendors with a special inventory are waiting for new customers in both Arrakeen and Harko Village. These dedicated individuals will sell past Twitch Drops in exchange for your heard-earned Solaris. The first inventory rotation includes our Chapter 1 Twitch Drops, featuring 11 different pieces from our Observer building set. Some very cool options are the Observer Windows, Observer Columns, and the Observer Hatch.   Cargo Container for Ornithopters We’ve introduced a new cargo container designed for transporting large quantities of items or materials. You craft pieces which need to be assembled via a welding torch to build this special container. Once put together, it can be used via a carrier ornithopter for transportation.    You can access its storage through the bank/exchange interface or your base’s circuits system.  QoL changes and exploit preventions We are continuously working on quality of life improvements and have added an unstuck vehicle button to get you and your vehicle out of sticky situations. To assist you in sticky situations with your vehicle, we have introduced an “unstuck vehicle button” that should get you out to safety quickly.  We also made it easier for you to find relevant information after a new game update has been released.  Griefing alleviation We continuously commit resources to mitigate griefing and have put further prevention methods in place. Additionally, we fixed a known solari duplicate exploit. Thank you for being part of our community, Sleepers and may you find spice in abundance. ",1765891867,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1786767382_1765892785_0', 'ModAct_1301790999_1765894461_4', 'mod_require_rereview']"

1172710,Communinet Signal #10,"Opening WordsWelcome to the next Communinet Signal, Sleepers! We’ve got some exciting things to share in this issue including creations from the community, early concept art of the very hungry sandworm along with insight on the design by our Senior Designer John Wiksen, and a Q&A. Let’s get into it!Round UpDeveloper UpdateWe recently published a new developer update that talks about major upcoming changes including the Base Reconstruction Tool, Server Migrations, and some things you can expect in Chapter 3. This new chapter that will add more activities for both solo and co-op players, add new progression paths, as well as continue the main storyline.Read all about it here!Public Testing Client Patch 1.2.30.0Get in on testing the latest patch on our public testing client, where we have enabled character transfers. You can now move your character, inventory, base, and bank contents (including Solari) to a new Sietch and World!

Press the “esc” button, then click on “report bug” at the bottom right of the screen. You can find the PTC as a separate game in your Steam library.Read the full patch notes here!Developer Deep DiveYou can expect more developer content in this section in future Signals such as interviews, office shares, behind-the-scenes, concept art, and more. Our focus on this Signal will be an asset highlight! And what better way to introduce this section than with the iconic sandworm! Below you’ll find very early exploration concept images of the sandworm. This was when we were initially deciding how the tri-mouthed arrangement would look, its size, how it moved and so on.Here’s a fun fact: A huge inspiration for the design was taken from the original images of the sandworm that was drawn on the cover of the first edition book!The tri-mouth design has a lot of potential when it comes to silhouettes and ""personality"" in animation because it has more moving parts that are easy to manipulate. The much larger round-mouth sandworms also exist in the game, but these only in the Deep Desert.We asked our Senior Designer John Wiksen on his thoughts when it came to designing the tri-mouth sandworm,“In a game, players will have the camera generally lower to the ground, we can't just move the camera up and have cool shots of things as seen from above. So with the pointy mouth of the worm it is easier for players to recognize the worm if it breaches behind a dune or tries to swallow them from below compared to a ringmouth which has simpler lines.Other than that, there are some things in the concepts for the wormsign, that are seen where the worm moves when it is close to the surface. We really wanted this to be visible and something that players could spot from a distance so they would understand where a sandworm could be. Like looking to your left and right before crossing the street; you looked for wormsign before running across open sand.”Community CornerFan ContentLike in the previous Signal, anyone mentioned here will receive keys to the Atreides Battle Rifle. Take a gander at these amazing creations, and make sure to submit your own on Discord, Instagram, Reddit, X, BlueSky, or Threads!   Valka-arialitan on Tumblr and Discord has more wonderful art pieces.

A: Yes, the storage container does count towards your 10 vehicle limit.Q: What are the plans for endgame? A: There will be an endgame revamp with the release of chapter 3.

1172710,Developer Update – November 2025,"It’s time for another update from the dunes. In our last post, we covered several major improvements coming in the next patches, along with early details about the next chapter.  Base Reconstruction Tool A while back, we mentioned the Base Reconstruction Tool, something many of you have been excited about. The team is working hard on improvements based on your feedback, but we need a little more time to properly address all comments. As a result, this feature is shifting to the next update, arriving slightly later than originally planned.  Server Migrations We’ve also seen many questions about server migrations and character transfers, so we want to clarify how this will work.  As we approach the merge window, empty or low-population worlds will be marked in-game for closure. Players on these worlds will be able to migrate to their preferred world and sietch, bringing their bases, inventory and vehicles with them. More details are available in our recent blog post about the Base Reconstruction Tool.  If you miss the migration period, or have been away for a while, you will still be able to migrate later from the game’s main menu and bring bases, inventory and vehicles with you.  We understand how important server population and migration are to bring the best out of the game. Our first step is to give players the tools to move freely. This includes both the Base Reconstruction Tool and Character Transfers. While the Base Reconstruction Tool is moving to the next patch (not a hotfix), you should expect it soon. Once both tools are live, we’ll begin monitoring server populations and will share our merge plans well in advance so everyone can prepare. Our goal is simple: players should be able to move to their preferred world and sietch with their full base, inventory, and character progress intact.  Carrier Ornithopter Cargo Container With the recent addition of vehicle harnessing across maps, we’re now preparing the next step: the Cargo Container for the Carrier Ornithopter, arriving in just a few weeks. This large, ground-built container—assembled with the welding torch—can be picked up and transported by the Carrier, making large-scale material transport across the map far more efficient.Chapter 3  One of our key focuses for the next chapter is adding more activities for both solo and co-op players. Expect new progression paths, new locations to explore, and difficulty scaling that creates meaningful challenges for all playstyles. Chapter 3 will also continue the main storyline, and much more. We’ll have more to share in December, so stay tuned.  What topics would you like us to cover in the next Developer Update? Share your thoughts and questions with us on Discord, Reddit, and our social channels. We read everything, and your input continues to help shape the world of Arrakis.  Thank you for your passion and support, The Funcom Team ",1764255834,
1172710,Dune: Awakening - 1.2.20.4 Hotfix Patch Notes,"Hey Sleepers,This hotfix requires a client-side download. Remember to restart your Steam client if the download does not appear automatically for you. Servers will be coming back up shortly. For the list of known issues, please visit our Discord server or Steam discussion boards.FixesReverted a change introduced in 1.2.20.0 to NPC melee behavior. This change addressed an issue where some NPCs were not dashing out correctly after a slow blade attack penetrated their shield. This occurred when the attacker was using a short blade, regardless of the NPC's stamina level.While this is an intended change that aligns with our goal of making enemy NPCs behave more like players who adhere to the same combat engagement rules, without other balance adjustments they might not be as enjoyable for everyone as we’d like.We understand that some of you who enjoyed the new behavior might be disappointed and we can’t wait to bring it back along with the rest of the balance changes we have in store at a later date.",1764064825,['patchnotes']

1172710,Dune Awakening gives franchise fans and MMO skeptics a chance to try it for free with a generous new trial,"There have been a few decent Dune videogames over the years, but they've often been strategy-focused and limited in terms of fully immersing fans in Arrakis. <strong>Dune Awakening</strong>, however, is different from the rest.

The Lost Harvest DLC added a brand-new standalone storyline along with the treadwheel vehicle, Dune Man building pieces, and more. The Deep Desert has seen major improvements as well, both in Chapter 2 and in the many other content updates and patches. More variety was added, along with loot improvements, vastly increased vehicle view distance, and major stability improvements. Of what has been added, this is only the tip of the dune, and there is so much more to come. With the Base Reconstruction Tool and Server Transfers coming soon, and Chapter 3 on the horizon, now is an auspicious time to don the stillsuit and follow in the footsteps of the Fremen, into the vast world of Dune. Seek the spice, Sleepers ",1763661725,

1172710,New Patch Now Live! ,"Greetings Sleepers, Our latest patch is live, bringing you a list of improvements and fixes. Sit back, switch off your personal shield for a moment of peace, and peruse the highlights of today’s patch. You can also read the full patch notes here. Carry Vehicles Across Maps We have added the ability for transport ornithopters to carry vehicles between maps. This should save some time for those spice runs! New Communinet Channel A new Communinet channel has appeared, bringing sounds from another thread in time, yet the same space: it’s the full Dune: Spice Wars soundtrack! Griefing Mitigation We have put several griefing mitigation methods in place, including updated ornithopter collision; Ornithopters taking off are no longer slowed down by collisions from harassing Ornithopters above them. Also fixed an issue that made it possible for players to block interactions with some NPCs. Fixed Deep Desert Testing Station PvP/PvE Designations Some of the Deep Desert Testing Stations were incorrectly displaying whether it was a PvP or PvE area. Testing Stations in the northern part of the Deep Desert now correctly display PvP and ones in the southern part PvE. Many More Bug Fixes, Improvements, and Tweaks You can view the full list of additional changes and fixes in the full patch notes. Coming Soon: Base Reconstruction Tool and Server Transfers We're currently working on adding two much-requested features: the Base Reconstruction Tool and Character Server Transfers. The Base Reconstruction Tool lets you safely store your entire base and all its contents, so you can take a break from the game without losing any of your progress. Character Server Transfers will allow you to move your character to another World entirely. Combined with the Base Reconstruction Tool, you'll be able to bring everything with you when you move. We have also seen your feedback about imbalanced server populations, and have plans for improving this, too. We will share more about it as work progresses. Thank you all for your continued support! Your feedback is as precious as spice to us. Keep an eye out for more news on future content. Seek the shade, Sleepers ",1763458461,
1172710,Base Reconstruction Tool – Feature Blog,"Update 2025-11-14: Following some great feedback from players in the Public Test Client, we are giving the Base Reconstruction Tool a bit more time to cook. That means it won’t be available in the next update, but it will arrive in another update within the next few weeks. Greetings Sleepers, Our next patch (1.2.20.0) is expected to drop next week, and as you may know, it will include a major new feature that we’re excited to talk about: The Base Reconstruction Tool.  The patch will also include a number of other improvements, including a new communinet channel, updated balancing, and quality of life additions like griefing mitigation. We know many of you have questions, so today, we’d like to go through the Base Reconstruction Tool in more detail. Base Reconstruction Tool Return to Arrakis with ease Right now, the difficulties that come with losing your base after taking a break from the game are too harsh. Feeling obligated to log in to keep your base powered just to keep your progress is something we want to avoid. The reason bases deteriorate is that it’s not sustainable for unused bases to remain forever after they have been built, as it will needlessly occupy that area and prevent other players from building there. So, with the Base Reconstruction Tool, our goal is to greatly ease your return to Arrakis, and make your progress feel less precarious. Storing your base Once you’ve crafted the Base Reconstruction Tool, aim it at your base and click to store your base within the tool. This will immediately remove your entire base from the world. In other words, you must plan when you want to take a break. Doing this will trigger a cooldown period (to avoid circumventing base upkeep costs). The Base Reconstruction Tool will store everything within your base, including the sub-fief console, all decorations, storage containers - including water cisterns and blood purifiers - and their contents, and crafting benches. However, anything not placed directly on/in your base will not be stored, such as a light or storage container placed on natural rock. You’ll get a prompt stating how many placeables are being left behind before you confirm. Please keep in mind that vehicles are not backed up together with the base, as they are handled by a separate tool, the Vehicle Backup Tool. You can only back up one vehicle within the Vehicle Backup Tool, so for any remaining vehicles, we recommend disassembling them and storing the parts in your bank or base storage if you’re bringing that with you. Placing your base When you place your base, it’s not like placing a blueprint. It will spawn your entire physical base directly, including all its contents. Where you can place your base depends on its complexity. If it’s a simple base, you may be able to place it on any flat surface, or whatever fits. However, if your base is very complex and has many attachment points, you may only be able to place it in the exact same spot as it was originally built. Consider cliff bases with various support pillars and the like. For this reason, we have added the function to “snap to origin” while you are placing your base. If, when you return, this particular spot has been claimed by another player, don’t worry – you can transfer your character to another Sietch where hopefully, your spot will be free. Patch 1.2.20.0 The patch with the Base Reconstruction Tool is expected to arrive next week. As mentioned above, we’re also bringing a variety of other improvements and fixes. Here are a few highlights: We’ve added a new radio station to the communinet, which plays the Dune: Spice Wars soundtrack. Transport ornithopters can now travel between maps while carrying a vehicle. All Testing Stations are now properly set to either PvP if they are located in the northern part of Deep Desert, or PvE if located in the southern part. Improved ornithopter collision handling to mitigate griefing behavior. Fixed an issue that made it possible for players to block interactions with some NPCs. Many bug fixes and UI improvements. We can’t wait to release this patch. A big thanks goes out to everyone who keep giving us constructive feedback as we work to both expand and improve Arrakis, and make it the place to bring your Dune fantasy to life. A Note on Character Server Transfers & Server Merges For beyond patch 1.2.20, we’re working on adding Character Server Transfers, letting you move your character to another World entirely. With the new Base Reconstruction Tool, that means you can also bring your base and all its contents with you.  After that, we’re planning to perform server merges as well, which we know have been highly requested. We’ll provide all the necessary information about that process when we can. Seek the shade, Sleepers ",1762874630,

A: The Base Backup Tool will store everything in your base including sub-fief consoles, decorations, storage containers as well as blood purifiers and water cisterns (and their contents), and crafting benches. However, anything not placed directly on/in your base will not be stored, such as a light or storage container placed on natural rock. Additionally, vehicles are not backed up; we recommend disassembling them and storing the parts in your bank or base storage if you’re bringing that with you. Q: Can we pocket a base and move it to the Deep Desert and then back to Hagga Basin? A: Bases can only be backed up in the Hagga Basin and then only re-built in the map they were backed up in.Q: Will we be able to backup 2 bases, or only 1?

1172710,Public Test Client: Patch 1.2.20.0,"Welcome to the 1.2.20.0 Public Test Client Patch, Sleepers! We have a major feature we’re excited to test in this update: the Base Backup Tool. This is the base equivalent of the recently added Vehicle Backup Tool. More on this below. Along with this we have a number of bug fixes, UI improvements, and more. Learn more about our Public Test Clients and how they work here. Highlights BASE BACKUP TOOL - We have heard your feedback on being able to take a break from the game without losing your hard-earned progress and bases. As of 1.2.20, we are introducing the Base Backup Tool (name is subject to change), which allows you to fully back up your entire base in Hagga Basin and restore it in the same map, in any Sietch. For more information, see the detailed description below.We’ve added a new radio station to the communinet, which plays the Dune: Spice Wars soundtrack. Transport ornithopters can now travel between maps while carrying a vehicle. All Testing Stations are now properly set to either PvP if they are located in the northern part of Deep Desert, or PvE if located in the southern part. Improved Ornithopter collision handling to reduce griefing. Ornithopters taking off are no longer slowed down by collisions from harassing Ornithopters above them.Fixed an issue that made it possible for players to block interactions with some NPCs. Many bug fixes and UI improvements.  Read the full patch notes here. The best place to discuss the PTC is the relevant Steam Discussion Board and our PTC Discussion channel on Discord. May you find water along your path, Sleepers. ",1762247611,
1172710,Developer Update – October 2025,"It’s time for another look at what’s happening across the sands. The last time we talked about the future, we outlined several highly requested community features. Some of these features, such as the vehicle recovery system and the instanced Deep Desert loot, have already been implemented in the game. As always, we aim to share progress with you regularly. But, before we begin, we want to remind you that plans can change as we respond to player feedback and reassess development priorities. This flexibility is essential for ensuring the game evolves in the right direction. Now, let’s get into the details.  Cargo Containers One of the short-term improvements mentioned in our previous update was the cargo container for Carrier Ornithopters. The upcoming patch will enable the ability to travel between maps with harnessed vehicles, and we are excited to add the cargo container shortly after in our December update!  Player Event Log Another change we want to update everyone on is the improved player logging system. Some of these enhancements were introduced with Chapter 2, and we plan to start rolling out more starting with Chapter 3. Our long-term goal is to expand the player log to record all meaningful in-game events, such as item withdrawals and deposits, resource refinement, building tool actions, etc. We’re also exploring ways to categorize logs more clearly to help you find relevant information faster and reduce the chance of missing key activity. Let us know about any specific events you’d like to see added to the logging system.  Game Balance A different area we want to touch upon is game balance. Tuning skills, weapons, abilities, etc. is an ongoing process, informed by in-game data and your feedback. Some changes can be implemented quickly through smaller updates, while others—like the upcoming Rapier rework—require more time to get right. Regardless of scope, every adjustment is made with our broader design philosophies in mind. For instance, we aim to provide players with meaningful ways to disengage from combat encounters. This principle guided our recent tweaks to Crippling Strike: it’s now less punishing for those on the receiving end, with reduced stamina dash costs and increased dash distance, allowing for smarter, more dynamic escapes while maintaining tension and fairness in fights. We encourage you to continue providing feedback on Discord, Reddit, and Steam by engaging in discussions with fellow sleepers about the things you enjoy and sharing any pain points that affect your gameplay.   Character Transfers and Server Merges We’ve also seen questions about character transfers and server merges, so here’s where we are at. Character transfers are well underway, and if testing goes smoothly, they will be ready within the next few weeks. This feature will allow you to move your character, along with all your progress, inventory, and anything stored in your bank or backup tools, to a World and Sietch of your choice. To make those moves easier, we will also introduce what we internally call a Base Backup Tool. This new tool lets you store your entire base, along with nearly all its contents, as an item in your character’s inventory. Whether you’re preparing to relocate or taking a break, the tool ensures that your hard work can either move to your new home or be safely stored until you return to discover new game content. You will be able to test it out on the Public Test Client next week and we’ll share details on how it works before the feature goes live, so that you can make the most of it. As for server merges, they’ll follow soon after and by the end of this year, we’ll outline all the necessary information about this process. Several weeks will pass from that moment until the merging process begins, so that everyone has enough time to prepare. Stay tuned!  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 is the next major content update planned for Q1 2026. At its core, the goal for the next chapter is to enrich the endgame experience. The team is making excellent progress transforming the Landsraad into a contract-based system that offers repeatable PVE activities, expanding the character progression with specializations, crafting the next chapter in the main storyline, and much, much more. We can't wait to share more details about it very soon! As mentioned in our previous development update, once these changes go live, we will start transitioning the Deep Desert back to its intended purpose as a sandbox area where players can compete for control of spice.  In the meantime, development continues across all fronts, including bug fixes, ongoing balance updates, and quality-of-life improvements based heavily on your feedback, such as the in-game vendor with past Twitch Drops that's arriving in the November update!Please continue to discuss the game and ask questions on Discord, Reddit, and social channels. We monitor all these platforms, and your input continues to shape the world of Arrakis.Thank you for your passion and...",1761919247,

1172710,New Patch Now Live with Vehicle Recovery System and More!,"Greetings Sleepers, A new patch has just gone live, introducing the vehicle recovery system! Today’s patch also brings a number of significant improvements, including to the Deep Desert looting experience. Your feedback and support continue to motivate the team as they work on shaping Arrakis and improving your time there. Take a look at the highlights of today’s patch below, and check out the full patch notes here.  Vehicle Recovery System Your vehicle backup tool now has a new function – Recovery Mode. With this, you can restore any destroyed vehicle at the cost of Solari and the maximum durability of that vehicle. Items stored in the vehicle’s inventory cannot be recovered. Keep in mind that destroyed vehicles are only recoverable for a limited time (currently 72 hours). Whether it was the victim of a sandstorm, sandworm, or anything else, any vehicle can be restored. Please note that only vehicles lost after today's patch will be recoverable.  Replace Building Pieces Directly The construction tool now features a ‘Replace' mode that can be used to replace building pieces with other compatible pieces. This allows you to quickly upgrade your bases to new sets.   Vehicle View Distance The view distance of vehicles has been drastically increased (2 km) across all of Arrakis.  Instanced Deep Desert Loot Loot in PvP areas is now instanced, bringing it in alignment with other areas in the game. Every player will now get their own personal loot in the PvP areas of the Deep Desert. This ensures that you will always be rewarded for successfully clearing an area with loot chests. PvP loot has been rebalanced to fit this new experience. The loot in PvP areas still has increased drops compared to PvE areas.  Deep Desert Loot Distribution We have implemented a new loot structure for schematics in the Deep Desert. Schematics are no longer ever off rotation, meaning they can all be acquired at any time. Schematics are still tied to a certain location like a Testing Station or shipwreck (higher drops in PvP areas). The result is that for a single shipwreck for example, the loot pool is far larger, but individually, the schematics have a lower drop chance. The goal of this is to make all areas in the Deep Desert more consistently rewarding to explore and loot, while also making some rarer items somewhat more available. Massively Increased Bank Storage The banks of Arrakis have been patched to store far more. The previous restrictions were too harsh, and there were not enough ways to safeguard your hard-earned resources. Bank slots have increased from 25 to 500.  Bank inventory volume has increased from 1500 to 30000.  Research Menu Search The research menu has been patched with a search feature.  Dune Man Building Pieces (only Lost Harvest DLC owners) 17 new Dune Man Building pieces have been added to the Lost Harvest DLC. This applies to both existing and future owners of the DLC. The garage door now fits the treadwheel when it’s open.  The List Goes On These are only a few of the main highlights.

The Lost Harvest DLC has a variety of content, with the focus being on the new side story and the Treadwheel, but the way the Dune Man building pieces were communicated created expectations that it would be a full building set rather than what was our intention: four new pieces to supplement the base game building sets.We understand the disappointment some of you have shared, and to rectify that, we will work on creating more Dune Man building pieces that we’ll make available to all owners of the Lost Harvest DLC. We’re looking at adding around 15 more pieces and we aim to have these available late September or early October.Some of you were asking if we were planning on releasing additional Dune Man building pieces via Twitch Drops. No, that was never the plan. Those campaigns have their own exclusive rewards.While we’re on the topic of Twitch Drops, we can also share that we plan to make all (including past) Twitch Drops obtainable in the game and we’ll provide more details about that when ready. As with many other games, Twitch Drops are important for us to support the creator ecosystem and give the game more visibility on the Twitch platform. But, while these are free rewards available to everyone, we understand not everyone wants to or have the time to watch live streams and we want to make sure those people also get access to these items in-game sometime after the Twitch Drops campaign concludes.Once again, thank you for spending time with Chapter 2 and the Lost Harvest DLC, and please keep sharing your thoughts with us. We’ll keep you updated on all the above.",1757528844,['patchnotes']

Fashion the flesh to suit your whim. New Hairstyles & Tattoos New trends from across the Imperium eventually find their way even to Arrakis. Explore four new hairstyles and five new tattoos.

The entire Hagga Basin is free to explore, with all its varied biomes. Advance through the story, build a base, a vehicle, and explore the vast deserts. In almost every respect, the Free Trial gives you access to everything the full game has to offer. But be warned - once one tastes the spice, and the blue Eyes of Ibad start to take hold, one becomes bound to Arrakis forever. Get the full details on the Free Trial here. In-Game Event Changes are coming to Arrakis earlier than you may think! Before Chapter 2 arrives, you will experience a new conflict that leads into the major update.

1172710,Developer Update – Roadmap and Future Plans,"Hi everybody, It’s been a while since we put out our last letter and people have been chomping at the bit to hear more about our plans for the future. I apologize if people feel the communication around issues with the game has been lacking; we are focused on improving this. With a percentage of the team having their well earned (and state mandated) vacations, customer service and the community team have not always had access to developers who can answer their every question. We’ve been playing whack-a-mole with bugs, cheats and exploits during the July month of summer. We’ve banned thousands of cheaters, fixed a bunch of duplication and exploit bugs and continued working on the stability of the game. We’ve been working to achieve a cadence of patches that allows us time to make stable and consistent fixes, while being fast enough to address issues like exploits before they get too far out of control. Live Game development is a blend of reactivity and long term planning. This week, at Gamescom, we are going to be talking about the Chapter 2 Free Update and The Lost Harvest DLC, our first major additions to the game, which will be releasing in parallel. Some of you will note that while Chapter 2 and the DLC add new content and cosmetics to the game, they are not focused on the endgame. This is because Chapter 2 and the DLC were planned and began development before launch. Take a look at our Roadmap below. You can see both the free updates and paid DLCs planned for the near future, and our monthly development cycle as it pertains to player feedback, bugs, and cheats. This monthly cadence is not necessarily always achieved, but it serves to give a window into our approach.  We will share more about the major content and features coming in Chapter 2 and the DLC soon, but in terms of quality of life improvements, we’re adding the ability to rename vehicles, storage containers, and other placeables; more reliable ornithopter rockets for combat enthusiasts; and the highly requested option to swap seats in a vehicle with a hotkey. All of these features will be available for testing on the Public Test Client soon! So let’s talk about the endgame. During summer we’ve made changes and tweaks to the formula of the Deep Desert – with varying degrees of success. We have attracted very different demographics to the game and they are asking for very different things. We’ve identified several core issues; loss of items/vehicles, players feeling that they are forced into PvP, exploits and cheats, and lack of endgame content/grind. There are things that we can do in the short term to address some of these, and things that will take us longer to improve. Short-term, we will be making changes that are heavily requested by players. Here are some that are coming quickly: Improved Player Logging – One of the key frustrations we see is the lack of information and clarity around why certain items/objects/vehicles are gone. We will increase the information in your logs so that you have a better idea of what is going on. For example, listing the names of people who take things from chests in your base. Vehicle Salvaging System – We’re working on a vehicle salvaging system that will allow you to recover lost vehicles. Cobalt Paste/Vehicle Inventory – We’re adjusting the volume of the infamous cobalt paste and adding more slots to the Assault Ornithopter vehicle inventory. We will be adding a cargo container that can be carried by the Carrier Ornithopter. Instanced Deep Desert Loot – The constant camping and queuing of the Deep Desert Testing Stations leads to a frustrating experience where people arrive at an empty Testing Station. We’re going to change these to be more in line with the rest of the game. Offline Notifications about important events – We understand that not everybody can or wants to log in to check power/taxes constantly in the game. We would like to create a notification service that sends you the status of your base via email. This one is squarely aimed at you, Ben. These are in addition to the current slate of UI/UX improvements, continued crackdown on exploiters/cheaters, and stability improvements. Now let’s talk about longer term planning and what we have in store for the endgame. As we’ve mentioned previously, the Landsraad is supposed to be the endgame activity driver. Currently it does not have the breadth or depth of content or progression to serve that function. As we work towards Chapter 3, we will begin to tie the faction progression of the game to the Landsraad, while also systematically building out the Landsraad with a greater variety of activities across the world. As a player this means that you can increase your faction rank by completing Landsraad tasks, checking in with your Duke or Baron occasionally to perform special missions and visit faction vendors. Landsraad activities will become contract based, rather than delivery based, which will allow us to effectively remove the issue of stockpiling th...",1755534394,

In the meantime, we will continue to take action on accounts you reported via the Request Help option in the game.  Last but not least, we are temporarily disabling Family Sharing as part of our efforts as we have unfortunately seen this feature abused frequently. We apologize to our players who legitimately used this feature. We are actively working on changes that will allow us to re-enable the system as soon as possible. While we don’t have an ETA to share at the moment, we are aiming to implement those changes within this year. We will let you know as soon as we have a date.  Thank you all for your reports, cooperation, and your continued patience and understanding. ",1753461581,

1172710,Developer Update,"Hello Sleepers, This letter begins with an apology. On Monday the 7th of July, we patched out a layout change to the Deep Desert which caused several areas of the PvE Deep Desert to become PvP enabled. This was an oversight in our development process and internal communications, which led to people suffering an unfortunate amount of lost bases and equipment. This change was intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle. We’re incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We’ve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future. We are working to reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this. You can expect the reimbursed materials, items, and vehicle components to show up in the in-game 'Claim Rewards' tab by the end of this week.  Moving Forward As we approach the end of the launch phase, we wanted to take a moment to discuss some of the other issues that are happening in the game. Our primary focus, which continues over the next weeks and months, will be to remove all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics). In addition, we will be hard at work improving the game, adding quality of life features, and addressing critical gameplay issues.   We have zero tolerance for the type of player behaviour that has an impact on the experience of other players, and we will continue to focus on ensuring that players can enjoy the game as it is intended. If you see someone cheating or exploiting, please report them to us using the available channels.We’ve taken action on several hundred players who have abused exploits, cheats and hacks, and there will be more waves of bans coming as we identify further culprits. In addition, we have fixed the following exploits thus far: Account/Permission spoofing Building Dismantle Item Duplication Increased Damage/Insta Kill attacks Vehicle Inventory/VBT Item Duplication Vehicle Ownership takeover Projectile weapon rapid fire (rockets from ornithopters) Durability Repair We have a team dedicated exclusively to fighting hackers and fixing exploits. Over the next few patches, they will be introducing additional efforts to prevent exploits by increasing security on several client/server communication layer, performing additional penetration testing against common attack vectors, and auditing our item and inventory systems to make sure they are resistant to item duplication.  Item & Vehicle Loss We apologize to people who have lost vehicles or other resources due to various bugs in the game. These events can be rather thorny to untangle because there is legitimate item loss due to game mechanics, which makes it difficult to identify item loss due to bugs. At launch we lacked the tooling and logging to identify and reimburse all circumstances of item loss. But we have been working on improving our tools so that we can better reimburse players for vehicle losses due to bugs. There is a backlog of customer support requests, so we beg your patience when waiting for tickets to be resolved. Our aim is to resolve support tickets as quickly as we can, including tickets that were closed near launch when we weren’t able to properly reimburse players. If you have lost a vehicle to a bug and require assistance, please submit a ticket in game and include vehicle type, tier, and when/how you lost the vehicle. The development team has been also working to address the root causes of the item loss in game. We have a dedicated team focused on mitigating vehicle/item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps. To our players, we appreciate you and your continued support. We have a lot of exciting things planned for Dune: Awakening and, despite a few bumps in the road, we’re really excited for what the future holds. We hope you are as well! Sincerely Joel, Vlad, Scott, Ole and the Funcom team  ",1752046171,

1172710,The Deep Desert Hotfix is Live!,"Greetings Sleepers, A new hotfix went live today, bringing changes to the Deep Desert, ornithopters, visiting other Sietches, and more! The full patch notes have already been released, but we’d like to highlight some of the changes here. If the download for the hotfix hasn’t appeared for you, please restart your Steam client. Deep Desert PvE-PvP Balance As discussed in detail in the message from our Creative Director, this is the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert. As of right now, the PvE area has been expanded to include the southern half of the Deep Desert map. Pockets of PvP will remain within the new PvE zone for Control Points and Shipwrecks. With this change, we have also rebalanced resources in the Deep Desert somewhat, with density increasing the further north you go, including spice. Loot is overall more valuable and plentiful in the northmost PvP zones. Having said that, it’s important to note that the highest tier of resources are still available in the bottom half of the Deep Desert. We will continue monitoring how this plays out and continue iterating when and if needed. Ornithopters Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module now decreases the top speed of Scout Ornithopters by 20% and 10% for Assault Ornithopters. We have more changes planned but this is in line with the goal of encouraging meaningful decisions about how you outfit your vehicles and choosing whether you want to be aggressive or not in PvP zones. Visiting Other Sietches We have removed restrictions when visiting other sietches. Before, you could visit other sietches but you couldn’t claim land. Now, any player can go to any sietch in their World and claim land wherever they want (the max number of sub-fief consoles (3) remains unchanged). Additional Fixes In this hotfix, we have also brought a number of fixes and improvements addressing stability, combat, user interface, and more.   Thank you all for your continued feedback and bug reports, it’s very helpful! Check out the full patch notes to see all the changes. Seek the shade, Sleepers ",1750941927,
1172710,Dune Awakening update makes Deep Desert changes to remove PvP requirements,"A new <strong>Dune Awakening</strong> update today tackles one of the survival game's most common endgame frustrations. The new MMO has proved tremendously popular, opening up its incarnation of Arrakis to a huge number of players, but its endgame shift in direction has left some underwhelmed. While most of the core progression is PvE and doesn't require you to clash with your fellow adventurers, the endgame demands you head into the Deep Desert, consequently forcing you into Dune Awakening PvP. However, that's no longer the case, as Dune Awakening patch 1.1.0.17 delivers sweeping Deep Desert changes. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dune-awakening/update-deep-desert-changes"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dune-awakening/base-building"">Dune Awakening base building guide</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dune-awakening/down-server-status"">Is Dune Awakening down?

1172710,Dune: Awakening - 1.1.0.17 Patch Notes,"Hey Sleepers,This hotfix requires a client-side download. Remember to restart your Steam client if the download does not appear automatically for you. Servers will be coming back up shortly.For the list of known issues, please visit our Discord server or Steam discussion boards. FEATURES AND CHANGESDeep Desert:As outlined in A message from the Creative Director on PvE and PVP » Dune: Awakening, this hotfix will see the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert. Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future.The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map.This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE.Control Points and Shipwrecks will, however, continue to be PvP throughout the entire map, which means you will find localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin.To retain the Risk vs Reward setup for the Deep Desert:The density of resources increases the further north you go. This includes high-density clusters of valuable resources.The largest spice fields will also spawn in the north.The majority of Control Points will exist in the northern part.As part of these changes, we have made some balancing adjustments in the Deep Desert:The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a ""first come, first served"" basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest.Plasteel plates can only be found in PvP zones. This line was inaccurate, since Plasteel plates can be obtained from crashing ships.The amount of active medium spice fields has been reduced from 8 to 5.The number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22.The spawn rate of Titanium and Stravidium has been reduced in the PvE areas so that large quantities only spawn in the far-out PvP areas.The number of nodes in resource hotspots in the PvE part of the map has been reduced.The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has increased from 30 to 45 minutes.Some Imperial Testing Stations are still in the PvP region, and players who want all schematics available each week will want to visit both the PvP and PvE Imperial Testing Stations. Keep in mind the loot in them rotates each week, so even if you're not interested in PvP, you could obtain it at a later date if you're not able to trade for it or buy it off the Exchange.Vehicles:We have begun work on the outlined changes to the Scout Ornithopters.Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module will now decrease the top speed of your Ornithopter.For Scout Ornithopters, the reduction is 20%.For Assault Ornithopters, the reduction is 10%.Infocards for the modules now reflect this change.Exiting ornithopters mid-air will now cause them to drop straight down instead of gliding away. This should decrease the chance that you lose your ornithopter upon disconnecting from the game or exiting by accident your ornithopter mid-air (yes, we have seen the videos).Known issue: There is an edge case that if your vehicle ends up in the quicksand you might not be able to interact with it if you are in the quicksand. The workaround is to try to get on top of the vehicle to interact with it. This will be fixed in the very next patch.Visiting:We removed the restrictions when visiting other sietches.Before this change, players had their “home” sietches, and could visit other sietches in their world but couldn’t claim land. Now, any player can go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want.Players can also place respawn beacons on any sietch in their world.As a result of this change, the home icon on the server selection screen, which previously indicated your home server, now indicates on what server you have a base. Similarly, a vehicle icon shows where you have vehicles.Technical and stability:Increased game stability.The latest NVIDIA driver was added to the GPU driver check at the game launch.OtherWe have introduced Player Reporting, allowing players to now report other players' messages from the text chat.FIXESTechnical and stability:As a continuous effort, we have closed several exploit vulnerabilities.Fixed an issue where a specific type of network issue would cause players to be stuck in an infinite loading screen.Fixed an issue where some players could experience a client freeze when traveling between Deep Desert servers.Combat:Fixed an issue where players performing a melee attack could get obstructed by co...",1750925168,['patchnotes']
