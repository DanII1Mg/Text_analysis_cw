534380,Update 1.25 - Halloween Patch (1.25),"Halloween returns to Villedor with a blend of familiar scares and new surprises. This year’s event combines the open-world experience with the Tower Raid: Halloween Run format introduced last year. Over three weeks, the event will evolve with new challenges, global goals, and rewards. Halloween Showdown Halloween returns to Villedor, and this year, it’s bigger, creepier, and packed with plenty of treats! The Halloween-themed decor can be found in various parts of the City once again. Pumpkintiles and seasonal infected roam the streets, dropping Halloween Candies when defeated. This year’s Halloween event spans three weeks, each built around head-to-head faction contests that challenge players to pick a side and contribute to their faction’s success. Baka the Unfortunate once again serves as the event vendor and guide, distributing bounties, handling trades, and rewarding survivors who embrace the Halloween spirit. The event runs over three consecutive week-long competitions. Each week presents a new pair of rival factions led by themed characters: Week 1: Plague vs. Scarecrow Week 2: Van Aiden vs. Count Skull Week 3: CyberRaider vs. Cursed Pirate By completing event activities across Villedor and in the Tower Raid mode, players earn a special event currency: a new type of Halloween Candy. These candies function similarly to previous years’ event tokens, but earning them may vary between weeks: Week 1: you earn them by killing Halloween enemies across Villedor Week 2: you earn them by playing Tower Raid Week 3: you earn them by doing bounties on our Community Maps Players can exchange these candies with Baka to contribute points toward a chosen faction’s goal. Both factions work toward milestones, and once the target is reached, all participants receive themed weapons corresponding to that matchup. However, the competition continues until the end of the week, encouraging players to keep contributing for a shot at an additional reward. At the conclusion of each weekly competition, the faction that accrues the most points unlocks an exclusive character-themed charm for all players. These charms are visible in-game through the faction selection screen, allowing everyone to see the competing rewards and decide which team to support. Throughout the event, players can continue to earn candies and reputation by completing bounties, defeating seasonal enemies, exploring the City, and conquering Tower Raid’s haunted variant. Speaking of Tower Raid, this Halloween features new layout variations, random modifiers, and a specially decorated rooftop arena culminating in a boss fight unique to this event. Long-time favorites Scarecrow, Plague, Van Aiden, and Cursed Pirate (who you will be able to keep after the event ends) return as playable characters. The new competitor, CyberRaider, joins the lineup with a futuristic, high-mobility combat style. To spice things up, each week we’ll be updating weapons and some items of those characters, so each playthrough will be a little different. But that’s not all! Once the Tower’s doors open for Halloween scares, it will become permanently accessible as part of an update to the game, introducing the CyberRaider as a new playable character, alongside fresh floor layouts, rebalanced modifiers, and an expanded reward track. These additions deepen replayability while retaining the high challenge that defines the Tower Raid experience.

534380,10 Highlights That Make Dying Light: The Beast Unforgettable,"Dying Light: The Beast is almost here and we can’t wait for you to finally get your hands on it. If you’re still wondering whether to dive in, here are 10 Highlights that make Dying Light: The Beast unforgettable reasons why this game deserves your attention. 1.KYLE CRANE IS BACK!Let’s start with the big one… Kyle Crane is back! Whether you’ve followed his story since Harran or are meeting him for the first time, Dying Light: The Beast reintroduces this iconic survivor in a way that feels both familiar and brand new. After more than a decade in captivity and cruel experiments, Crane emerges scarred, altered, and carrying the weight of everything he’s lost. The world he steps into is as new and hostile to him as it will be to youGameplay reflects this evolution. Animations inspired by Dying Light 1 have been re-engineered to feel raw and unforgiving, contrasting the survival desperation of human Crane with the terrifying strength of his Beast form. Roger Craig Smith returns to deliver one of his most emotional performances yet, capturing not just rage and power, but also the exhaustion and trauma of a man who has been broken and rebuilt. And Crane’s design embodies his duality – half man, half monster. His corrupted eye, deep scars, and beastly traits are balanced with subtle details like Jade’s necklace, his old watch, and reminders of the survivor he once was.And if you need to catch up on Crane’s journey so far - don’t worry. We’ve prepared a short recap that will get you ready to step into his shoes once again.2. CASTOR WOODS – A BREATHTAKING NEW SETTINGThe game, and its story, takes place in the valley of Castor Woods, a brand-new, handcrafted location built specifically for Dying Light: The Beast. Unlike the cityscapes of previous games, this environment is more natural and varied, designed to feel both expansive and intimate at the same time. Players will move between a tourist town, historic villas, thick forests, flooded farmland, swamps, and the remnants of an industrial park, each area offering its own identity and challengesWe wanted Castor Woods to feel like a place with real history. Tourism, local traditions, and industry once shaped the region, and traces of them are still present in the world today. Mountain lodges, ranger stations, worker housing, and family homes all tell fragments of stories that players can piece together as they explore. Even though the valley has fallen into decay, it was important for us to make it visually striking - a beautiful zombie apocalypse setting where every path or ruin hides something to uncover. From small collectibles and notes to larger secrets and easter eggs, Castor Woods rewards curiosity at every step3. BRUTAL, PHYSICAL, AND UNFORGIVING COMBATCombat in Dying Light: The Beast has been rebuilt from the ground up to emphasize its physicality, brutality, and creativity. Every swing of a weapon, every punch, and every bullet is designed to feel impactful. Active ragdoll reactions, destructible body parts, and detailed wound systems make sure that what happens on screen looks and feels authentic. You’ll see enemies stagger, collapse, and break in ways that reflect the raw force behind each strike.Enemies bring a level of challenge and intensity fitting a survival game. Humans use cover, flanking, and up to 22 tactical strategies to make fights unpredictable. Zombies, on the other hand, rely on sheer aggression, determined to grab you, reacting immediately to noise, relentlessly countering each attack.To achieve the right level of realism, our team even used practical effects - like fake blood and staged splatter tests – as references for how wounds spread, how fluids react, and how surfaces stain. Unique finishers add cinematic, gory satisfaction, making combat as horrifying as it is thrilling. The result is gore that isn’t just shock value but grounded in tangible detail4. HORRORS OF THE NIGHTNight in Castor Woods is designed to bring back the scary feel of the first game, a true test of survival. Darkness is heavier, and the infected that roam it have evolved into smarter, faster, more menacing predators. Volatiles move in coordinated packs, adapting to your actions, and their new locomotion system makes them unstoppable whether you’re sprinting through the narrow streets of the tourist town or across the dense, shadowy forests of the Nature Reserve. In the final weeks before production, a major focus was placed on refining Volatile behavior and locomotion to make night encounters more intense and believable. Their locomotion system was overhauled with tighter pathfinding and an improved set of run and jump animations, allowing them to close distances with far greater efficiency. We also worked on their sensory awareness, making them quicker to detect player actions, such as the flicker of a flashlight. These changes combine to create chases that are more varied, unpredictable, and terrifying than ever. 5. PARKOUR AND TRAVERSAL: GROUNDED AND REALISTICPar...",1758117958,

534380,All about Zombies!,"One thing you can’t imagine Dying Light without is zombies. With Dying Light: The Beast, we wanted to push them further than ever - not only visually, but also in how they behave, react, and sound. They’re the backbone of the experience, and we dedicated enormous effort to making them unsettling, believable, and unforgettable ARTISTIC VISION This time our philosophy was simple: zombies should always remind you of who they were before turning. That faint trace of humanity creates hesitation in players - making every encounter more disturbing. As Charidimos Bitsakakis (Character Concept Artist) explained, to avoid lifeless, doll-like figures with glassy eyes, we pushed them deeper into the uncanny valley - human-like realism that’s hard to look at, yet impossible to ignore.Biters, the most common infected, underwent a complete redesign. Instead of resembling dried, mummified corpses, they now appear rotten and organic, their decomposing skin wet and bloated. Katarzyna Bech (Lead Character Concept Artist) describes this new aesthetic as a “degenerated human” - repulsive, yet believable.To bring variety, we created over 110 variants of Biters. You’ll encounter different body types - skinny, regular, and obese - as well as special types that introduce unique gameplay challenges, like the classic gas tank Biter, a hazard-suited nightmare. Virals are different. Since in the lore they’ve only recently turned, they retain more traces of humanity - natural skin tones, recognizable features, and the look of someone who hasn’t been gone for long… But that lingering humanity makes them even more disturbing, as we exaggerated blood patterns, their twisted expressions and raw fury blazing in their eyes. There are nearly 60 variants of Virals in the game. Early on, you’ll face Lab Virals - victims of Baron’s gruesome experiments. Their torn, decomposed skin and open wounds hint at surgical tampering. They look like a halfway step between standard Virals and Baron’s monstrous creations, foreshadowing the horrors yet to come.Following the same artistic direction for our special infected types, we reimagined them, by grounding each one in who they once were, creating a new character model for each one of them. Their backstories became crucial to their visual design, and their lingering memories influence their behavior. The Howler, for example, is a psychiatric patient still bound by restraints. The Goon is a hulking brute shaped from the body of a blue-collar worker. The Spitter, once a medical professional, now spews corrosive acid from the very chemicals he once used to heal. These archetypes root the infected in reality, making them both familiar and terrifying - and the subtle hints at their past lives reinforce the fear of becoming one of them. At the same time, we wanted clashes with them to feel just as visceral than encounters with regular zombies. That’s why, when redesigning their visuals, we focused on enabling visible, progressive body damage. Fighting a Goon is a true spectacle of gore: wounds tear open, blood splatters, and destruction spreads across its body, reinforcing that your attacks are having an impact. To achieve this effect, we doubled the number of visible wounds that can appear on any single enemy and expanded the number of damage zones - up to twelve on Biters and Virals, with even more on larger enemies.And speaking of larger enemies - the true stars of Dying Light: The Beast are the Chimeras, hulking monstrosities born from the Baron’s twisted experiments. By taking different types of special infected and pushing them beyond their limits, he created something entirely new - more powerful, unpredictable, and far more dangerous. As Katarzyna Bech explained, the challenge was to blend gameplay function with visual realism, ensuring they wouldn’t feel like “just monsters.”When designing the Chimeras, we took inspiration from human anatomy. Our artists studied medical illustrations and models to understand muscles, tissues, and overall body structure. It was one of the team’s biggest artistic challenges - and also a valuable opportunity to learn and grow.The Matriarch, one of Baron’s chimeras, perfectly embodies this vision. Inspired by everything from anatomical diagrams to raw meat, she was designed to look like a human stripped of skin, with muscles and tissues exposed. Concept Artist Marta Sokołowska explained her intent: “I wanted to create something haunting and unsettling, like a witch from nightmares.”GAMEPLAY The artistic vision only works if it carries into gameplay, so a lot of our work was focused on two key aspects: making zombies aggressive and reactive to whatever the player does. Biters are a prime example - when struck, they counter quickly with almost no cooldown, leaving little room to breathe and forcing you to think before engaging. Virals show their aggression and reactivity through more human-like behavior: they’re smarter and faster than Biters, position themselves strategicall...",1757609853,
534380,Watch: 'The Monsters' Trailer,"“They tried to break him. They created The Beast.”Free and out in the wild, you continue your quest for revenge. But the Baron still has his hooks in you; his experiments wreaking havoc, the zombie DNA clashes with yours and it seems to be winning. You’re losing control…When the Beast takes over, your strength is pushed beyond human limits: you run faster, leap further and you become even more brutal. Rip zombies apart with your bare hands, shake the ground by pounding it with your fists, and punch through zombie torsos. You’ll see it in all its glory, thanks to the immersive first-person perspective. As the Beast, your savagery knows no bounds. But you still need to take control of it.For that, you need something from the Chimeras. Just like you, they’ve mutated after being experimented on by the Baron. Taking these grotesque, hulking monsters down won’t be easy, but the reward will be worth it. Killing them and injecting their blood won’t just give you more control over the Beast: you’ll become more powerful and be able to unleash even more carnage. But these devastating beastly powers won’t be enough once the night comes.That’s because once the sun sets, the true horrors come out. The beauty of Castor Woods is quickly enveloped in darkness, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere. You suddenly go from being the hunter to the hunted. Unpredictable and frightening, before you know it, your shallow, panicked breathing begins to match Kyle’s. The unknown that the night brings adds to the nerve-wrecking tension and the horror. You’ll begin to question if something’s lurking in the shadows, or if it's just your mind playing tricks on you. And if that wasn’t enough, the Volatiles are back and searching for their next terrified prey.Whether alone or in packs, the series’ apex predators will hunt you down. You may not see them, but they’re there… stalking you from the cover of darkness. Fast, agile and strong as hell, they’re tough to kill. Their improved senses will notice you more easily now; something as simple as the flicker of a flashlight can set them upon you. And once you’re in their sights, the chase is on. Even if you decide to fight back, they’re not ones to retreat. They’ll fight you til the last drop of blood!Even for the Beast, there’s plenty more monsters out there in Castor Woods.

534380,"Beauty by Day, Horror by Night","Since the beginning of Dying Light, our goal has been to create the most immersive zombie apocalypse. Through our work on the series, we’ve learned that achieving this requires mastering three key areas: visuals, sound design, and gameplay mechanics. Let’s explore immersion and horror in Dying Light: The Beast!Nights, Now Even Scarier Visual details and the advanced graphical engine make exploration a real treat during the day, but for a game like Dying Light what counts most is how atmospheric the night is. After all, this is where our “open world meets survival horror” formula shines best: using in-game systems to create challenges and frights for players. Our goal for Dying Light: The Beast was to create a tense, terrifying night experience with a heavy, nerve-wrecking tension that could rival the legendary after-hours moments of the first Dying Light. We assembled a dedicated strike team of programmers, game designers, and level designers, iterating weekly, and continuing their work throughout the game’s entire production. Some weeks were focused on Volatile behavior, others on spawning rules and chase mechanics. The result is a night system that will, hopefully, feel unpredictable and frightening, resulting in an experience you will remember for a long time.We have pulled a lot of levers to achieve the horror and scary feeling we wanted for the night. We made them darker in general, but what we also discovered is that the Castor Woods setting helped us a lot conveying the atmosphere we were looking for and adding different shades to it. After all, it is a different experience when you wander around the forest of the Nature Reserve (super dark!) compared to trying to sneak past Volatiles inside the city (where burning barrels create a different vibe). Another important decision was to refocus the night experience strictly on Volatiles, our apex predators - and this has driven all of the choices we have taken along the way. We redesigned how Volatiles move, both alone and in coordinated packs, so they could hunt players more effectively across all areas of the map. We iterated on our spawning technology to make you feel their presence, no matter where they are. On top of that, we also had to tweak the experience with our vehicle in mind, as well as account for the diversity of the map, which features many different areas, from narrow streets to open fields. So, the nights were made darker, the flashlight gained a more physical feel with visible inertia, and the Volatiles became smarter. But we heard from you that it still might not be enough. That’s why, in the final weeks of production, we formed a strike team of AI and gameplay programmers, supported by our Tech & Art teams, to make nights even more terrifying. We’ve been incorporating feedback gathered during gamescom and from the reactions to influencers playing our build. You want more of that nail-biting night terror? We have more!Here’s just a short list of some of elements we have worked on in these last few weeks leading to the release:Significant improvements in locomotion of Volatiles increasing effectiveness of chasesTighter path finding algorithms reducing unnecessary path selectionsImproved run loop animationAdditional jump grabs and jump attacksReduced synchronicity of animations (e.g. UV reaction), adding more variety to Volatile encountersVolatile senses - making it easier for them to notice the player and react to his behaviors (e.g. flashlight flashing)Conditions for retreat behaviors, making them fight till the last drop of blood in a bigger number of casesMore realistic logic of spawnersConditions of Volatiles jumping on a car from the front and from the backPhysics of Volatile jumpsOn top of that, we've also worked on the visuals of Volatiles making them more bloody and increasing the number of their variants, making each one of them scarier and more unique.Immersive Sounds Another element that adds to the scariness of the night is the sound design. Because we want you to feel like you’re “truly there”, our main focus was the ambiance of the night - we made it subtle so you can hear the footsteps of the Volatiles and the Infected well and locate them precisely among your surroundings, being able to understand their distance just from hearing alone. But once you’re spotted, everything changes - first, you hear the characteristic scary sound, and then music kicks in, full of tension and highlighted by Kyle’s breathing heavily. But when you finally manage to escape the chase and find a Safe Zone that will offer you shelter until the sun rises, you can also discover another side of Castor Woods. What’s scary during the night can actually look and sound beautiful during the day. Each biome - from the town, through the swamp, to the dense forest - has its own unique, highly detailed soundscape. In the city, you hear cracking windows and antennas; in the forest, snapping branches; in the swamps, the splash of water and other subtle natural...",1757340103,
534380,Behind the Beast - Parkour and Combat,"Since the beginning of Dying Light, our goal has been to immerse players in the zombie apocalypse. In Dying Light: The Beast, we pushed parkour and combat to the next level. Parkour feels grounded with natural, weighty body movement and carefully balanced jump physics that eliminate floatiness. Players can climb anywhere without stamina limits, but must use observation to reach tricky spots. There are no parkour assists in default mode, keeping the challenge realistic, while the environment of Castor Woods allows for seamless flow and exploration. Kyle now has 17 unique edge grab animations and over 100 new animations that show his agility and skill at every step. Combat - physical, brutal & creative - is based on a new physics engine that delivers realistic hit reactions and precise impact on enemy bodies. Swing and stop animations have been improved to make every hit feel powerful, while active ragdoll and short animations create fluid, responsive reactions. Human enemies support stealth playstyle and use advanced cover mechanics during shootouts with up to 22 different positioning strategies. The damage model lets players destroy over a dozen body parts with more visible and varied wounds than before, making every encounter intense and rewarding. But that's not all!

534380,Watch: 'Out in the Wild' Trailer,"“They tried to break him. They created The Beast.”Tortured for years, you’re finally out in the wild. You are free and seeking revenge, but you may have just traded one hell for another. Welcome to the beautiful zombie apocalypse. Welcome to Castor Woods. Here the hand-crafted open world meets nail-biting survival horror as you explore the region, uncovering tales, horrors and mysteries that lie beneath the surface. Rain or shine, take in your surroundings traversing the dense forests, historic tourist town, swamps, farmfields and hiking trails high in the national park. There are stories of survival at every corner of this stunning valley. The region is brought to life with high fidelity graphics fully utilizing technical advancements, like the heavily reworked lighting system that includes dynamic sky and sun movement. Dynamic weather pushes the immersion to the next level that not only changes the visuals, but also impacts gameplay. In fact, it’s so immersive even the zombies can’t help but gaze at the sun when it sets. This world doesn’t just feel lived in, it feels alive. Even if most of its inhabitants are dead. To see the next sunrise here, you need to move. Feel the rush of the best-in-class representation of first-person perspective parkour: leap between rooftops, scale buildings and dash through enemy fire. Use everything in your parkour moveset to outrun and outmaneuver whatever’s chasing you. This is grounded and immersive. This is physical and realistic. This is what the edge of your seat was made for.And if that’s not enough, grab one of the 4x4s left around the valley and put the pedal to the metal! Roam across the terrain to get where you want even quicker, or use it as Dying Light: The Beast’s heaviest weapon and mow down anything that stands in your way. But don’t forget: this is a survival game and just like you, a vehicle is not indestructible. There’s no greater dread than realising you're down to fuel fumes in the middle of the forest, surrounded by shrieks of Volatiles leaving their hives to hunt for the night.Even for Kyle Crane, survival is tough out in the wild. But you push to see the next day on your quest for revenge. You’ll get that bastard, the Baron, no matter the cost. Yet, something inside feels wrong.

534380,Update 1.24 — Stamina Patch (1.24),"The upcoming patch prioritizes game health, focusing on critical improvements rather than introducing a multitude of new features. Our aim is to enhance overall performance, stability, and player experience, ensuring a smoother and more reliable gameplay environment. Unlimited ParkourIn this update, we are refining the stamina system to enhance the core gameplay experience, particularly focusing on combat and evasion dynamics. Players will now find that parkour actions no longer deplete stamina, allowing for seamless disengagement from melee combat, even when stamina reserves are low (the only exceptions are the Dash and Dart parkour skills). This change will make navigation more fluid and enjoyable, positioning stamina primarily as a combat resource. You’ll now have the full freedom to explore Villedor the very moment you enter the city! However, to maintain alignment with the existing mission progression, stamina will still be required for parkour activities from the ""Pilgrim's Path"" quest — after the player is bitten by a Volatile — until an inhibitor is used near the end of ""Markers of Plague"". Additionally, stamina will continue to be a crucial resource for combat, underwater swimming, and using the paraglider. This update seeks to balance exploration and combat, ensuring that players can navigate the environment smoothly while managing their stamina during critical gameplay moments.Game UpdatesOn top of all the Update 1.24 additions listed above, we’ve introduced the following fixes and improvements: Co-OpFixed an unclear message that appeared on screen after being kicked by the host Tower RaidFixed the issue where the “Lower Body Workout” bounty would count kicks on dead enemiesFixed the issue with the DIY Grenade displaying the wrong item nameFixed Sola’s 25th reward that showed the wrong item nameFixed an issue where Breach’s starting weapon used a tip mod of a different rarity than shown on the blueprintFixed the issue with the Craft Parts Bundle item using the chest iconFixed the issues with skin clipping through the Bad Office Day Outfit GameplayFlashlight rework during the main quest cutscenes and dialoguesRevised select dialogues and scenes for a more streamlined storyFixed an issue where the co-op menu displayed the incorrect online status for friendsFixed the inconsistency with stamina regeneration when set to Tactical modeFixed the issue with polearm animation in the menuUpdated the “Immunity drain” text to read, “Immunity drain when being hit by an enemy”Fixed the issue where the hatch in “The Only Way Out” quest sometimes wouldn’t open TechnicalFixed the issue causing the player to fall under the map upon arriving at the Carnage HallFixed the issue with the Fire Brigade Cap Charm not being visible after attaching it to weaponsFixed the issue with charms changing sizeFixed the issue with player’s inventory slots being blocked by certain non-droppable items of unique rarityFixed various crashesFixed visible clipping on the paraglider backpack from the Friend of Aiden BundleFixed the Terminal Headache trophy not registering when using firearms",1755598283,

534380,Blood & Guts,"We are offering a glimpse into the increased gore and brutality levels of Dying Light: The Beast in a new trailer titled “Blood & Guts”. And if the title doesn't give it away, consider this a definitive warning: The video contains extremely brutal and graphic violence - watch it at your own risk! From the first frame to the last, it delivers a non-stop montage of the most brutal moments of Dying Light: The Beast - including decapitations, bone-shattering slashes, blood-quenching stabs and cool finishers.Ambition for the most brutal Dying Light yet Dying Light has always been a franchise in which horror and primal brutality go hand in hand but Dying Light: The Beast elevates it to a new level. “We’ve dramatically increased the body horror to give you this feeling of fighting for pure survival and Kyle’s hunger for revenge,” says Tymon Smektała, Dying Light Franchise Director. And it’s not just for show - the gore adds a lot of interactive storytelling and to the psychological horror as well: “It's one thing to see a health bar go down; it's another entirely to see the flesh peel away from bone or have a burnt and destroyed faces only inches away from you - that’s how nightmares are made!” The level of brutality is driven by significant tech improvements to our in-house engine.“We’ve overhauled the body damage system,” explains Nathan Lemaire, Game Director. “We doubled the number of places on enemies - we call them Gore-Nodes - where players can inflict damage and the number of wounds or injuries that are visible on one single enemy. And we improved the precision of melee attacks - so the angle and trajectory of your strike defines what you hit and how your enemies react to it. So you can target and cut off limbs more precisely than ever!”The combinations of wounds, mutilations and damage is almost endless, making every fight in Dying Light: The Beast a raw spectacle of blood and gore. And while every combat will feel gory, the brutal finishers take it to the top, with nearly triple the number of finishers! Techland takes blood & guts seriousTo have a realistic representation of gore in Dying Light: The Beast, the art team went to some lengths. “We’ve improved all of the visuals of wounds and injuries and match them with all of the body types. The research was extensive - I just hope no one ever looks up my browser history,” says Dominik Wasieńko, Lead Character Artist.A recent video showcased Techland's efforts to create more realistic blood for Dying Light: The Beast. Katarzyna Tarnacka-Polito adds: “Nothing out there provided us with the reality in blood splatter that we were looking for. So we bought a lot of fake blood and recreated what we needed in real-life with an actor.” With 7 more weeks till launch, Techland is now even improving and adding a few more details to make it as brutal as possible.

Praised as the “Hero of Harran” and a man who sacrificed himself to the point of infection, you became target no. 1 for the Baron’s brutal, beastly experiments. After being used as a human guinea pig for more than a decade and having your DNA spliced with zombie strains, you break out.But you are not free. Now, an internal conflict begins as the virus takes over: it’s man vs. monster. You want more than anything to return to the old you, but he’s all but gone. However, you can still find the strength to make sure your human DNA remains dominant. And while these primal beast-like abilities may be seen as a curse, they may just give you the upper hand in your quest for revenge and, ultimately, rip the man who did this to you apart. One. Limb. At. A. Time.And to do that, you’re going to need some help and this just might be the way to bring the old Crane back: the citizens of Castor Woods are in dire need of a savior and you’re their only hope.

Only if you can take control of it.A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE HAS NEVER LOOKED THIS BEAUTIFULCastor Woods, a place of beauty and a once idyllic location to visit. That was until the outbreak.

Just remember: you might not like what you find. Is there anything more eerily beautiful?But Castor Woods is more than just natural beauty. Take in the location, its fresh air and charm and you’ll understand that this varied landscape allows you to find your own way around the valley. Sneak through the gloomy forests and woodland, venture into the open swamps and wetlands, or if you’re lucky enough to find a working truck, jump in and put the pedal to the metal.Lose yourself in this living and breathing locale, that’s so real you can feel the tension in the air. Experience dynamic and unpredictable weather that will affect how you play as it impacts your visibility, your environments and even how enemies behave.

Firefighter Gear Parts — You’ll find yourself in situations that are life and death. These gear parts are your best form of protection and reduce stamina usage. Firefighter Axe (weapon + blueprint) — When bringing the heat to the zombies, the firefighter axe is a reliable tool for getting through enemies with its burning effect. Firefighter Paraglider — Because sometimes you need to jump from a burning building and pray you survive the drop. Firefighter Hook — Originally designed to help firefighters escape fiery situations, this tool has now found a new purpose in handling the zombies. Fire Brigade Cap Charm — It might be too small for your head, but your weapon sure could use all the protection it can get to enhance its durability. https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/534380/Dying_Light_2_Stay_Human_Reloaded_Edition/",1745334141,

Some audiences might have been concerned that the studio's next game, the upcoming Dying Light: The Beast, would shift attention away from the team's prior work, but, fortunately, as we've just learned through an interview with the series' franchise director, this doesn't seem to be the case. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/continued-support"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/spring-update"">Acclaimed zombie game Dying Light 2 gets a huge update and Steam discount</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/sale-humble-bundle"">Beloved zombie game Dying Light 2 is super cheap, but not for much longer</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/tower-raid-back"">Dying Light 2's Tower Raid co-op mode is back for good, and better than ever</a> ",1745259477,
534380,Acclaimed zombie game Dying Light 2 gets a huge update and Steam discount,"<strong>Dying Light 2</strong> is one of the most entertaining horror titles in recent years, even if it hasn't reached the lofty heights of the original. Now, with a sequel dropping in 2025, developer Techland has rolled out a massive new update and slashed the price of the game on Steam. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/spring-update"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/continued-support"">Despite Dying Light The Beast, Techland promises it won't abandon Dying Light 2</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/sale-humble-bundle"">Beloved zombie game Dying Light 2 is super cheap, but not for much longer</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/tower-raid-back"">Dying Light 2's Tower Raid co-op mode is back for good, and better than ever</a> ",1744990249,

This patch introduces updated rewards in Tower Raid that will enrich your main character’s arsenal, continues to improve co-op and gives you creative control over how Villedor looks and feels. Starting next week, you’ll also be able to step into the shoes of real heroes with the new Fire Brigade Bundle. Tower Raid — new weapons and rewards The latest patch introduces an expanded arsenal with the addition of 27 new weapons (including 24 Elemental Weapons and 3 Elemental Pistols you asked for as well), each offering unique capabilities and strategic advantages, encouraging players to explore and adapt their gameplay styles. In tandem with this, the rewards have been updated, offering an array of enticing exclusive skins and other items. Among these rewards, you can find a highly anticipated Breach outfit that allows you to roam the city with the first of the original Tower Raid skins. Additionally, we've implemented several UX improvements to ensure a seamless reward experience. Players can now claim rewards at their convenience, eliminating the risk of missing out on unlocked items. Furthermore, we've enhanced communication on the HUD to clearly indicate when rewards are earned, ensuring that players are always informed about their progress and achievements. Co-op improvements In the Spring Update, you’ll experience a slew of enhancements designed to elevate your co-op experience. We have addressed and resolved various enemy behavior issues affected by synchronization between players. This intends to ensure smoother gameplay and reduced discrepancies, including the amount of enemies teleporting and lagging. The HUD has also received substantial improvements, providing clearer visual cues and streamlined access to vital information, ultimately enhancing situational awareness with multiple players on screen. We're not stopping here, though! The co-op feature remains a key focus, and we've been making steady progress on it over the past few months. Our commitment to enhancing it will continue into the future. Visual Mods tool Ever wished you could change a specific detail in Villedor? Add a splash of color here, or add a darker, moodier atmosphere there? Look no further as we’re thrilled to introduce a new visual mods tool to Dying Light 2 Developer Tools. Currently available for PC, it offers a wide range of customization options, allowing players to modify textures in the environment, on weapons and even clothing. While visual mods are only available on PC for now, we’re hard at work making them available on consoles soon to encourage the entire community to get even more creative! Game Updates Aside from all the big news from Update 1.22 above, we’ve also introduced the following fixes and improvements to the game: Co-op Fixed the issue with GRE Aberration teleporting in co-op during its mission Fixed the issue with Volatiles occasionally teleporting between ground and higher surfaces Fixed the issue with the van conversation not playing until all players are nearby during The Breakthrough quest Tower Raid Fixed the issue with Biters sometimes teleporting while traversing climbable objects, e.g., tables Fixed the issue with Tower Raid achievements tracking the wrong kind of damage (blunt instead of slashing) Fixed the issue with the slope on the upper part of the roof causing Virals and Biters to slide while in a frozen pose Fixed the issue with the wardrobe not being moved for peers when the host is too far from them in co-op Fixed the meshes of firearms found in chests Fixed the issue where the player might become stuck when sliding between multiple tables and sofas Gameplay Fixed the issue with some ranged weapons and tools’ sound sometimes glitching when used during Parkour Shot Fixed the issue with ragdolls sometimes not applying correctly when performing ground pound Fixed the issue with the enemy not being synced properly during finishers in tight spaces Fixed the issue of allowing players to get outside the elevator cabin Technical Fixed the issue with the Snake Warrior’s boots sometimes displaying Killer Krampus boots Fixed the issue of audio sometimes missing in random parts of the cutscene right after skipping the prologue Fixed the issue with the map sometimes showing only icons Fixed various crashes Fixed the issue when sometimes hanging from the metro wagon will cause Aiden to get sent into the air Fixed the issue when the player receives less XP upon killing multiple enemies simultaneously Fixed the issue with PS5 Haptic Feedback sometimes not working properly after performing specific actions Fixed the issue where weapons would sometimes stay in the hands of the character model during various animations Fixed the issue with some weapons missing shadows Fixed the issue with the game crashing when the player continuously fast travels between metro station...",1744898872,

534380,"Beloved zombie game Dying Light 2 is super cheap, but not for much longer","We love a bit of Dying Light here at PCGamesN - both the original and its more polished, expansive sequel. While it may lack the deep lore and co-op novelty of Call of Duty Zombies, the brutal survival experience of DayZ, or the properly dark scares of Resident Evil, I still think <strong>Dying Light 2</strong> is one of the most underrated zombie games around. Sure, it's beloved by millions already, but it just never seems to get the levels of praise it deserves. Open-world exploration, a gameplay-altering day-night cycle, slick parkour, and satisfying combat combine to create a really enjoyable experience.

534380,Dying Light 2's roguelike Tower Raid is returning to the zombie game for good,"Techland's <strong>Dying Light 2</strong> remains one of the most popular zombie experiences on Steam. Resident Evil has the classic survival horror; Project Zomboid brings the survival strategy; DayZ integrates multiplayer tension; Dead Island 2 is a colorful arcade romp; and Left 4 Dead 2 delivers co-op coordination. But Dying Light's blend of open-world parkour and brutal FPS combat makes it a real winner - and as Techland celebrates its third anniversary with a new update, it confirms that a fan-favorite mode is finally arriving as a permanent fixture. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/tower-raid-permanent"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/fanatical/dying-light-2-over-60-off"">Before Dying Light The Beast, grab its prequel at over 60% off</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/balatro-crossover"">Dying Light 2 gets a new Balatro collab, and it's absolutely horrifying</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/continued-support"">Despite Dying Light The Beast, Techland promises it won't abandon Dying Light 2</a> ",1738769091,
534380,Update 1.21 — Anniversary Update,"It's the third anniversary for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and last week was the 10th anniversary of the franchise! Three years (and a few updates) later, we want to thank you for your constant support and head straight to the good stuff. So without further ado, let’s see what we have prepared for you in this time of celebration! Anniversary Features For starters, head over to Photo Mode, where you can find a brand new, Anniversary-themed frame! Don’t be shy, either; we want to see your fanciest virtual photos created with this new addition. Be sure to follow us on our social media and maybe soon enough you’ll have an opportunity to put it to the real test. The new frame is also a great opportunity to take photos of the new billboards we have put up around the Villedor! Reckon you can find them all? And last but not least, we’ve added new bounties for you, so head to Pilgrim Outpost to find them and during our celebrations, there will be a series of festive events - both in Dying Light 2: Stay Human and Dying Light! Tower Raid Permanent Release (Coming February 19) During our anniversary celebrations is the best moment to release Tower Raid as a standalone mode to the game, so expect it to be live later this month. We gathered tons of feedback from you and incorporated it into the game. You will soon be able to access Tower Raid through the main menu, where you will be transported to the Raid Hub. It’s a new place where you can enter the Tower Raid and visit shops associated with its progression. Here, you can find a familiar face — Jai. If you don’t know, he’s a vendor with his own persistent Reputation progression and an inventory designed specifically for Tower Raid and its characters (new perks, tools, and weapons). While in the Raid Hub, make sure to also check what new vendor, Sola, has to offer — complete her assignments to obtain rewards that transfer into the base game. When you feel ready to take on the Tower Raid, it’s time to pick your character, perks, and all the details that will shape your next run from the board. Alongside the two modes you already know, Normal and Elite, we’ve added a third: Quick, which will run you through 4 floors and a rooftop fight. Or if you want a deeper and longer challenge, try Elite Mode: navigate 12 floors on Hard or Nightmare difficulty with additional modifiers on top. And if you choose Quick or Normal, you can also choose a difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard, or Nightmare) for each Tower Raid run. And finally, we’ve added new floors to the rotation! We can’t wait for you to play it when it releases later this month. New Rewards and Bundles The anniversary celebration is on, and it keeps on giving! You still have a chance to collect the Lunar Offerings until February 12. Unlock the Snake Warrior Bundle complete with a whole moto biker outfit for Aiden on Pilgrim Outpost. And remember to check your in-game stash to find an optional, snake-themed makeover for Lawan! Make sure to visit the Pilgrim Outpost’s Armory for brand new additions for both Dying Light and Dying Light 2: Stay Human, too. And that’s still not all: we’ve prepared some new bundles and weapon packs that will be available for you later this month. Game Updates Aside from all the big news from Update 1.21 above, we’ve also introduced the following fixes and improvements to the game: Co-op Fixed electric and fire VFX visible from the third-person perspective Improved VFX of Evolving items when seen from the third-person perspective Tower Raid Closed gaps in selected areas Fixed soft locks on selected floors Fixed random flickering on selected floors Cosmetic changes to selected floors (cleaning up assets that shouldn’t be visible, overlapping) Fixed an issue with co-op players disappearing when in an elevator Fixed soft locks related to co-op joins Fixed accessing drawer through the wall Updated animation for pressing floor buttons while in the elevator Gameplay Implemented changes for the prologue to improve its flow Adjusted first GRE encounter difficulty Rebalanced the prologue to make players feel stronger (extra skills and weapons) Fixed the missing quest marker for the ‘Crystal White’ mission Fixed issues with the Crowd Runner skill while using firearms layout (equipped firearms must be holstered in order to trigger it while moving forward) Police cars are now lootable Encounters between survivors and zombies can be interrupted with a kick After throwing a weapon, the next equipped one will be drawn (even if not equipped in the first slot) Technical Fixed audio issues related to sound disappearing Fixed biomarker placement on Krampus Outfit Removed Tower Raid pop-up after canceling any Survivor Mission Fixed bow and arrow alignment Fixed hand placement on ladder when looking around Fixed animations after using Afterboost so it now works properly Fixed occasional misalignment of the Scorpio weapon Funkadelic bow can no longer be dropped (and lost) Fixed elemental VFX on Kama Fixed rain falli...",1738753973,

534380,Watch the New Dying Light: The Beast Trailer,"Meet the Baron: an emotionless, calculating, but brilliant scientist. Brace yourself to encounter the biggest threat Kyle Crane has ever faced – the man who brutally experimented on him for over a decade. His real name is Marius Fischer, the last descendant of a noble big pharma dynasty from Castor Woods. Convinced that the remnants of humanity who survived the outbreak are weak, he sees it as his moral right and highest duty to restore order. To achieve this, he's deep into experimenting with sinister virus strains, pursuing his grand design that still remains a mystery to everyone, including Kyle Crane, who is nothing but a tiny piece in the vast puzzle the Baron is putting together. He doesn’t revel in the pain he is causing, but accepts the necessity of the suffering inflicted on his subjects as a mere side effect needed to succeed in his trials. After all, the greater good justifies all means. Survivors need your rage Experience firsthand the torment that Kyle Crane has endured over 13 long years. Seeing his suffering, it becomes clear why his thirst for revenge is so intense; but giving in to this animalistic instinct could be a slippery slope as Kyle now possesses extraordinary, beastlike powers. If unleashed recklessly, he risks becoming the very monster he despises. And with the fate of survivors and factions in the Castor Woods valley hanging in the balance, the stakes couldn't be higher. Kyle chooses to fight for the survival of the people who depend on him, keeping his inner beast in check to prevent it from taking over. For now. Evolution of the Dying Light formula Dive into the new trailer for Dying Light: The Beast that teases new immersive gameplay. Witness a high-fidelity, intricately crafted open world filled with diverse areas, each meticulously designed and uniquely different, ready to be discovered. The post-apocalyptic Castor Woods comes alive with small, detailed touches in the new interiors and dynamic weather changes that make you feel as though you’re right there, a part of the immersive environment like the Swamps — a new area shown in the trailer. Revel in the visceral combat by taking full advantage of the realistic physics of the environment, complete with liberating movement that combines the best parkour elements for you to use as you navigate through varied terrains. See Baron’s Laboratory, where new threats introduce atmospheric gameplay horror, and glimpse a presentation of the new type of Virals that the Baron is using as soldiers. And be careful, as the night and day system introduces even more new threats, as you can quickly end up alone in the middle of the forest as the sun sets. Unleash the Beast in Summer 2025 Reaching 1,000,000 wishlists in less than 10 weeks is a testament to the incredible support we’ve received from our community. For this reason, we are thrilled to announce that Dying Light: The Beast will be released in Summer 2025 and will be available on PC, PlayStation and Xbox. https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/ ",1734057999,['workshop']

Complete the bounties on offer from Baka or loot containers to get your hands on a mixture of trinkets, ornaments and other decorations, then dress the tree to make sure the holiday cheer spreads for all to hear! For your hard work, you’ll be rewarded with presents, such as the Killer Krampus Outfit, and Winter Sweets, which can be spent at Baka’s stall. But what’s on offer? Baka’s Back with His (Festive) Shack For someone locked up in a cage, he certainly moves quickly. The Halloween stand has been exchanged for something more festive and offers up some great and unique items, including the boomerang-style Skoll, Snowballs and much, much more. He has also ordered some new stock with the Killer Krampus items, including The Punisher weapon, used to reprimand those naughty zombies. So before taking on any bounties, make sure to check out all of Baka’s wares! Killer Krampus Has Come, To Give You a Fright While Baka has a selection of the Killer Krampus items, there’s some that he couldn’t get in stock before the festive rush. That’s where Santa, and his contactless delivery service, comes in! With each level increase of Baka’s reputation, you will get a letter you can send to Santa using the box located next to the stall. Once you send it, an airdrop (and its presents) will be comin’ in hot, so you best get your best running shoes on. What awaits you at the dropsite? Well… Jingle All the Slay The dreaded Uncle Snows and their minions, the Naughty Infected and Virals, are back and out for blood. And now there’s a new festive zombie type in town: the Ice Spitter. As the name suggests, they will shoot icy projectiles, so watch out! While you will find those Naughty Infected all over Villedor, the most hardened Uncle Snows will be making sure that no one gets their hands on those airdrops that promise worthwhile rewards! Be sure to get involved in the airdrops each week as the rewards inside will change, allowing you to get the entire Killer Krampus Gear Set for free. The Uncle Snows will put up one hell of a fight, but you can level the playing field with Winter Boons. By killing certain Naughty Infected, you have the chance to get these buffs, and yes, you can stack them! One More Update for 2024… Alongside the release of Winter Tales: Gifts from Above 2024, we’ll be releasing Patch 1.20. This patch will streamline the Prologue so players can get into the action much quicker, making it the perfect time to jump into the game for the first time, or finally return to see what else has changed since your last visit to Villedor. The patch also addresses various issues, including those relating to crashes and co-op, and several that have been reported by the community, such as the headless Aiden during the stomp animation. …And One More Present for You All! This is the season for giving after all, so until January 2, all players will be able to grab the Above the Law Bundle completely for free. Just like the Killer Krampus, this bundle is all about making sure those not following the rules get punished, so pick it up and keep law and order in The City. And if anyone gives you any grief, pull out the Seesaw Saw to show them you really mean business! Winter Tales: Gifts from Above 2024 will run from December 11 until January 2. Prologue Improvements We decided to take a look at the prologue and introduce some improvements that would enhance the beginning of the game. Our main goal was to create a more streamlined experience with more readable and easier-to-follow objectives. We have also added some new tutorials, adjusted wordings, rebalanced some early weapons, and reworked the introduction of some early-game features. As a result, it’s now even easier to jump into the game, get to Villedor and make your name among the survivors! Game Updates Along with those improvements to the prologue, Update 1.20 introduced the following fixes and improvements to...",1733929601,

Typically, we explore the zombie FPS at will, parkouring over obstacles and buildings, and eliminating the undead with whatever comes to hand. Now, the fantastic roguelike-style mode Tower Raid is back, offering a supremely tough challenge where anything goes. At the same time, Dying Light patch 1.19 overhauls the control scheme and makes weapon handling way more intuitive. While the first game is having a resurgence on Steam and rivals like Left 4 Dead and State of Decay remain popular, this is definitely the right time to give Dying Light 2 another shot. <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/tower-raid-is-back"">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/alteration-melee-combat"">Surprise Dying Light 2 update transforms how you play the zombie game</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/epic-games-store-halloween-sale"">Dying Light 2 and dozens of other spooky bangers up to 80% off in new sale</a> <a href=""https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light-2/techland-new-game"">Dying Light 2 dev hints at mysterious, totally unannounced new game</a> ",1730292643,

Nightmarish creatures have awoken under the All Hallows' Eve moon and stormed the Tower. Now, it's your job to take them on with your friends. You'll be duly rewarded for doing so with Halloween Candies that can be used to get all the items from the brand new Van Aiden Bundle and more! Baka also makes his return, you can find him hanging out outside the Bazaar and he’s fully restocked his assortment, including items from last year’s Halloween event. It’s also here that you can enter the Tower, via the bulletin board. If you had any leftover (and now likely stale) candies from last Halloween, we'll convert them into new, fresh ones to spend at Baka's. And you'll want to spend every single one you have as after the event, they'll magically disappear. Once you’ve made your way in, you’ll be asked to choose one of four themed-characters. So unlike the Open Beta, you will get a preset loadout based on which character you pick. Each of them have their own traits and weapons, so try them all out and find the one that best suits your style! These spooky characters are: - Scarecrow - Van Aiden - Plague - Cursed Pirate And don’t panic if you fall at the first hurdle, Tower Raid is meant to be hard. But with each death, you have the opportunity to get stronger with the perks system. Some are personal, while others will affect everyone in your session if you are the host! For those of you who have leftover (and probably stale) Treats from last year, we'll be converting them to fresh Halloween Candies for you to spend at Baka's. You'll receive 1 Halloween Candy for every 5 Treats, up to a maximum of 1000 Halloween Candies. Any Treats left over after that will be converted to Mutation Samples at a rate of 1 Mutation Sample for every 4 Treats. After familiarizing yourself with the event, you might decide you want even more of a challenge. Ask and you shall receive! From November 6, you'll be able to take on Elite Mode, where enemies are harder to kill and deal more damage, but you'll have access to certain special bounties! And from November 13, we'll be introducing a new group of bounties which will be available to all players, no matter whether you're playing Elite Mode or not. So go out there and test your might against the Tower. Tower Raid: Halloween Run will be available until November 20. https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/",1730290865,
534380,Patch 19 and a New Episode of Dying 2 Know More,"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/35210443/c951eeaeb9c670cdd2d6a8510bbffa097fa3d2c8.png It is that time of the year when Villedor gets eerie! The Tower Raid’s doors are open once again, and this time it’s going to be spooky! Get ready for new weapons, a new final boss, and a brand new Halloween event! So without further ado, let’s see what we’ve cooked up for you! Dying 2 Know More: Halloween… And Beyond We just dropped a new episode of Dying 2 Know More, in which we sat down with the director of this year’s Halloween event, Alexandre Breault. We also delved into the future of Dying Light 2: Stay Human with the Franchise Director, Tymon Smektała, and Franchise Executive Producer, Bruno Guerin. Check it out below: While on the topic of Tower Raid: Halloween Run, let’s take a look at more of the details! Tower Raid: Halloween Run Tower Raid returns, but this time the scare factor has been increased! But what does that mean exactly? New rewards and new candies. But don’t worry, good ol’ Baka’s will be waiting for you outside the Bazaar, accessible right after you’ve completed the prologue. Wait, what was that about new candies? Yes! At the start of the event, we’ll convert all your leftover Treats from last year’s event into fresh Halloween Candies (it’s not good to be eating stale candy, even in a post-apocalyptic world). For every 5 Treats, you’ll be gifted 1 Halloween Candy, up to a maximum of 1000 Halloween Candies. If you’ve got more than 5000 Treats, don’t panic. Any Treats you have left over from the conversion to Halloween Candies will be transformed into Mutation Samples, at a rate of 1 per 4 Treats. That was a bit heavy on the math, so let’s get into what you can expect from the event: New Levels Tower Raids are ever-growing, so we’ve prepared for you 3 brand new hotel-themed floors (making it a total of 12 you can now explore). The floors are now divided into 4 sub-themes with 3 floors for each. Every run will pick 2 random floors per sub-theme, making a total of 8 you’ll have to conquer before reaching the rooftop, where the new final boss will be waiting. To spice things up, each floor will have a random gameplay modifier, so expect each run to be different from the last! But we might be getting ahead of ourselves, after all, you’ll need to pick a character before any of this! Characters Halloween is all about playing a character, but your choice here goes a bit deeper than that. You won’t be picking a mere costume, but a loadout, trait and playstyle. So let’s take a look at the brand new character system. Before each run, you’ll have to choose from four Halloween-inspired characters: Scarecrow (Tank) - Perfect for those who want to be in the thick of the action, thanks to his trusty scythe and increased HP pool Plague (Brawler) - Show the zombies that YOU are the plague infesting Villedor. Deliver a different type of medicine with your cane and your increased one-handed damage. Van Aiden (Ranger) - Don’t want to get your hands dirty? Then don’t! Grab your crossbow and wreak havoc from afar with increased ranged damage. Cursed Pirate (Specialist) - The seven seas are nothing compared to the Tower. Make your foes walk the plank, and if they resist, give them a little kick with increased parkour damage! Unlike the Tower Raid Open Beta, what you have on you when you head to the Tower won’t matter as you’ll be given a preset loadout based on the character you choose. And, don’t hoard what you find in the Tower as it will be removed once you finish your run. And you’ll want to test out each of the characters, not just for a different experience, but you’ll receive a special weapon the first time you complete a run as that character. So, in total, there’s 4 unique items for you to get your hands on! But wait, there’s more! New Shop and Rewards Baka’s back, alright! And so is his shop. Alongside the rewards from last year, he’s also stocked up on a fresh batch, too! The highlight of his wares this year is the Van Aiden Bundle items, so you can grab the outfit, his weapons and everything else for Halloween Candies. You’ll also want to pick up some bounties from Baka as they’ll reward you with more than a handful of Halloween Candies. If you find yourself struggling with Tower Raid, you can pick up some perks to give you advantages when in the Tower. There are two types of Perks: Session Perks: These are purchased with Halloween Candies, but only one can be active during a Tower Raid run, so choose wisely. If you’re playing in co-op, only the host will be able to select which Session Perk will be active. Character Perks: These are special modifiers that are available for Perk Points only and will permanently affect your runs, granting some unique benefits (e.g. faster healing). Utilize their power and battle to the top! Perk Points are obtained by leveling up Baka and each level increase rewards you with a Perk Point. Baka can be leveled up to Level 25, meaning there’s a maximum of 24 Perk Points to earn this way. You wi...",1730289753,
