2073850,Season 9 is LIVE!,"WELCOME TO SEASON 9 | DRAGON RISING Dragon Rising draws from the depth and richness of Chinese culture with a blend of historic symbols, architectural styles, and modern city energy. There’s a new mode, a new Arena, and plenty more to uncover, so let’s take a look at Dragon Rising and dive into a fresh season of the World’s Greatest Gameshow.To experience the full visual patch notes please click this link. New Map | Fangwai City Fangwai City is built for spectacle, with elevated walkways, dense apartment blocks, riverfront views, serene gardens and towering structures all blended together for the ultimate variety. This latest addition to the Arena is built from the ground up with smooth destruction, combining everything we have learned from the past two years, to create a battleground that puts Dynamism on the center stage! Distinct zones with strong individual personalities that draw from multiple real world locations in China, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, create a playground of variety. Explore the vertical routes, the winding pathways, but don’t forget to look up at the electric backdrop of a city that never sleeps. This megacity is grand, it’s loud, it’s tuned to keep the action flowing, and it’s coming for the crown. Step into your new favorite map! New Mode | Point Break Take everything you know about Cashout, turn it up to 11, and add four more players! Point Break delivers a rolling battle where the fight is always in motion, the stakes rise with every phase, and every decision carries weight. It’s fast, it’s messy, and it brings a new rhythm to THE FINALS.As you load into Point Break you find yourself as one of eight Attackers or Defenders, each side with a clear goal. Attackers need to gain control of, and destroy, nine Grand Vaults before running out of respawn tokens while Defenders aim to do the opposite. Deplete the Attackers coins and victory is yours, but be vigilant as they gain more coins for each phase they complete. Go play! New Progression | World Tour 2.0 World Tour is now your one stop shop for all game modes! What used to be a single game mode is now a full progression system that tracks everything you do across THE FINALS. Whether you sweat it out in Ranked, push the Platform in Power Shift, or chase eliminations in TDM, every match pushes you toward your seasonal goals! For fans of the old World Tour Tournament Mode, it’s still here, but now it’s called Cashout! Your World Tour Badge progresses regardless of what you play and as you advance, you’ll earn Stickers, Charms, Multibucks, and Emerald rewards delivered to you at the start of the next season! Your effort now builds toward one track, making progress simpler, smoother, and more rewarding. You’ll still earn Ranked Rewards separately, allowing the most competitive Contestants to earn additional rewards for climbing the ranks in Ranked Cashout! Reward System | Reward Coins Gone are the days of receiving pre-determined skins at the end of a season! If you’ve had ambitious dreams of an emerald Dagger, that is now your choice to make! Does the thought of a golden Famas make your eyes sparkle? You can pick that, too! Introducing Reward Coins: the brand new way for you to choose any weapon skin your heart desires, based on your Ranked and World Tour progress. There are Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Ruby coins earned through Ranked Cashout, and an Emerald Coin awarded for reaching the top Badge level in World Tour.Sponsors | VOLPE, OSPUZE, and any one you choose!  You can now sign with any Sponsor you like, whenever you like, and swap them at any time. No more being locked in. This update is about giving you freedom, choice, and a reason to mix things up. We are also adding new loyalty tracks for the official Sponsors of Season 9, VOLPE and OSPUZE.You can go with a Seasonal Sponsor, return to your favorite, or try a little bit of everything. The CEOs are watching, so you can prove your loyalty or leave them wondering if you’ll ever return! The Fans you earn will only go to the active Sponsor you have signed with at any given moment, so make sure you sign before stepping into the Arena. Don’t worry about the fine print! Which brand will you wear today, Contestant? Cashout Rules | Double JeopardyA new rule is coming to Cashout in the form of Double Jeopardy, a condition triggered whenever a second Cashbox is inserted in an already active Cashout Station. When a team initiates Double Jeopardy, if they are in control of the Cashout Station as it completes, they bank all the money as normal, but if they fail to secure it they lose 50% of their current cash total. ‘Doubling’ is now a high risk strategy, allowing struggling teams to catch up, while increasing the risk for those ahead. Battle Pass | Free, Premium, and Ultimate The Battle Pass carries the spirit of Dragon Rising across every tier. The Free path gives all players a collection of rewards that showcase the season’s blend of heritage and future tech. The Premium Pass opens a wi...",1765382712,['vo_marketing_message']

These improvements are shaping the future of the game, but they also demand more from the hardware that runs it.As we continue to advance, it’s become increasingly difficult to maintain and optimize PlayStation 4 support, without limiting the features and gamemodes we want to create. Some of our latest systems simply aren’t compatible with the older generation’s technology, and ensuring an identical experience for our players across all platforms means making some tough trade-offs.When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring the PlayStation 4 version of THE FINALS and focusing our support on newer platforms. From that point on you’ll need to play on one of those platforms to keep enjoying the game (your progress and purchases will be stored in your Embark ID and will transfer to anywhere you choose to play). We’re finalizing the details now and we’ll share more information shortly. Our focus now is on delivering the best possible experience across modern platforms where we can take full advantage of the tech that drives THE FINALS forward.We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been part of the PS4 community! REWARDS | TWITCH DROPS To celebrate the release of OSPUZE SOUR CORE in the meatspace we’ve got a brand new suite of refreshing Twitch Drops coming your way!

It was all about giving players agency, creativity, and the ability to shape their own experience. We gave this philosophy a name: Dynamism! In this episode of MAKING THE FINALS, our Creative Director, Gustav Tilleby Silow, explains Dynamism and walks us through the journey of making the world’s first Dynamism Shooter.Packed with footage that dates back to the earliest days of Development, you'll learn what steps we took at Embark Studios to ensure that THE FINALS could live up to our dream of being a Dynamism-based shooter from the very beginning, to now.

Unfortunately, this fix had some unintended impacts so we have reverted that change, which means the old Dematerializer issue will be back until we find another approach. It should be noted here that separate to this change, we made a fix in 8.0 that causes deployables’ preview meshes to only appear when the player is allowed to deploy them. This should make it more reliable to deploy, and avoid that old feeling that the input was being ignored because the mesh showed up too early. The ‘time to deploy’ for these items is still the same as prior to 8.0, this is just a visual change and it is not related to the revert mentioned above. SpecializationsEvasive DashFixed an issue where hitting jump immediately after dashing would cause a ‘super-dash’ to occur, sending the player much further than intendedWeaponsDaggerFixed an issue where releasing the secondary attack early, before fully charged, could cause distorted and stuck sound effectsPike-556Fixed an issue where the Pike had the wrong headshot bonus.

2073850,Season 8 is LIVE!,"SEASON 8 | GAME TIME THE WORLD IS WATCHING It’s time to unite! This is the main event, Contestants. With all eyes on the grandest of stages, if there ever was a moment to play your best, this is it. The game is on. The greatest gameshow on Earth is back for another season! This is THE FINALS. Flags will fly, cultures will shine, and Contestants from all over the globe will step into the spotlight for a showdown of epic proportions! The Arena is set, revamped, and ready to host the World's biggest competition! It's GAME TIME!For a more complete version of the Notes, visit the News Page! INSTANT REPLAY Instant Replay Beta has landed and it's nothing short of magical! Want to know what just turned you into a pile of coins? Now you can! This is mind-bending tech that fuses destruction physics, dynamic environments, and fast-paced action into a full clip, live, and just for you.This feature is rolling out in beta as we learn from it. It’s technically wild, and we’re beyond proud. It plays back your elimination moments so you can actually see what happened in that fast-moving, destructible chaos we call THE FINALS. The clarity it delivers is game-changing.To be honest, at first and second glance, this was an impossible task. But at Embark we take a challenge seriously. Prototypes for this feature date back to the early days of the project, before THE FINALS even had a name, trying to prove it possible. What you will see in Season 8 is the result of all that hard work. We had to calculate everything that matters: player movement, environmental destruction, object interactions in a level of data fidelity that’s hard to pull off in a Dynamism Shooter. Then take all that info and quickly reconstruct the moment. It’s not enabled for everyone by default (especially on systems under 16 GB RAM), but you can toggle it on manually. If you’ve got the horsepower, turn it on, try it, and tell us what you think. We’ll be gathering feedback, polishing performance, and expanding integration throughout the season.In THE FINALS, the Arena is a living, crumbling, ever-changing beast. Instant Replay offers a path to smarter plays and sharper instincts. Give it a try! MATCH RECAP We’re rolling out a brand-new match summary screen for World Tour, Ranked and QuickCash, with more Modes to come. It features a timeline graph of important scoring events. You’ll also see a personal breakdown of your own performance, with ratings across Combat, Support, Objective score, and more. You’ll see how it all played out and your own contribution to the team effort! Rise to the challenge and aim to be spectacular! And should you successfully end a round with nothing but S-ranks across the board, tag us and let us know! WEAPONS OLD AND NEW Season 8 comes with two new Weapons that are bound to change the game in new and exciting ways: BFR TITAN | Heavy The BFR Titan is a high caliber, manual action revolver that deals immense damage. With its low ammo count and individually reloaded rounds, it's ideal for those who want to hold the edge of the encounter and pick off their targets, one bullet at a time. P90 | Medium The P90 is a submachine gun with a compact design and high capacity magazine. Unload a barrage at shorter ranges, or pester targets from further away by raining bullets! Get ready to spray and pray, contestants!Weapons System We’re also migrating more weapons over to our new Weapons System, which is way more robust and reliable than the old one! This is a long-term initiative and we’re taking it step-by-step to make sure this first phase is done right. Several Weapons are migrating over to the new system and more will make the move during Season 8. It is our ambition to finally put an end to some of the longest standing weapon related bugs in THE FINALS, once and for all.Dematerializer Improvements We’ve reworked the Dematerializer to be more reliable when opening and closing segments and to provide a more accurate aim when it comes to aiming your wall removal. We’ve also added an off-screen indicator that will help other Contestants know when a wall has been opened nearby to them. Grenade Indicator Watch out! We’ve added a Frag Grenade indicator for better readability on your imminent detonation, players should now have a bit more time to react to live Grenades. This has been a requested feature for some time, watch your six and stay safe out there, Contestants!  SMOOTH DESTRUCTION Welcome to the first release of a feature we’re calling Smooth Destruction. Until recently, impact damage from collapsing structures wasn’t really there. With this new update, we’re dialing up the cascading damage that can occur when buildings or objects fall into others. Starting with suspended structures and cranes, making these crash down can cause real damage and totally reshape the environment, creating new emergent play spaces in the process! Smooth destruction introduces knock-on effects and chain reactions that open up new tactical and strategic options. ...",1757519389,"['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_1691520782_1757521614_0', 'mod_require_rereview']"

It’s been a challenge to find the root cause, but this week we finally managed to reproduce the issue! This means we are getting closer to finding a permanent solution. While we work on figuring out how to eradicate this issue, it’s good to know that the game runs smoother with more memory, so closing any memory-hungry applications (such as Chrome) while playing can help with overall performance. STORE Amongst the latest Store additions, say hello to Hammerhead Ned, suitably accompanied by lightning VFX and monstrous voice effects! Make sure to check out the Store this week! Balance ChangesGadgets Goo GrenadeCooldown increased from 20s to 30sDev Note: We’ve noticed the prevalence of goo increasing a little over time, to the point where we think it can now be a little too disruptive to some encounters. This change should reduce the frequency of goo usage slightly ModesCashout (World Tour)Vaults/Cash Boxes that have not been delivered to a Cashout Station by the time overtime starts will no longer despawn, reverting a change made in 7.6. This change only impacts World Tour. In Ranked, Vaults/Cash Boxes that have not been delivered will continue to despawn when overtime startsDev Note: We’ve been monitoring the 7.6 change and are seeing fewer double-stacked cash boxes (especially Tier 3) and a slight drop in third-party fights. These were both expected outcomes. That said, we’re not fully convinced it’s the right long-term solution. The despawn rule feels more disruptive in World Tour, where team wipe penalties aren’t in play. So for now, we’re disabling it there but keeping it active and under review in Ranked. Weapons 93RDecreased rate of fire from 220 to 210, making the weapon slightly slowerDev Note: We’ve been monitoring the 93R since buffing it in update 7.0. The buff improved the weapon considerably, and even made it a touch too strong. We think this small change will better align it with other Light weapons. Cerberus 12GADecreased the radius of the pellet distribution by approximately 10%, making the weapon more accurateIncreased the heat applied to world objects by the Cerberus from 2.5 to 7.5, meaning it will now ignite toxic gas clouds in a single shotDev Note: Since our last round of Cerberus changes the weapon has dropped dramatically in usage across all modes and skill tiers. We want to buff its viability, without returning to its previous overpowered state and we hope these changes will have that effect.    Model 1887Increase maximum ammo capacity from 6 to 7Dev Note: The Model is in a very similar place to the Cerberus, with very low usage and poor performance metrics right now. This subtle change should buff its viability without over-tuning its power. SledgehammerSecondary attack damage increased from 154 to 175Dev Note: We’re continuing to monitor and adjust the Sledgehammer. This damage buff to the secondary attack will boost its value compared to primary attacks. We’d also like to note we’re aware of some hit registration issues with the Sledeghammer which we’re currently investigatin...",1755171010,

Have a blast in the Arena! IMPROVED DESTRUCTIONDestruction is at the very core of THE FINALS. Where would we be without it? With this update, we're dialing up the dynamism, realism, and tactical payoff of destruction in several key ways. Here's what’s new, and how it improves the experience: DESTRUCTION PHYSICSFirst of all, we are implementing new destruction features which make buildings collapse in a realistic and much cooler way! IN KYOTO: The Pagoda in Kyoto was always a beautiful collapse waiting to happen. The updates to destruction will help it fall more naturally, collapsing under its own weight and crumbling down in a way that feels grounded and satisfying. Knock it down and see! IN SKYWAY STADIUM:Structures in Skyway Stadium have been updated with the new destruction features, causing them to destroy more realistically! You’ll see that buildings can now deal damage to the other structures as they collapse, creating awesome knock-on effects. In this map and others, we’re improving the way that buildings break apart under their own weight, where they crumble more realistically, and so that even after a lot of destruction, the level design stays interesting and playable.DESTRUCTION VISUALS The visuals of the damaged edges around destroyed surfaces have been improved. The size of these visuals have been reduced so that players can make better judgements about where the damage is. These visuals are also more consistent, seamless, and appear more accurately. This is all part of an effort to improve clarity, and to help players quickly see the cause and effect of their interaction with the environment!WE’RE NOT DONE YETWe’ve already rolled out plenty of these improvements in many of the maps, so jump in-game and feel it out for yourself! This is just the beginning, expect to see more destruction improvements in the future!WORLD TOUR It’s CNS’ turn to take over the World Tour, and they’re restoring Standard Cashout. They want you to see through the walls, but not with VAIIYA’s technology. It’s time to open your eyes. We also have a stacked store update, including a fun celebration for the 4th of July! With over 20 new items added, you’re sure to find something that catches your eye. Mesh hoodwear? Check. Prefer sending a message through rocket propelled fists? Check.

Starting today you will be able to select separate intro and winner’s emotes, so you can give your opponents a curated “Hello!” and “Goodbye!” DOJO IMPROVEMENTSThe smarties (our smart dummies in the Practice Range) have been taking their Omega-3 supplements and have now improved even further! These even smarter smarties fight with more brainpower, and have been balanced to give you a fairer challenge! Oh, and whether you had mastered the Big Box Battle, or struggled to complete it, there’s something new for you: we have added an Easy and Hard version of the challenge! Let’s get into all the changes in detail:Balance ChangesGadgets H+ InfuserDecreased the health given per shot from 20 to 15Dev Note: The flat healing per second on stationary targets during a Cashout steal has been more impactful than we expected. This change will address that specific use case, while ensuring the H+ is still valuable. Healing EmitterCooldown now begins when the Emitter is destroyed, not on deploymentCooldown reduced from 35 seconds to 30 secondsEmitter can now be retrieved via the control tablet, setting its remaining cooldown to 15sEmitter can now be retrieved via a manual interaction, setting its remaining cooldown to 3sDev Note: The Healing Emitter was a bit too forgiving in its initial state where players could drop ...",1751537006,
2073850,Update 7.2,"Update 7.2.0 This week, we’ve been chasing server performance issues, and there is still more to solve. So far, we fixed an infrastructure issue where players would sometimes get higher ping than necessary. However, we know many of you are still experiencing problems that are hindering your game play. It’s the top priority and we have a strike team working hard to solve this issue. Thank you for your patience and for all the helpful posts and reports that have helped us with the investigation thus far.  In World Tour this week, VAIIYA welcomes you to play Protocol: XPOSE!

2073850,Hotfix 7.0.1,"Season 7 is off to a great start, but with just a few bumps along the way! Here we have a Hotfix (no update needed) to help smooth things out a bit. We intended to have NOZOMI/CITADEL cranked up to 11 in terms of map picks, but thanks to the community we found that that was not the case. This should be fixed, and you should now be fighting across the Rift much more frequently. We have temporarily disabled the new weapon system that went live for all automatic weapons yesterday after finding a couple issues with it. As hard as we try to test things, nothing beats thousands of players across hundreds of devices going hands on - thank you all so much for calling out the issues you found so we can act on them swiftly! We have loaded in your Seasonal rewards, including the ENGIMO prize given to everyone based on the results of the S6 Sponsor Showdown. We also delivered a small gift to honor the players of Season 1 who bought the very first Battle Pass, thank you for being here since the very beginning!  Content and Bug Fixes Battle PassFor the first few hours after launching the season, those who bought the Premium Battle Pass followed by the Ultimate Battle Pass, did not get their proper refund of 1150 Multibucks. The issue has been resolved, and your missing Multibucks have now been refundedCustomization Returned the missing items from the store. We had about ten bundles that were mysteriously yeeted from the store but now they are back! We have removed the Standard Show and Ditch and Switch weapon bundles, as the animations on the weapons were incorrectly shown. They will be back in Update 7.1 Dev Note: If you already bought it, don’t worry, you’ll have your properly working animation very soon! GadgetsGoo GunFixed an issue where goo blobs hitting players who were stealing a Cashout would not interrupt the steal interaction as intendedMapsNozomi/CitadelFixed an issue where Nozomi/Citadel was being selected from the map pool less often that it should be in some modesFixed an issue where Nozomi/Citadel was not being selected from the map pool at all in TDM modePerformance & StabilityFixed an issue causing game servers to occasionally crashUIFixed an issue where some circuit rewards were being displayed in the customization menu that were there too early and in some cases, were incorrect WeaponsGeneral Temporarily disabled the new weapon system that was being used by all automatic weapons, due to an issue where players could wrongly be placed into the ‘uncontrolled’ movement state, thus increasing weapon recoil and bullet dispersion Dev Note: For now, these weapons are back on the old weapon system. The new system will be turned on again in a future update, once we have a fix for the issue in question. A special thank you to the community members who quickly identified the issue and reported it, this allowed us to rapidly improve the new weapon system and combat as a whole. ",1749827144,

THE END OF ENDLESS EFFECTS We’ve finally tracked down and eradicated the root cause to one of the most persistent and annoying bugs in the game: a complicated but infuriatingly common series of events (only sometimes) could cause the cue states of effects to persist forever.

This issue caused all sorts of visual irritants to be “stuck” to players, like burning, Invincibility (just the visual state), Detection (AKA opponents constantly being tracked) and all the rest!

Gameplay-wise, we’re making targeted balance changes to two of the Arena’s most talked-about weapons. The CB-01 Repeater gets a boost to its environmental damage, making it far better at dealing with deployables and ziplines, while the Minigun receives a notable accuracy upgrade when focus-firing. We’re not touching the spin-up mechanic just yet, but it’s something we’re actively evaluating as the season progresses. Week 2 of Bunny Bash is also live now, with a new circuit of event contracts for you to complete for some amazing rewards! World Tour: Protocol Overdrive (Sponsored by ENGIMO) ENGIMO is redefining chaos - again. In Protocol Overdrive, gameshow events don’t just show up once per match - they hit back-to-back, dropping contestants into a relentless gauntlet of environmental hazards and alien mayhem. Expect short moments of calm between bursts of absolute madness, with Meteor Showers and Alien Invasions shaking up the mid-game and forcing players to adapt on the fly. There’s barely time to breathe before the next disaster hits. Arenas in rotation: SYS$HORIZON Bernal Kyoto Las Vegas Stadium Over in the store, we’ve got a wild lineup of new cosmetics ready to drop: Night Munchies Set “Carrots optional, casualties guaranteed.” Suit up in the Predator Payload outfit, complete with Assault Rabbit headgear and glowing Warren Glare eyes. Fluffy on the outside, ruthless on the inside. Arena Vision Set “For contestants who see every angle in THE FINALS.” Featuring the Sappy Ending skin for the Cerberus, Sledgehammer, and SR-84. Because every story should end with a bang. Opulent Heavy Bundle ""Devastating luxury, tailored for destruction."" Dominate the battlefield with Skullbound Oblivion skins for the Shak-50, Flamethrower, and M60 - dark, ominous, and absurdly stylish. Now, let’s check out the balance changes (with dev notes) in detail: Balance Changes Weapons CB-01 Repeater Increased environmental damage from 8 to 18 Dev Note: With the previous environmental damage value the Repeater had a tough time destroying ziplines. This change should help to address that. M134 Minigun Decreased bullet dispersion when standing still and ‘focus firing’ (secondary fire) by approximately 10%, making the weapon more accurate Decreased bullet dispersion when moving and focus firing by approximately 10%, making the weapon more accurate Dev Note: We really like that the spin-up time of the Minigun encourages players to adopt a different style of play to other weapons when using it, such as making use of various shields to protect while spinning up, or using Proximity Sensors to provide an early warning that gives time to spin-up. Because of this, despite some feedback that the Minigun is a little underpowered, we’re reluctant to address that by reducing the spin-up time and making the gun more responsive, as this risks it simply turning into another LMG. Instead, we’re making an adjustment to the weapon’s accuracy to make it slightly more effective at range. Performance wise, our data is showing the Minigun performing somewhere in the middle of the pack, so we’re reasonably happy with how it’s behaving. We do feel that ‘juggling’ and maintaining the spin-up state while moving is a little too easy right now, so it is our intent to review that and potentially change it later this season, as we do really want using the Minigun to commit players to being prepared in how they play, but it’s likely that if that change does go ahead, it will come with some other tweaks to offset that change. We’ll see exactly where we go with that as the season goes on. ",1744884150,

Pure Competition, Perfectly Broadcast, Perfectly Connected - just the way ENGIMO wants you to see it! On the gameplay side, Update 6.3 brings a nerf to the Sword’s secondary attack, aiming to reduce the frustration many players have felt when facing this very sharp stick. We’ve also rolled out a wide slate of bug fixes and improvements across UI, animations, performance, and more. Finally, Balance-wise, the meta’s looking more stable than it has in a while, but we’re still keeping a close eye on standout contenders like the Cerberus, Pike-556, FAMAS, and the Season 6 newcomers: M134, CB-01, and ARN-220. We’ve also got a stacked store rotation this week. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Nope, that’s a snuke! Now, let’s hop into the full patch notes below, before we hop into Bunny Bash! 🐣 Balance Changes Dev Note: This week's balance changes are fairly light as right now, the overall meta is looking more stable than it has for a while. We are monitoring several items based on their performance at present though and are likely to make some adjustments to them in the coming weeks. These include the Cerberus 12GA, Pike-556 and FAMAS, as well as each of the three new weapons, the M134 Minigun, CB-01 Repeater and the ARN-220. Additionally, we’re continuing to monitor the performance of the respawn system in Cashout mode and expect to have some refinements to make to the system in the 6.6 update. Weapons Sword Decreased secondary attack damage from 140 to 105 Dev Note: The Sword has increasingly become a source of frustration for a lot of players, especially Light players, who feel its ‘one-shot’ potential when combined with Quick Melee is too oppressive. Over time, we’ve been trying to reduce the potential for one-shots in a lot of places in the game and we feel it’s time to address that here. We believe the sudden rise in frustration with the Sword is also partially due to the removal of the Stun Gun, which was many Light players’ answer to a fast lunging Sword user in the past. This change removes the essentially one-shot potential of the Sword. Longer term, we’re going to continue to monitor the Sword and explore some alternative changes that might allow us to nudge the lunge damage back up, but that will take more time and we’d rather try to address this issue now than wait. We’ll also need to see how things change once the re-worked Stun Gun returns, which should be around 6.6. Additionally, there are several exploits and bugs we’ve become aware of related to performing extra or ‘phantom’ attacks, which we’re aiming to fix in the near future. Content and Bug Fixes Animation Fixed an issue on the standard reload for the AKM where the magazine was flicked in the wrong direction, it now flicks forwards as intended Fixed an animation issue where the Haptic Reload animation for .50 Akimbo looked broken from another player's perspective Fixed an animation issue where cancelling the Wild Draw inspect animation for the Throwing Knives by attacking looked broken from another player's perspective Added missing shell eject for the CB-01 Repeater lever action animation Updated the M26 Matter reload animations to move the reticle less when aiming down sights Fixed a rare issue where the upper body on the third person contestant could become out of proportion Fixed the recurve bow’s animation breaking when swapping to another item while the bow is char...",1744276668,

ALFA ACTA signs off their seasonal sponsorship with a new twist for Season 6: Head Hunter.

2073850,Store Rotation 6.2,"Store Rotation 6.2.0 The Arena’s getting a little more chaotic, and a whole lot more colorful, in this week’s store rotation! First up: the Mischief Maker Set. A masterclass in mischief, this ÖRF-themed outfit brings a full loadout of trickster energy, including the HumÖRFul Havoc weapon skins. It’s all style, all smirk, and just the right amount of trouble. On the fruitier side of things, the Ripe for Chaos Set turns the Arena into your personal fruit basket. These green, sticker-plastered Forbidden Fruit weapons may look adorable, but don’t be fooled, they’re too tempting to resist and just chaotic enough to get the job done.

2073850,Update 6.1,"Update 6.1 Update 6.1 - Bug Fixes, some balance and the First Stop on the Season 6 Tour Season 6 kicked off with a bang, and we’re keeping up the pace with our first update of the season packed with balance changes, bug fixes, and a bold new twist in World Tour. First up, Update 6.1 delivers a boost to the ARN-220, nudging up its damage to help it hit harder in the heat of battle. While it’s not a final solution, it gives us a better read on its place in the meta. As for the CB-01 Repeater and the M134 Minigun, we’ve seen plenty of mixed opinions, but the data shows they’re landing squarely in the middle for now. On top of that, we’ve tackled a series of bugs affecting outfits, weapons, and core gameplay, including one that could make your contestant invisible, and another that prevented players from shooting after respawning. There’s still work to do, and we’re tracking down any lingering issues. But that’s not all. This week also marks the next World Tour stop: Risk & Reward. In this twist, eliminations no longer have fixed payouts, instead, your cash earned depends on your weapon of choice. Play it safe with an AKM or M11 and earn just $200 per elimination, or go big with a Spear or M26 and rake in a cool $1000. It’s a high-risk, high-reward showdown which is perfect for testing your nerve and shaking up your strategy. Featured Arenas: Las Vegas Stadium Skyway Stadium Kyoto Fortune Stadium Thanks for being part of the chaos. We’re just getting started. Now, let’s dig into everything coming in Update 6.1! Balance Changes Weapons ARN-220 Increased damage from 15 to 17 Dev Note: The ARN has not performed as well as we initially expected since its release so this change is a small nudge to make it more effective. We’re not 100% sure this solves its effectiveness, but it should help while we dig further into the performance data and figure out how else we might want to improve it Dev Note: We’d also like to note that we’ve seen some mixed initial feedback on both the CB-01 and M134 Minigun, with feedback varying a lot from player to player. Right now, the performance data we have suggests both weapons are performing somewhat ‘in the middle of the pack’, and because of this we’re not going to rush out any changes to these weapons in 6.1. Instead, we’ll give them a little more time to settle into the meta and will then check again on how they’re performing once players have had more time to adapt to them. Content and Bug Fixes Characters & Customization Fixed an issue when current outfits created prior to Season 6 could get duplicated when the game was updated to Version 6.0. Dev Note: We still see that duplicates can appear after creating outfits inside the game, we have fixed one potential cause and will be on the look out for more. Fixed an issue where certain combinations of cosmetics could render them invisible Fixed an issue where the deletion of a created outfit could lead to unexpected results Fixed an issue where billboards showing off contestants would not have the correct outfit if it was changed in the lobby prior to the round starting Fixed the requirement for the Amethyst 'Cash Earned' player card badge as it was being handed out incorrectly. Dev Note: This means that if you were part of the players who got the badge while it was bugged, you will no longer have it Controller Fixed an issue where you could not navigate away from the “feedback sent” screen with a controller Game Play Fixed an issue where contestants were not able to shoot after respawning Dev Note: We believe that we have found and fixed one of the more common “can’t shoot bugs”. We are still hard at work fixing any remaining cases as we might not have caught them all just yet. Fixed an issue where sights attached to a weapon would get a faulty texture if combined with certain skins Fixed an issue where weapons could get offset in aim down sight, obscuring the screen Maps Practice Range Updated practice range trophy with S5 leaderboards Private Matches Cleaned up Game Mode Information screen to only show relevant information Cleaned up Lobby Creation screen to only show relevant fields Rendering Fix motion blur artifacts for some Intel and AMD GPUs Social Fixed support for anonymous and streamer mode in World Tour and Ranked Tournaments UI Fixed background images looking stretched in some screens Weapons M134 Minigun Fixed the missing aim assist when using a controller.

These changes should nudge it back to a better place. Recurve Bow Increased damage per shot, when the bow is at max draw, from 120 to 124. The base damage per shot remains at 60 damage Content and Bug Fixes Animation Fixed an issue where the Spear’s secondary animation wouldn’t play if activated right after using up all the charges of the previously equipped item Fixed an issue where the impact animation would continuously play after blocking a shot with the Riot Shield Cosmetics Victory Shade Set Now loops and overwrites colors continuously instead of stopping after 10 eliminations Fixed an issue where team colors wouldn’t update when changing colorblindness settings or toggling Use Enemy Color Concrete Smoke Model 1887 Skin Fixed an issue where the left hand would remain static in mid-air when playing the Prairie Twirl Deploy Animation Gameplay Fixed an issue that could cause objects to have collision and be invisible if they were destroyed and dematerialized during the same frame Fixed a bug where the wrong item would be equipped after getting glitched and the item would be unusable Fixed an issue where attempting to use a Weapon or Gadget immediately after swapping could activate the previously equipped item instead Fixed an issue where swapping to your Specialization would immediately switch back to your Weapon Fixed an issue where ADS would stop working Maps Kyoto Small Kyoto destruction tweak to enhance server performance Lowered bamboo stump heights when broken to help with traversal Fixed an issue where vaults could continuously fall through floor due to the inability to find a solid surface to rest on Bernal Updated the thickness of cinder block walls for smoother traversal Fortune Stadium Adjusted collision on beams in the Mall to prevent players from getting stuck in wedge-shaped collisions Practice Range Fixed an issue where the trophies were incorrectly labeled Fixed an issue where all bots could incorrectly appear as friendlies or enemies Skyway Stadium Fixed an issue where players could walk on invisible collision underneath the ground in the Hotels area Las Vegas Slightly adjusted the jump pad and a player spawn between Glamora and Eastwood casinos for improved flow Performance & Stability Fixed a rare crash in the animation system Added support for AMD Anti-Lag 2 Improved performance for players experiencing issues due to large friend lists Rendering Enhanced high and epic-quality reflections in game intro sequences Fixed an issue where an unintended post-process effect could sometimes appear on player cards Settings Added a ""No AA"" resolution scaling option that completely disables anti-aliasing and temporal resolution scaling Fixed an issue where certain video options, including 120Hz mode, would reset to default on Xbox after restarting the game Fixed an issue where certain input devices or buttons could cause duplicated inputs, preventing players from equipping their specialization by triggering the swap function twice Security and Anti-cheat Improved detections Store In addition to this week's store rotation, we’ve added a .50 Akimbo skin, Monochrome Edge, to the customization menu UI Fixed a rare issue where squad members would sometimes not appear in the bottom-left widget and scoreboard during a match",1741255319,

2073850,Update 5.10.0 is Live!,"Update 5.10.0 Balance changes and an AMA In this update, the Stun Gun has been temporarily removed as we begin a full rework to refine its role as a true crowd control tool. This change is aimed at improving gameplay balance, especially for new players. Check the attached dev note for more details! Also of note, we’ve been closely investigating server performance for some time, recognizing that it hasn’t been meeting expectations. After thorough analysis, we believe we’ve identified a key issue, and this fix should significantly improve the experience for a large number of players. That said, our work isn’t done. We’re committed to making ongoing improvements and will continue rolling out fixes as we identify further opportunities for optimization. Thank you for your feedback and reports, community input has been invaluable in helping us refine the experience. Please keep sharing your observations, and let us know if you experience a difference after this update. Join Our AMA! If you’re looking for real-time interaction with the devs, we’ll be hosting an AMA over on r/thefinals tonight, where some of our directors will be answering your burning questions. Drop by live or post your questions now and check back later to see if you got an answer! You can submit your questions already right here. And of course, this update comes with fresh new items in the store. Go check them out! Balance Changes Gadgets Breach Charge Decreased priming time from 1.9s to 1.5s Dev Note: With the change to three ammo, the Charge's priming time now feels a bit slow for its projectile count. This adjustment aims to improve that. Frag Grenade Decreased ammo from 2 to 1 Decreased damage from 150 to 140 Increased environmental damage from 600 to 900 Dev Note: Frag Grenades have been outperforming the RPG-7 in damage, ammo, and cooldown, which isn’t ideal. We also recognize that grenades can be a pain point for players. These adjustments aim to bring grenades more in line with other explosives while slightly buffing their impact on the environment. Additionally, our goal is to increase the readability of grenades in the future, which should help alleviate some of the frustration. When that update arrives, we’ll revisit these changes and make any necessary adjustments. Stun Gun Temporarily disabled the Stun Gun’, pending a re-work that will release some time during season 6 Dev Note: The Stun Gun has long been a major pain point for players. Despite multiple adjustments, it remains overly punishing for those on the receiving end. The gadget was always intended to be primarily for crowd control. However, it instead functions too often as a tool to secure a kill, leaving little room for counterplay. This is especially problematic for new players, as early encounters with the Stun Gun can be frustrating enough to impact their experience and desire to continue playing. To keep the game engaging and fair for all, we need to fix this. After careful evaluation, we’ve made the call to fully rework the Stun Gun. Our goal is to refine its mechanics, visuals, and overall clarity so that when encountered in the Arena, its role is clear, fair, and impactful. To do this properly, we’re temporarily removing the Stun Gun while we work on delivering a better version that matches our vision. All progression, skins and unlocks will carry over to the new version of the Stun Gun when it returns. For now, the gadget will be unavailable while we build a true crowd control tool that benefits the whole team and enables clutch plays, without the frustrations that held it back. We hope to be able to put an improved Stun Gun back into your hands as soon as possible. Weapons General We’ve improved animation timing so that manual actions (such as lever-action or pump-action sequences) now play more quickly after a quick melee attack, reducing dead time between actions. The impact of this change varies depending on the weapon’s specific animation set Dev Note: Our fix for the manual action cancel exploit unintentionally made these weapons feel less responsive. This update should help improve that. We’re still reviewing manual actions and looking for ways to make them smoother while keeping them balanced. Content and Bug Fixes Animation Fixed a rare case where contestants would be stuck in a T-pose when emoting Audio Added headshot elimination sound Characters We've updated the hand model to a new, improved version that looks significantly more realistic and detailed, enhancing the overall immersion Controller Fixed an issue where controller navigation would stop working in the main menu for party members who were not the party leader Fixed an issue where controller navigation was broken in the Recently Played With tab Cosmetics Fixed hairstyle compatibility with the following cosmetics Cabalgata Bolero Ballad Brim Headwear Multi-Mood Mask Gameplay Fixed an issue where destroying certain friendly gadgets incorrectly granted combat score Resolved issues preventing item...",1739959640,
2073850,Update 5.9.0,"This week, we have a store update and a special message about balance changes and our new goal. Make sure to check it out below, along with a few tweaks to weapons in this update! Balance Changes We want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the recent frustrations around the frequency of balance changes. At the end of Season 3, we adjusted our balance cadence from a demanding weekly schedule to a more structured approach, aligning the majority of balance changes with the start and middle of each season. Our goal was to create a more stable experience for players while also giving our dev team the time needed to properly assess and test changes before making adjustments. That said, the current pace feels a bit too slow, and we understand how a lack of iteration has been frustrating. Starting with Season 6, we’re shifting to a roughly 3-week balance update schedule. This should create a better experience for both players and our dev team, allowing for more consistent refinements. Major balance shifts will still happen at the start of each season, but balance tweaks will now be more frequent throughout. Expect smaller, more frequent updates for the rest of Season 5 as we transition to this new approach. We appreciate your patience and feedback, it helps us continue improving the game for everyone. With that, let’s get a head start with a few small changes in this update: Weapons Dagger Decreased the backstab angle on the Dagger’s secondary attack from 180 degrees to 150 Dev Note: This change addresses concerns about the Dagger's backstab being inaccurate and the frustration around how easily it can land backstabs, seemingly from the side. With this change, this should be less of an issue. On a related note, we've noticed some community members testing melee mechanics in the Practice Range using target dummies. However, these dummies use slightly different hit detection logic compared to real players, making them an unreliable test for certain interactions. For example, we've seen reports of players landing melee hits on dummies while facing away from them. This is a quirk of the dummies and does not apply to actual players. To improve testing accuracy, we plan to replace the current target dummies with updated versions soon. This will ensure that the dummies provide more reliable feedback, especially for testing certain Gadgets. However, this change will take some time and testing before it is ready to deploy. KS-23 Increased min damage falloff multiplier from 0.6 to 0.7, meaning the weapon now does slightly more damage at long-range Decreased bullet dispersion when aiming down sights to increase accuracy in the majority of different stances (such as crouching, running, etc.) Dev Note: The KS-23 has been struggling after the recent fixes to ‘manual actions’ in Update 5.8. We recognize that these changes had an unintended negative impact on its performance, and we want to make sure it feels more viable in gameplay. With this update, we’re making some adjustments to help the KS-23 get back on track. This isn’t the last step; we’ll continue monitoring its performance and exploring additional ways to improve if needed. ",1739357559,['patchnotes']

Balance Changes Gadgets Breach Charge Decreased the delay between throwing multiple Breach Charges from 0.9s to 0.6s Lockbolt Launcher Re-enabled the ability for the Lockbolt to attach to objectives Increased activation grace period from 0.8s to 1s, making it slightly easier to lock on to targets Decreased the minimum pull distance from 8m to 6m, giving locked players slightly less room to maneuver Decreased the maximum pull distance from 10m to 6m, giving locked players less room to maneuver Increased the pull force of the Lockbolt by 50%, making it slightly harder for players to move beyond the radius of the lock’s chains Increased the damage the Lockbolt applies to targets from 0 to 5 Added functionality that will disable the Lockbolt’s tethers if the Lockbolt is carried through a Gateway that is outside the maximum pull distance (6m) Game Modes Dev Note: Since our changes to deposit values in Cashout in Season 3, we’ve noticed an increasing number of teams adopting the ‘plug meta,’ where teams primarily focus on depositing Cash Boxes in World Tour and Ranked Tournaments to increase their chances of winning. While we wanted to encourage teams to focus on depositing and protecting cashouts, rather than third-partying already active cashouts, the ‘plug meta’ has become a little too common and leads to a bad teamplay experience. The changes to team wipes and deposit values, listed below, aim to nudge teams away from focusing entirely on plugging, while still reducing the incentives for third-partying. Cashout Decreased the percentage of cash in a Cashbox that is awarded for depositing it at the Cashout Station from ~30% to ~20% Increased the percentage of cash in a Cashbox that is awarded for completing a cashout from ~70% to ~80% of the Cashbox’s value Ranked Tournament (Cashout) Increased the amount of cash lost from a team’s total for a team wipe from 10% to 15% Specializations Charge N’ Slam Decreased the damage done by the initial impact on enemies from 130 to 100 Decreased the damage done by subsequent hits on enemies from 50 to 40 Decreased the minimum damage of the ground slam, based on fall height from 80 to 50 Dev Note: The damage applied by Charge N’ Slam has been quite high for some time and is especially punishing for Light players, especially when repeatedly hit by the charge. We feel these new values offer a fairer experience Dematerializer Decreased the duration of dematerialized objects from 30s to 15s, causing objects to rematerialize sooner Added the ability for the Dematerializer to remove props attached to wall segments Dev Note: This change should mean that the Dematerializer now makes clearer holes in the environment that are easier to move through Guardian Turret Decreased the cooldown from 8s to 3s when manually picking up the Guardian Turret Winch Claw Decreased the range of the Winch Claw from 12m to 10m Weapons Cerberus Increased damage from 9 to...",1738749300,

As a result, we’re temporarily disabling the Lockbolt’s ability to latch on to objectives, while we spend some time to make sure they behave more appropriately when attached.

This isn’t just another season—it’s a celebration of an unforgettable year since THE FINALS launched! Over four thrilling seasons, we’ve redefined competition in the ultimate game show. Now, it’s time for the Next Stage. Season 4 honored our amazing community by bringing back the thrill of Ranked Tournaments, unveiling the vibrant Fortune Stadium, and amplifying everything that makes THE FINALS extraordinary. But this new season isn’t just about looking back, it’s about blazing forward with exciting surprises, groundbreaking features, and a breathtaking new arena. Get ready to dive into Season 5, the most exhilarating chapter of THE FINALS yet! LA MAGIA DE BERNAL As you explore what this season has to offer, your first stop has got to be Bernal, the sprawling new map! Set beneath the imposing Peña de Bernal, one of the largest monoliths in the world, this vibrant town captures the magic and historic charm of Mexico while unleashing the high-octane action of THE FINALS. This map pulses with energy, inviting you to join in rooftop skirmishes, defend suspended sponsor structures, and conquer the spinning platform that transforms the vibrant colonial plaza into a grand Arena of legendary proportions. Each corner teems with opportunity, offering a stage where the daring and the bold can carve their path to glory. Game-Changing Firepower: New Weapons in Season 5 Season 5 raises the stakes with two powerful additions to your arsenal, each designed to reshape the battlefield and your strategies. Prepare to dominate with these innovative tools of destruction: ShAK-50: This heavy-hitting assault rifle is a force to be reckoned with! Tailored for the Heavy class, it fires two bullets per shot. Whether you’re holding down a defensive position or charging headfirst into the fray, this weapon packs a punch that demands respect. Cerberus 12GA: For the Medium class, the Cerberus 12GA is a triple-barrel, break-action shotgun that brings the heat…literally. Equipped with incendiary shells, this weapon doesn’t just devastate opponents, it also ignites the environment, creating chaos in its wake. Use it to eliminate your enemies, or simply watch the Arena burn as you claim victory. Whether you prefer precision or pyrotechnics, these tools ensure no moment in the Arena is ever dull. Innovative New Gadgets in Season 5 We’ve also introduced two groundbreaking gadgets that redefine how you control the battlefield. Gravity Vortex: Designed for the Light class, this deployable gadget with a remote trigger unleashes the power of a localized singularity. When activated, the Gravity Vortex pulls everything in its vicinity toward its core: objectives, players, and debris. Use it to disrupt enemy plans, create chaos, or take control of contested areas with a single well-placed trap. Lockbolt Launcher: Built for the Heavy class, the Lockbolt Launcher fires an anchor that latches onto the environment and ensnares up to three targets at once. Affected players’ mobility is severely limited, giving you the chance to capitalize on their vulnerability. Whether you’re locking down key locations or setting up for the perfect takedown, this gadget turns control into your strongest weapon. These tools are designed to give you the upper hand, whether through clever tactics or sheer domination. New Sights & Reduced Visual Recoil: With the release of Season 5 more items will be able to equip alternative sights. Additionally, we’ve significantly reduced the amount of Visual Recoil experienced when aiming-down-sights, causing the bullets to land closer to where your reticle indicates. The following weapons will be receiving sights in S5: M26 Matter Cerberus 12GA ShAK-50 93R Lewis Gun Model 1887 LH1 New Season, New Sponsors: Who Will You Choose?

2073850,Update 4.6.0,"Update 4.6.0 Mid-way through Season 4 It’s halftime in The Arena and we bid our second sponsor, HOLTOW, farewell and Thank You for the generous sponsorship this season! ISEUL-T are next in line and have some big shoes to fill following last week’s Trick or Treat event in the World Tour - but if anyone can do it, and in a grandiose fashion, it’s ISEUL-T. Don't forget to keep spinning the wheel! Ticket drops end on the 13th but the event will stay live until the 15th, giving you time to spend your tickets and pick up a few last items in peace. Good luck! This week we are bringing you some balance changes, reducing the effective range of both the Healing Beam and the Sword, while adjusting the Pike-556 to have a clearer ranged identity. There’s also a boatload of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements coming your way, with everything from a fix for beards clipping through headwear to some much-needed performance improvements for XBOX. Worried about what to do when the sun goes dark? Thanks to this week’s store update, and HOLTOW’s generous Insurance Set - you don’t need to worry. Check it out here: Now, let’s dig into the changes! Balance Changes Gadgets Healing Beam Decreased max target distance from 12m to 10m Decreased max healing distance from 15m to 13m Decreased time before we disconnect a blocked healing beam, from 1s to 0.75s Dev Note: We felt the existing range of the Healing Beam was causing teams to benefit from healing in combat, without the associated risks of close proximity. We feel with this closer range we open up more opportunities to counter-play teams that are healing in combat, via various Gadgets. Wherever we can, we prefer to try and solve possible balance issues via counter-play, rather than straight-up nerfs, and we think this change should offer opportunities here, but as always we’ll monitor the impact of the change and adjust as needed. Pike-556 Decreased damage from 52 to 47 Increased damage falloff multiplier at max range from 75% to 85%, increasing the damage at longer ranges Dev Note: We felt the Pike-556 still remained too strong in close-range encounters despite the previous damage adjustments. With these changes we make the weapon less effective at closer ranges while maintaining its effectiveness at longer ranges Pyro Grenade Pyro Grenades will now deal damage to shields, such as the Dome Shield and Mesh Shield Sword Decreased lunge duration of the secondary attack from 0.4 to 0.3 seconds, resulting in ~1m reduction in distance, from roughly 7m to 6m Decreased the length of the secondary attack’s hit sweep by 55cm Dev Note: These changes should decrease the effective range of the lunge attack by ~1.5m, hopefully making the Sword slightly less oppressive for players facing it. Content and Bug Fixes Animation Updated player card pose for the ‘Tripwire Tango’ Emote Fixed an issue where the Winch Claw animation would not play when firing the main weapon Fixed an issue with the Throwing Knives where the player’s arms could end up in a locked state after using the secondary attack Made adjustments to how the sprint animations are triggered for the .50 Akimbo pistols. Previously when continuously pressing the assigned sprint button, animations would retrigger making the experience feel a bit clumsy. This should now feel smoother Fixed an issue where you could enter a faulty movement state when detaching from a broken ladder in the practice range Audio Fixed an issue that could cause the commentators to mention it was the first team wipe when the second team wipe of a match happened Fixed an issue where the Treat Hunt introduction video had the wrong audio file and incorrect subtitles Added more line variations when new vaults spawn, 1 minute left and 30 seconds left Improved delivery on June’s respawn lines Contracts Players can no longer progress healing-based Contracts by restoring teammates’ health that was lost due to self-damage. Only healing damage caused by enemy players will count Players can now only progress revive-based Contracts by reviving teammates that were eliminated by opposing players. Reviving players who eliminated themselves will not be counted Fixed an issue where kills caused by throwables were not granting combat score Customization Fixed an issue where beards would clip through some helmets Made the Tacticool charm heavier, to prevent erratic movement Added a leaderboard to the ÖRF backpack in-game (visible on the backpack!) Fixed an issue where sometimes the wrong watch was displayed Fixed an issue that caused many headwear items to not be displayed on characters at a distance Fixed an issue where certain headwear would not fully dissolve when a contestant was eliminated Fixed an issue that caused emote sound effects to be played when editing player cards Improved the experience of equipping player card items in store bundles Fixed an issue that caused some weapon skins to load incorrectly, glitch in the game, or not load at all on Xbox Game Modes Fixe...",1730889167,

2073850,Update 4.5.0,"Update 4.5.0 Halloween is here! We’ve got an all-new event with 27 collectible rewards and an explosive addition to the World Tour maps starting tomorrow, sponsored by HOLTOW, who reminds you to carve your pumpkins with extreme caution! For today… Join the Treat Hunt Collection Event Feeling dizzy, Contestant? It might be the copious amounts of OSPUZE-flavored Halloween candy you’ve been eating, or it could be our brand new feature - the Wheel! The Reward Wheel is something we’ve never seen before in THE FINALS! We realized that we could not be the World's greatest game show without a flashy wheel of amazing prizes! This Halloween, instead of adding all of these amazing cosmetics to the store, we’ve added them to the Reward Wheel. In order to spin the wheel and win something, you must have a ticket, and you can earn up to three tickets per day by completing daily contracts! There’s an equal chance of winning every item, and if there’s a specific item you want from the wheel you can buy it using either VR’s or Multibucks (depending on the item) - no luck needed! If you spend a ticket on a spin and wind up on a reward you already have, you’ll get some VR’s back - so every spin is a win! If you collect all the rewards featured on the wheel, you’ll get the grand prize: the Stealth Specter Bundle, which is sure to make you stand out in The Arena! The event goes live right now, and will be live for two full weeks - so make sure you hop in right now, work your way through those contracts, and… SPIN. THAT. WHEEL! Do you know what makes this Halloween event extra scary? We’ve never done anything like this before. We want to keep finding new ways to reward and amuse you while keeping the game new and fun! Because this is so new, we would love your feedback on this event. So when it’s over, we’ll ask you to fill out a short survey about your experience. In this update, the store is Spookier than ever! If you’re still unsure about what to dress up as for Halloween the Seas The Day bundle has you covered, it even comes with a pirate’s booty worth of Multibucks! For those of you fighting for the top 500, this week, we are introducing Ruby level to the leaderboards! Check out this week’s balance changes and a longer dev note on how we approach balance changes this season: Balance Changes A note on balance changes– Our approach to balancing the game has evolved since the first season of THE FINALS! In the beginning, we made a lot of changes because the game was brand new and we suddenly had a constant flow of players to provide feedback, telemetry, and information that we could use to quickly calibrate and experiment with. As time marches on and we start to see this game reach a more stable state, we want to fall into a more sustainable and reliable rhythm that gives us time to plan larger and more meaningful shifts in balance based on how we see the community engage with the meta. As such, our intent is to do those larger, meta-altering balance passes at the start of each new season, where we can introduce new strategies and ways to play. Then, as needed, we’ll perform another pass halfway through each season aimed at polishing the current meta and addressing major feedback points from our core without fully resetting the meta and causing confusion. Between these two major balance passes, we’ll only perform smaller nudges to the balance that aim to smooth out the current experience when absolutely necessary. We’re hopeful this approach will lead to a smoother and clearer experience for you and help set better expectations regarding the weekly game updates while being kinder to our players and to our team! Weapons Model 1887 Increased inner pellet radius from 0.45 to 0.65, making the weapon less accurate at longer ranges Increased outer pellet radius from 1.3 to 1.7, making the weapon less accurate at longer ranges Decreased damage falloff multiplier from 65% to 60%, causing the weapon to do less damage at range Dev Note: One way we investigate the balance of weapons is to look at effectiveness in gameplay (i.e. stats like damage, kill rates, headshot rates, and accuracy), in addition to stats like usage and win rates. Looking at this data alone, the Model 1887 is good but not exceptional when it comes to effectiveness during play. However, we’ve seen a large uptick in usage, mostly in higher-skill tiers which has led to the gun being very prevalent in matches and leading to a somewhat stale meta. This ‘nudge’ to the effective range will hopefully disrupt this trend, without making the weapon weaker than its nearest competitors when it comes to effectiveness (i.e. the AKM, Famas and Pike-556). XP-54 Increased damage falloff start distance from 15m to 20m, making the weapon more impactful at range Increased damage falloff end distance from 25m to 30m, making the weapon more impactful at range Decreased damage falloff multiplier from 65% to 62% Content and Bug Fixes Contracts Added new Halloween Contracts as part of the Trea...",1730284077,

2073850,Update 4.4.0,"Update 4.4.0 It’s getting spooky in The Arena! With Halloween taking the spotlight next week, you might start seeing spooky changes around the Arena starting today! Dress up in your most ghoulish get-up, send shivers down enemy contestants' virtual spines as an Underworld Outcast, and get trick-or-treating before the season ends! In this patch, you’ll find changes and fixes, including the introduction of a system to reward kills to players based on environmental kills that launch players off the map, among other things! Check out the changes below and stay tuned for a World Tour update tomorrow that is out of this world, setting a spooky stage for things to come, and a new set of Twitch Drops to collect as we creep closer to Fright Night! Balance Changes Weapons Sledgehammer Decreased the sweep duration of the secondary attack by 25% Decreased the sweep width of the secondary attack from 30cm to 25cm Increased the sweep width of the primary attack from 12cm to 15cm Dev Note: These changes make the Sledgehammer’s hit sweeps more accurately match the attack animations which hopefully makes the weapon feel more reliable for its victims. We noticed that in some cases players would be hit despite the Sledgehammer’s model not passing near to them at all, which could cause a lot of confusion. Content and Bug Fixes Animation Fixed an issue where audio was looping when vaulting over certain obstacles Audio Replaced the Cl 40 grenade impact sound to lessen ear fatigue Bugs Fixed an issue that caused a hang for players using DX11 Fixed an issue where certain usage of goo could result in players bypassing collision Potential fix for players becoming permanently invisible during a round Fixed one of the issues which could cause destruction to appear out of sync Cosmetics Fixed an issue where the ""Stuck on you"" sticker on FCAR skin could be floating when using the Ironsight Contracts Re-balanced some of the distance-based Contracts to make achieving them a better experience Environmental Eliminations Updated the kill system to detect and reward players for ‘environmental kills’, i.e. kills where a player falls out of bounds and dies due to the actions of another player Examples of the types of falling kills this system can now detect include: Removing the floor from underneath a player (e.g. destroying Seoul’s sky bridge or removing it via the Dematerializer) Blocking a player with Goo or a thrown carriables Destroying ziplines carrying a player Firing a player out of the level with a Jump Pad Lifting a player out of the level with the Anti-Gravity Cube Pulling a player out of the level with the Winch Claw Knocking a player out of the level with Charge ‘n Slam Causing a player to fall out of the level using the Gateway Dev Note: This is the first iteration of this system. There's quite a few knobs to turn since there's a huge amount of ways in which players can end up falling out of bounds. We can't track absolutely all types of interactions due to the infinite amount of possibilities, including exceptions such as physics-to-physics interactions (i.e. objects/building pieces pushing at each other), but we've tried to catch most of the common ones. We'll keep on iterating and try to address as much of the feedback as possible in coming releases! Gadgets Anti-Gravity Cube Fixed various unintended bugs with the Anti-Gravity Cube Dev Notes: Unfortunately folks, with these fixes the age of the “Goo plane” is over. We loved your imagination with these creations, but this is not a form of locomotion we ever intended for the game and, as well as being very counterintuitive for many players, they can also negatively impact pacing. Glitch Trap Added squad colors to the Glitch Trap RPG-7 Fixed an issue where the RPG would restock ammo too early in the reload animation Game Modes Practice Range Fixed an issue where practice dummies would block explosive damage Maps Monaco Added additional exit point at the top of the alley zipline, allowing players to jump directly on the opposite rooftop. Kyoto Small flow improvements around the side of the Pavilion, preventing players from getting stuck between bamboos or get snagged on lanterns Settings Added a new option called ""Resolution Scale Mode"" when TAAU is the selected resolution scaling method. This new setting defaults to the ""Auto"" option, which selects resolution scaling automatically based on your screen resolution. The alternative ""Manual"" option allows adjusting the resolution scale value with the ""Resolution Scale"" slider, just like before Adjusted the way the GPUs FSR2 and XeSS are selected by default. Both of these are high-quality techniques that are not suitable for low-end GPUs. For low-end GPUs, TAAU will be the default resolution scaling method from now on Specializations Goo Gun Goo projectiles from the Goo Gun will now stick to the base of turrets in the same way as goo from barrels UI Fixed an issue where players moving from Platinum 1 to Diamond 4 in World Tour would s...",1729685342,

2073850,Update 4.2.0,"Welcome to Update 4.2! This update comes jam-packed with changes, from a brand new event in the World Tour, ranked rewards, a brand new community event and balance changes! First, let’s check out this week’s store update: World Tour Event - Primetime Buff Let’s jump into this week’s changes and start it off with a brand new event in the World Tour; “Primetime Buff”! Primetime Buff triggers when you or a teammate inserts a cash box into a cashout station, and it affects your whole team! When affected by Primetime Buff, you and your teammates receive +100 health over your typical max health (e.g. a Light player would go from a max of 150 to 250 health). Some notes about Primetime Buff; If taking damage, the extra health does not replenish. When the cashout is finished, the buff will disappear. The buff cannot be stacked, but it can be replenished if your team deposits another cash box. The buff does not apply to teammates that are eliminated when the cash box is inserted. ENGIMO are truly treating us well on their last stop of the World Tour, which includes the following maps; Fortune Stadium Monaco Kyoto SYS$HORIZON Season 3 Ranked Rewards We said we'd deliver the post-Season 3 rewards with update 4.2, and we still intend to do that. However, given how important it is that this is handled correctly, we still want to do further testing before handing them out. We are actively working on dotting the last i’s and crossing the final t’s before we can push the button to hand out the rewards, and our ambition is that this will still happen during update 4.2. Make sure to stay tuned on our Discord server https://www.discord.gg/thefinals and on our website for more information about when the rewards are paid out. Community Event! Lastly we’re introducing the first Community Event of Season 4! For this event we’re challenging all of you to eliminate 10.000.000 (TEN MILLION!) enemy contestants using the brand new weapons introduced in Season 4, before the time runs out. If you succeed, you’ll all be rewarded with the ENGIMO community-compliant .50 Akimbo’s! We’ll be monitoring your progress closely, best of luck contestants! Now, let’s get into the Balance Changes and Fixes of this update: Balance Changes Gadgets Data Reshaper Added Glitch Barrels to the rotation of reshaped items the Data Reshaper can create Smoke Grenade Increased ‘smoke entity duration’ from 15s to 17.5s. This means enemy health bars and outlines will not show through the smoke until the effect properly begins to disappear Game Modes Ranked Tournaments Updated the spawn point selection logic in the final round of the tournament, for teams who get wiped. This should reduce the number of long-distance spawns that occur Increased the variety of Cashout spawn locations when spawning the next objectives World Tour Updated the spawn point selection logic in the final round of the tournament, for teams who get wiped. This should reduce the number of long-distance spawns that occur Increased the variety of Cashout spawn locations when spawning the next objectives Specializations Mesh Shield Decreased Mesh Shield cooldown from 12s to 8s if the shield is damaged when closed Decreased Mesh Shield cooldown from 8s to 4s if the shield is undamaged when closed Dev Note: We’re still keen to avoid Mesh Shield ‘juggling’ in combat as that is not an intended playstyle for this Specialization, but we feel our changes made in 4.0 have been overly severe. These changes hopefully make the Mesh Shield more usable in 4.2 Weapons CL-40 Decreased damage from 117 to 100 Increased ammo from 4 to 5 Increased self-damage multiplier from 0.75 to 1.6 Updated damage fall-off curve so that damage drops to 90% at the edge of the 30cm inner radius, with damage falling off linearly from that point to 0 at the outer edge of the blast radius Dev Note: We felt our buff of the CL-40 in 4.0 was too much and made the weapon very oppressive in certain combos or when stacked. We’ve now dialed the damage back to a level closer to what we had before 4.0, while retaining the increased size of the max damage inner radius. To prevent the weapon from returning to a time where it took 100% accuracy to take down a Heavy, we’ve given it one additional ammo. As always, we’ll continue to monitor the impacts of this change and adjust further if needed Pike-556 Decreased damage from 59 to 52 Dev Note: On reviewing data it’s become apparent that the Pike was fairly overturned in our 4.0 release and this adjustment is intended to move it to a more reasonable place. We suspect it may still be too effective in too many different use cases, so we’ll continue to review the impact of this change and adjust in later patches if we feel more balancing is needed. V9S Decreased fire rate from 430 RPM to 360 RPM Increased damage from 37 to 40 Dev Note: These changes have been made to prevent various methods where players could ensure they got the effective maximum fire rate from the weapon through use of specific bind...",1728550365,
