578080,ENTERING ERANGEL: SUBZERO - The Cold is Coming,"Erangel: Subzero …Everything began with a twisted ambition to turn the Battlegrounds into something far more unforgiving. During a clandestine experiment, a catastrophic failure sent multiple Tythonic Satellites crashing down onto Erangel. The impact ruptured the Satellites and released cryogenic gas, which soon spread across the island. The Blue Zone was not spared from its influence, and Erangel’s climate began to warp under the growing chill. The crash sites froze over, and the island soon found itself gripped by sudden, severe changes in weather. Now, you must fight to survive in Erangel’s frigid and treacherous landscape—and remember that this marks only the beginning of a long and unforgiving winter.. Area Modifications Several areas across Erangel have changed following Satellite crashes. Stalber Stalber, where magnetic field experiments were being conducted, has frozen over due to the cryogenic gas leaking from the crashed Satellite. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/e39fcea017ee0611489fb494c9c0ef4902b72c93.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/74feb59904d5b265d8f8ecd52cc9975a7aa379d1.jpg Shelter Shelter, once a hidden storage site for the Tythonic Satellites, now stands among the places where those Satellites have crashed back to earth. Rumor has it some of them hold valuable loot. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/a810058e82efbaf56838146e59e99abedcc14484.jpg Sosnovka Military Base & Boatyard These two areas have also undergone drastic changes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/b684c29ca130e639462080209866e31c43c8c6f7.jpg Other Areas {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/6d5414e62395af2379d79c3d58619e5a8110fab1.jpg The bridge leading to Sosnovka Military Base has partially collapsed following a Satellite crash. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/f07757f7138bd39081ce61c62e097e3a0f83f02b.jpg The southwestern plain of Erangel has also seen major changes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/4c54f174fc522818b87381746f754bb6b53ccb47.jpg Wreckage from crashed Satellites can be found in certain areas. Several rivers have frozen over due to the sharp drop in temperature. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/014edc3266721d8494ebebeb1ac0f268f89493c2.jpg Snow piling up across Erangel has also altered parts of the terrain. Blue Zone ※ The following changes apply to all modes except Team Deathmatch. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/cdcbfe567c49a363b1f5ffaa374dcd9744f49bcc.jpg A freezing effect has been added. The damage, speed, and radius of the Blue Zone remain unchanged. New visual and sound effects have been added, varying by the level of Blue Zone damage. The freezing effect is not blocked by the Jammer Pack. The above changes also apply to both the BZ Grenade and the BZ Grenade Launcher. BZ Grenade A freezing effect has been added to the Blue Zone sphere generated upon throwing. This effect functions the same way as that of the Blue Zone. New Weapon: BZ Grenade Launcher Introducing a single-shot, break-open launcher found only in Erangel: Subzero. Use the BZ Grenade Launcher to pressure enemies or block their vision! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/fe4537f157806e32411ac1f9cf76436f6e163a55.jpg Inventory slot: Secondary Weapons Ammo: 40mm BZ Grenade Ammo weight: 20 When attached to a surface such as an object, the ground, wall, or roof, a Blue Zone sphere with a 7.5 m radius is created after a short delay. The sphere is less powerful than the one created by the BZ Grenade, dealing 8 damage per second. A warning sound plays before the sphere is generated. Does not activate when landing on water. 2-3 rounds spawn together with the BZ Grenade Launcher. Spawns in the World, Secret Rooms, and from Satellites. Weather Experience completely different weather conditions caused by the climate change. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/0d8ba05b2ebcb2294a852b48dcc3d535b1765543.jpg A faint chill can be felt in the air, though the skies remain clear for now. Applies to Arcade only. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/5f17276af60930b27d85f0273672ff125f400d77.jpg Snowflakes begin to fall, gradually covering the ground. With the Dynamic Weather feature enabled, changing winter conditions unfold across the Battlegrounds. Applies to Normal Match, Ranked, and Custom Match. Spawn Changes The Vikendi Ghillie Suit now spawns in Secret Rooms, Care Packages, and special airdrops. The world spawn rate of the M79 has been increased. The world spawn rates of the P1911, P92, and R1895 have been slightly reduced.

Miscellaneous Due to the aftermath of the Satellite crash, the Red Zone has been disabled. The rivers and sea have frozen, temporarily suspending ferry operations. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/27971017/7f39af53e16b2d4a9bd936ddf58b5ee937666ae8.jpg Airplanes operating over Erangel have received visual changes.
