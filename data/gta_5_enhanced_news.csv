3240220,GTA Online: Money Fronts,"Channel new revenue streams of clean and dirty income through iconic local businesses in Money Fronts, today’s new update in GTA Online. From the frenzied clubs of Tony Prince to El Rubio’s narcotrafficking empire, the power of Epsilon to the gold-tinted hijinks of Yusuf Amir — they’re all sustained by one thing: dirty filthy money. And you’ve just been summoned by the man who oversees it all. The head of San Andreas’ biggest money laundering network of shadowy financiers — the elusive Mr. Faber — has heard about you. And with the help of Martin Madrazo and Faber's fashionable fixer, Raf De Angelis, it's time for you two to form a mutually beneficial connection. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45517848/370cb951b935d402ca4b28485c3841769d3e0d9d.jpg GET HANDS ON Start scrubbing your criminal network’s bottom line at the Hands On Car Wash, the perfect above-board establishment to run cover for a criminal conspiracy. Dirty money flows in from all manner of back channels as you disrupt and destroy rival operations, bolster earnings from your already established unlawful endeavors, and watch the squeaky-clean cash flow out. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45517848/1ea89e2776ded3a9fea8ecde12e73707d4faf519.jpg SMOKE ON THE WATER Once you purchase the Hands On Car Wash, you can also expand your portfolio to include Smoke on the Water. Owning Vespucci Beach’s premier stash spot allows you to launder more money and run interference on rival grow operations. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45517848/ee3970920f5fd888c9af77f06e499d2ad8c631d7.jpg HIGGINS HELITOURS Owning the Hands On Car Wash also opens up the ability to take over Higgins Helitours on the Vespucci Helipad. Use the business’ equipment to give tourists a bird’s-eye view of Los Santos out front while hauling valuable cargo and taking down smugglers out back — cutting into your competitors’ supply. In addition to legitimate business operations, each of the above also hides less-than-legal Money Laundering activities behind the scenes, utilizing each front’s strengths and resources to support your empire’s financial health. Calling up Raf or using the laptop inside your fronts can launch unique Money Laundering missions — those launched from the Hands On Car Wash will pay out 2X GTA$ and RP this week, and other businesses will be receiving boosts in the weeks ahead. Earnings from these laundering ops are stored in the Duffel Bag in your Car Wash’s bedroom. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45517848/ae336d050b5666e38c06f5f420267cf682a984d6.jpg IT'S ALL CONNECTED Getting into the laundering game benefits your existing criminal network, with extra income from your other established businesses funneling into your front operation, delivering the cash to the Car Wash safe. Owning the Car Wash also boosts all Counterfeit Cash Factory Sales from your MC business (30% off this week), while Smoke on the Water provides a bump to all Weed Farm Sales. Operating Higgins Helitours as a front results in a lift for all Air Freight Cargo. Money Laundering Missions raise suspicion from the authorities in the form of Heat on your various fronts. Businesses with Heat will be blipped with caution signals on the map and require you to cool things back down via legal activity before generating further passive income. Clean up customer vehicles at the Car Wash, then return them to the client for a cash payment. Delivering bales of organic product from Smoke on the Water and conducting landmark tours with the Higgins company Maverick also lowers any Heat that builds up on those respective ventures while also providing a payout. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45517848/cc5db058436dc9465ddcd0a94e7290b26c7fc9c3.jpg MR. FABER WORK Professional money laundering services are in high demand, and Mr. Faber’s clients are not patient people. Lend your problem-solving expertise to the man behind the scenes and help his other clients in Mr. Faber Work by recovering stolen assets, escorting valuable cargo, and dealing with rival outfits. Use the laptop inside any of your Money Laundering Businesses — or call Raf directly — to assist with Mr. Faber Work for GTA$ and RP rewards, plus an added bonus once it’s been scrubbed of any traces of its shady origins. Completing Mr. Faber Work raises the Heat on the associated business it’s launched from, so remember to keep up appearances with legal activities to keep the funds rolling in uninterrupted. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/45517848/30161f83ad7424369fe3fb1541c650bff9053cda.jpg Money Fronts introduces six new vehicles, including the Överflöd Suzume, a supercar that’s available early to GTA+ Members through June 25 and free for Members to claim at The Vinewood Car Club until July 16.
