892970,Word From the Devs: Through the Roof,"Greetings vikings! We’ve truly hit the colder part of the year now, which gives us plenty of inspiration for the Deep North landscape. And just as we continue to work on the biome, Hervor Bloodtooth is continuing her journey: Many of you have speculated for a long time, and as we now take a closer look at some of the abandoned structures in the Deep North, we want to properly confirm that the update will add the possibility to build steeper roofs! The 67° roof pieces will be 4 meters high, and available for both the thatch as well the darkwood roof styles. We’re really looking forward to seeing all the new and creative ways you will use these build pieces! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/c2ff511ef45a3fda4ed67a0a39cd35cd7f3ec4c1.png We also want to offer you a bit of a mystery this month! It’s something to do with the crafting process in the Deep North, can you guess what these things will be used for? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/a6cc442ec1607dc1a8296cc21d79400d45e6d05b.png As we’re nearing the holiday season for many, we also want to make sure to give you some tips for Valheim themed gifts! In the Grimfrost merch store, we currently have a combo deal where you can get two plushies for the price of one. It’s only valid throughout Black Week though! We have also teamed up with the talented folks at Cantrip Candles, who have made a lovely set of Valheim themed scented candles! There’s one for the black forest, one for the ocean, and one for the campfire – and they all come with labels illustrated by Mats Minnhagen. These are also discounted at the moment, so now is a great time to grab them if you want them! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/cb9f956d0d6431baaa82be325b68b3b411260e21.png Build of the Month We want to take one last look at the spooky season before we make way for winter, so this month we have chosen to highlight this richly decorated hall by Captain Crumbs!

892970,Word from the Devs: Picking Up the Thread,"Hello vikings! We want to start with mentioning a Unity security vulnerability that occurred a few weeks back. There is no evidence that the vulnerability ever reached Valheim in any way, and we hurried to patch the game with the necessary updates from Unity as soon as we could. We didn’t make any announcement about this at the time as we didn’t want to cause unnecessary alarm, but we do also want to assure you that the game is safe for you to play. We thank you for your understanding! But now to the more lighthearted stuff! The time has come to finally check back in with Hervor Bloodtooth. Without further ado: The creatures down in the winding tunnels couldn’t best her! How do you think you’ll fare once it’s your turn to square up against them? They’ve caused quite a mess above the surface, after all… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/da36a600402ae7245d501e5637b8a7e7c7810c57.png Don’t worry though, there will be plenty of opportunities for creation in the Deep North too! The development of the biome is progressing well, and lately we’ve been focusing on things such as adding some interesting elements to the snow, as well as working out some new crafting extensions, just to name a few! We want to share the extension for the Galdr table with you as a little teaser, the loom: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/c669637af1f6065c022035b2c59b2635415c1078.png Before we round off, we want to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who stopped by our booth at Tokyo Game Show!

892970,Word From the Devs: We Fight On!,"Greetings vikings! Since our last check-in we have moved the Call to Arms update from the Public Test Branch and into the Live version of the game! We want to thank everyone who tested the game during the PTB, as well as everyone who has played it since the official release. We hope you’re not too bruised from your battles! There are possibly some more tweaks coming to that update in the coming weeks and months, as we want to see how everyone experiences the new changes, beyond those who tested in the PTB. But besides that we’re now focusing the team solely on content for the Deep North and 1.0. Armour sets are being designed, dungeons are getting fleshed out, and enemies are being animated. We’re itching for you to see it all, but we also want to make sure that there’s plenty of things left for you to discover on your own! We’re holding off a bit longer still to see what became of Hervor Bloodtooth but, just like last month, we want to show you something from the Deep North regardless. This time we’re taking a peek at some new furniture pieces, made from a new type of wood found in the biome. They’re a bit chunkier than what we’ve had so far, and both the chair and the table have some decorative designs carved into them. We look forward to seeing how the talented builders out there will use them in the future! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/04e865ec299242293a7fc5f650378fe1a30fccaf.jpg Just a few days ago we also finally made the announcement that Valheim is coming to PlayStation! It’s something that we’ve been getting many requests for over the course of Valheim’s development, and we’re really excited that it’s soon to come true. You can read more about the PlayStation release, as well as watch the new trailers (yes, multiple!), in the announcement post. As you may have guessed, the upcoming PlayStation release is the reason that we’re going to Tokyo Game Show next week, and those passing by our booth will have the opportunity to be among the first to play the game on a PlayStation console. We hope to see some fans there! You will also find Valheim at the boardgame fair SPIEL ESSEN in Germany in October! Our friends at MOOD will be there to showcase the Valheim boardgame which is now manufactured and ready to ship out to everyone who backed the Gamefound campaign. The booth at SPIEL will also be the first ever place where you can purchase the game in person! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/27cab3298f912a3a3348050d7840334e08c8951d.png Build of the Month This month we’re taking a closer look at this castle by ViRedy.

The Makeship campaign to get your very own Rocky is live right now, and this will be your only chance to get one, so don’t miss it! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/9b7bb32bd591a2c547608c7290cf18f8339a5fe7.jpg Speaking of plushies, it’s time to announce the winners of our Favour of Freya screenshot competition! The winners will each get a jumbo neck plushie, to give them emotional support in their continued virtual photography. The Scenic category we would like to award to BarefootCookie for this shot of a Charred warrior gazing out over the Ashlands. Wow! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/48ace08e534fdcff97884026eb22541f014fe0c9.jpg And the Action category we would like to award to Thaddeus for capturing this moment during a battle with Lord Reto. Incredible! Thank you everyone who submitted a screenshot for the competition, it’s been so much fun to get a glimpse into your very own Valheim adventures! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/c21e28e0a08cad37720f215f69edef2fd6331ecb.png Before we wrap up we have another part of the Voyage of Hervor Bloodtooth for you! As she continues to walk deeper into the snowy woods, it appears she’s not quite as alone as she first thought… Of course we will also give you a screenshot of that mysterious building she encountered there at the end.

Starting today, you’ll get to follow the journey of a viking as she travels to the Deep North and explores the new landscape there. Allow us to introduce you to Hervor Bloodtooth: /VIDEO She has arrived! Her adventure will continue – as will the sneak peeks of the Deep North – in the next blog post, with another short episode. Don’t miss out! If you’re not a fan of videos, we’ll of course continue to tease with images as well. Landing in the Deep North will offer you a sight of its shoreline, which can look like this: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/4817baa490bfa3265df72dc7b5cb47ea41443ead.png The northern lights and heavy, snow-covered trees are there to welcome any questing traveller.

892970,Development Blog: Lighting the Way,"Hello again vikings! It’s been a while since the last blog post, as we chose to instead just simply post the patch notes for the Bog Witch update last month. Speaking of, we hope you’ve been enjoying the update! If you haven’t checked it out yet, you have some new food and drink, as well as a curious new merchant waiting for you. As per usual, we want to thank everyone who has played so far! We also hope you enjoyed watching The Spill in October! If you missed it, it was a livestream featuring a whole bunch of games from the Coffee Stain umbrella, with various hangouts and talks. You can watch the VOD on our YouTube channel, with the Valheim segments marked down for your convenience. During The Spill we of course talked a bit about the Bog Witch, but we also talked about the Deep North and Valheim’s road towards 1.0. As you may have known already, the Deep North will be the final biome update as well as the update that marks Valheim leaving Early Access. We’ve still got a ways to go yet before we’re ready for that, but we’re hoping to make it a proper 1.0 package with new things to discover in early biomes as well. With the Bog Witch update behind us (save for perhaps some bug fixing), we are now all hands on deck with the Deep North and 1.0, and we would like to finally begin to share some teasers of what’s to come! For example, we want to take a moment to gaze up at the night sky, and the aurora borealis that dance there: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/75f18a8edd1ddf96671ce96d6bacd6f6270748d0.png We will continue to share images from the development with you, but we also want to keep some things a surprise for the actual release, so we promise there’s more happening behind the scenes than what we’re showing! Before we move on to the Build of the Month, we also want to say a heartfelt thanks to everyone who backed the boardgame version of Valheim! We reached our goal in less than an hour, which is incredible! The campaign has closed, but it’s currently open for late pledges. Keep in mind that this will be the very last chance to get some of the Gamefound exclusive items, which won’t be available in retail later. Build of the Month As per usual when we have skipped a blog post, we want to highlight two builds instead of one. This time, our eyes were caught by this village by Spac3_Sl0th.

For everyone that tested the Bog Witch update during patch 0.219.10: There was an issue with build pieces taking rain damage in the last PTB. This has been fixed in this version, but the fix cannot be applied retroactively.

892970,Development Blog: Counting Down,"Greetings vikings! Autumn is well and truly here, and it’s time for another run-down of what’s new! First off, let’s start with what’s most imminent. The Valheim board game is getting ready to launch its Gamefound campaign, so make sure to check it out if you haven’t already. The campaign goes live on October 1st, and we promise you don’t want to miss it! If any of you happen to be in Germany and have plans to attend the Essen Game Fair, SPIEL, MOOD will also be there to show off the game. Come say hi! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/2c17c89fccc9764c709605b5c4c5233993556819.png Something else to keep an eye out for is also The Spill, a livestream that Box Dragon and Coffee Stain will be hosting on the 8th of October. Plenty of games under the Coffee Stain umbrella, including Valheim, will have developers present to talk about the past, present and future. Keep an eye out on our socials for more information on the schedule and the exact timings, and we hope to see you in the stream chat! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/daa00ae301fa12a40d10b0c254eb71a3d2ca5956.png During the stream we will look back on the Ashlands development, but we will also be talking a bit about the future update that we started teasing a bit in the last blog post. In August we showed you a hut in the Swamps, and this time we want to give you a little sneak peek of what it looks like within: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/abf26781e80b83a41b9e49e1e8ffdb7bf96141de.png Before we sign off we also want to remind you all that we have shared another freelancer interview! This time it was Ghostwood Empire, the people behind the trailer music and the sound design of Valheim, who told us a bit about their process. It even includes a deeper look into the sound design of the gjall, and an exclusive look into the components of that distinctive call! And finally we want to make a shoutout to the wiki volunteers: the Valheim wiki has gotten itself a visual overhaul, which you can enjoy any time you want to look up any interesting facts. Thanks, wiki volunteers! Build of the Month This month we want to highlight not just one building, but an entire town!

It offers a bunch of tweaks and bug fixes which we hope you’ll enjoy, and we want to offer a big thank you to everyone who tested it in the PTB! Something you might have noticed over the summer, if you follow us on social media, is that we have gradually revealed more information about the Valheim board game! Together with MOOD we have shown off the player character minis as well as the bosses included – which will be Eikthyr, The Elder, Bonemass and Moder, since the board game will cover the first four Valheim biomes. The Gamefound page has also been updated with a more detailed explanation of the gameplay and a preview of what you’ll find in the game box itself.

Most notably, the Flametal mining and the spawn rates of several enemies have been adjusted. Hopefully this will all make your Ashlands experience more enjoyable! Abbreviated Patch Notes: * Tweaks and fixes to Flametal mining * Tweaked spawn rates for multiple Ashlands enemies * Trollstav tweaks * Various cooking fixes * Various build piece fixes * Multiple bug fixes and improvements Detailed Patch Notes: * Players no longer get stuck in falling animation on flametal spires * Chance for Flametal Spires to start sinking on hit changed from 10% to 1% * Flametal spires drop rate changed to 2-4 per chunk * Flametal ore now makes correct sound when mined * Fixed an issue where network objects could become permanently corrupt, root cause of multiple issues (Player bases loading much slower over time in a multiplayer scenario; player bases being more prone to structural stability issues over time; random non-tamable enemies becoming tamed; random tamed animals dying) * Tweaked spawn amount for Asksvin * Tweaked spawn chance for Twitchers * Tweaked spawn chance for Charred Archers * Tweaked spawn chance for Charred Melees * Tweaked spawn chance for Voltures * Tweaked spawn chance for LavaBlob * Smoke bombs can now be used to put out fire * Trollstav can no longer be used in dungeons * Trollstav will now give a warning message when trying to spawn too many trolls * Spawned trolls can now be attacked by bosses * Tweaks to amount of damage players take from lava depending how deep into lava they are * Slightly higher threshold before taking damage from lava * Hare meat can now be cooked on the wooden cooking station * Asksvin & Volture meat now require the iron cooking station * Chicken meat will now be correctly attached to the hook on cooking stations * Voltures no longer make walking sounds when flying * Fader’s flame is no longer visible on longer distance than his body * Fixed a bug in the block list that made it possible to block yourself * Hot tub refuel effect now match other fire VFX * Stone portal is now able to be built on stone & black marble * Shield generator no longer take damage from being built over lava * Grausten arched roof pieces no longer display a gap between the top of two roof pieces * Fixed an performance issue related to grausten building pieces * Tweak to the small marble column hitbox * Fixed an issue where the Player List was not able to be closed. * Fixed bug where button rebind could be initiated with a controller but not cancelled * Fixed an issue with being able to switch tabs with keyboard while unified popup is displayed * The catapult will no longer duplicate stacked items * Magma fish is now interested in hot fishing bait * Immobilised tooltip will no longer show unnecessary stats * Loading screen will now freeze the window for a much shorter period. * The intro will now start playing while loading to shorten the overall loading time when starting the game for the first time. * You can now cycle through hints in the loading screen * Localization tweaks Mac: * Ping icon is now correct on non-singleplayer servers on Mac * Tweaks to functionality for scrolling to make it less resource expansive, noticeable on weaker systems. * Fixed an issue to make sure to register the Game Center platform id without the ""A:_"" prefix, since that would later break the parsing of the platform ID when adding players to the player list since it expects only one underscore to be present in the string. This would've caused issues with muting players via the player list, but with this fix, muting works as expected with MAS players. Xbox: * Fixed a crash issue that could happen when suspending the game * Pins on the minimap on Xbox is now a reasonable size on 4K displays * Fixed a bug that made the game think that every player in the player list was the local player. This bug was the root cause of multiple issues since privilege checks became completely broken. This impacted Managing Player Communication, Display Name and GamerPic, and Maintaining Multiplayer Session State. * Fixed a bug concerning Joinable Game Sessions and Online Play * Fixed an error on Xbox One caused by Mouse.current returning null if if no mouse is plugged in",1724740191,['patchnotes']

892970,Development Blog: In Case You Missed It,"Hello vikings! It’s been a little while since the last blogpost, since we wanted all the focus to be on the Ashlands update, which was released for PTB in April and went live for everybody in May. If you’ve been playing it, we hope you’ve had a good time! These past few weeks have also brought some other announcements, in case you’ve missed them. First of all, Valheim is now compatible with Mac! It’s something that people have been asking for pretty much since we released Valheim into Early Access, and now we’re finally happy to say that players can get their copy of Valheim from both the Steam store and the Mac App Store. Of course the Mac version supports full crossplay with other platforms. And just as exciting is the announcement of our very own Valheim board game! Our friends at MOOD Publishing – who have also developed board games such as Deep Rock Galactic and Battle of Gods – have done an incredible job with this, and we really couldn’t have left the task in more capable hands. You can find out more about the board game by signing up to its Gamefound page, and there might even be something extra in it for you if you do… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/16473375332bbe36b725bc9482365ebbb93a99b8.png We’ve also released more songs for the Valheim soundtrack! The tracks from the Mistlands and Ashlands updates are now available as a part of the original soundtrack, available right now on Steam, and soon on your streaming platform of choice. Although the Ashlands update has been released, that doesn’t mean we’re quite finished with it. We’re still looking into bug reports and the feedback you’ve sent us, and in the near future we will be working on improving and polishing the biome into the best version it can be. Because of this, there aren’t really any sneak peeks we can show you this time around, but we promise to share stuff when we’re able! We liked the approach of being more transparent during the Ashlands update as compared to the Mistlands update, and we want to continue in a similar vein in the future as well. Build of the Month Since we didn’t have a blog post the past two months, we wanted to make sure to share two additional builds this time around.

Prior to launching this update to the Default version of the game, we want to have a chance to discover bugs and fine-tune the balancing to ensure the best game experience. ACCESS: Right-click Valheim in your Steam library, then select ‘Properties’. In the new window, select ‘Betas’ and type in the code “yesimadebackups”.

As indicated by the access code, please ensure to create backups of your save files before playing. This patch offers a number of balancing tweaks to the Ashlands! If you want, you can view the numbers for yourself, but the gist of it is that several enemies have had a decreased spawn chance. There has also been a significant change to Flametal spires, so that they no longer sink into the lava once you start to mine them. Aside from this, there are also some more technical fixes for both Xbox and Mac. Abbreviated Patch Notes: * Balancing tweaks for the Ashlands * Multiple bug fixes for Xbox and Mac Detailed Patch Notes: Fixes & Improvements: * Decreased random spawn chance of multiple enemies in the Ashlands: ** Voltures: reduced spawn chance from 30% to 20% ** Twitchers : Spawn interval increased from 110 to 200, reduced spawn chance from 55% to 25%, maxSpawn decreased from 4 to 3 ** Twitchers : Spawn interval increased from 100 to 160, spawn chance reduced from 60% to 30%, maxSpawn decreased from 5 to 4 ** Charred Archer: Spawn interval increased from 240 to 320, reduced spawn chance from 40% to 20% ** Charred Melee: Spawn interval increased from 240 to 320, reduced spawn chance from 50% to 20% ** LavaBlob: Spawn interval increased from 200 to 260 * Flametal spires will no longer submerge when mined * Voltures no longer make walking sounds when flying * Fixed a bug in the block list that made it possible to block yourself Xbox: * Fixed a bug that made the game think that every player in the player list was the local player. This bug was the root cause of multiple issues since privilege checks became completely broken. This impacted Managing Player Communication, Display Name and GamerPic, and Maintaining Multiplayer Session State. * Fixed a bug concerning Joinable Game Sessions and Online Play * Fixed an error on Xbox One caused by Mouse.current returning null if if no mouse is plugged in Mac: * Instead of polling to check for availability of precise scrolling deltas, which is inefficient, especially on slower Macs, cache the value and only update it when the input layout changes. * The scroll modifier native plugin is now only applied when actually scrolling, and the scroll value is now set in Update() instead of reading it every time the scroll wheel function is called. This makes it less resource intensive, noticeable on weaker systems. * Fixed an issue to make sure to register the Game Center platform id without the ""A:_"" prefix, since that would later break the parsing of the platform ID when adding players to the player list since it expects only one underscore to be present in the string. This would've caused issues with muting players via the player list, but with this fix, muting works as expected with MAS players. ",1718697858,['patchnotes']

First of all, we'd just like to thank everyone who has played the Ashlands update thus far, and we hope you're having a good time! That being said though, we have gotten a whole bunch of feedback already, and we have some tweaks for you today. One of the main issues was that the new ship would get stuck against rocks and other surfaces, but with some material fixes it should be smooth sailing (hehe) from here on out. We have also solved an issue where portals wouldn't connect properly, as well an issue where even your cooking station would catch fire, along with various other bugs. Last, but absolutely not least, we have also hopefully solved the issue where you would be far too overwhelmed by enemies. As it was, the enemies were drawn to you whenever you stood near a tree that fell, or a tree that was taking damage from a fire caused by cinders. Now, enemies should only react to the sound of falling trees, and the sound from when you/enemies are damaging the environment, and not the fire from cinders. Please do continue to report bugs and leave feedback! Abbreviated Patch Notes: * Multiple balancing tweaks in the Ashlands * Multiple bug fixes & optimization Detailed Patch Notes: * Fixed issues which could cause Drakkar ship to get stuck * Fixed a balancing issue that could attract too many nearby enemies because of trees catching fire * Charred Warriors no longer spawn under the sea * Balancing tweaks to some of Fader’s attacks * Portals should no longer have a problem reconnecting after changing name * Tweaked collider to prevent rugs from clipping into the Grausten floor pieces * Ashwood walls with 26 and 45 degree angle now align better with the other Ashwood wall pieces * Cooking stations can no longer catch on fire * Building pieces will no longer start burning before being placed * Recipes for multiple armours and weapons in Ashlands has been updated to use correct workbench levels * Summoned Trolls now have a small chance to spawn cinders * Summoned Trolls are now immune to fire damage * Visual tweaks to Dyrnwyn * Visual tweaks to Bone Fragments * Tweaks to Ashen Cape visual behaviour * Corrected missing text strings * Compiler optimizations for Xbox * Sulfur now makes correct sound when picked up * Fixed a performance issue related to many damage numbers * Fixed an issue causing the download size to be unnecessarily large * Modding: IMonoUpdater no longer requires to be inherited from and error messages removed ",1713963701,['patchnotes']

For the last year or so, it's not been a great time to be a part of Embracer Group.

But now, Embracer Group doesn't exist anymore, at least not as one company. The group announced earlier today that it is splitting into three companies: Asmodee Group, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends. The ""& Friends"" part of Middle-earth Enterprises includes a number of familiar names, like Tomb Raider and Marvel's Avengers dev Crystal Dynamics, Dead Island 2 dev Dambuster Studios, Deus Ex dev Eidos-Montreal, and several more. Obviously IP like The Lord of the Rings, as well as Tomb Raider and others, now fall under Middle-earth Enterprises too, as well as media company Plaion, comics publisher Dark Horse, and Freemode. <a href=""https://www.vg247.com/embracer-group-splits-itself-into-three-companies?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steam"">Read more</a> ",1713776859,

892970,Development Blog: Decorative Details,"Hello vikings! March is nearing its end and we’re quite busy here at Iron Gate. Some of us were at GDC in San Francisco last week, and were even able to meet some of you! Unity had a booth where you could try out a bunch of games made with their engine and that included a Valheim setup – if you were there we hope you had a great time! Otherwise we’re currently spending most of our time ironing out a lot of wrinkles. Just like any biome, the Ashlands will feature several new mechanics, new materials, building pieces and enemies, and it’s important to get all of that working smoothly. Right now we’re solving as many bugs and issues as we can in order to give you the best experience possible! That being said, the Ashlands update really isn’t far away now, and in order to make sure you’re sufficiently prepared, we have put together this article for you, so that you know what to expect in terms of world generation, difficulty, and so on. But as always, onto the teasers! You might have noticed that we’ve promised that the Ashlands update will feature over 50 new build pieces (there were just over 35 for the Mistlands update, for comparison), and today we’d like to show you a decorative window in the new wooden material which will be accessible in the biome. Here it’s built together with regular wooden walls and black marble pieces: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/bc68c3dbca507b81c187edf03db35f46cdf7063f.png We also want to show you a new floor piece that will be featured in the Ashlands. Can we interest you in some diagonal boards? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/d658c90ce4eb6d1c3c6a868f2000e2af9c714392.png Build pieces won’t be the only way to customise your home though – the Ashlands update will also feature vines that you can plant yourself and have grow onto your house! They will grow wherever they are able to, however, so make sure they don’t cover the door… Something people were wondering was whether the vines would only be vines, or whether there would be something to harvest from them. To that, we’d like to reply with this little picture: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/df676d70a96eeccd894f4fef57b13ba5a29503f1.png Finally, in case you missed it, we have plushies in our merch store! There’s a lox and a neck, and a small troll head keychain. Aren’t they just the cutest? These are available for purchase right now, in case you need something to squeeze tight when the Ashlands update arrives… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/016f35b673484e897a574af7b7d71d8ba8674a2e.jpg Build of the Month This month we’re highlighting this island base by DetailNew37.

892970,Development Blog: Skulls and Blood,"Greetings! We had quite a bit of a tumultuous end to January here at Iron Gate, with our Discord server unfortunately getting hacked. The server has been built back up again and we once more invite you to join us there, though we’re sad to say that most of the chat history is now gone due to the hackers deleting almost all of the channels. Still, so many of you reached out to us to offer your support and well-wishes, and it means a lot to us to have such a caring community. You’re the best! But now on to the fun stuff: In case you’ve missed it, we are currently collaborating with Heroic Replicas! They have created some incredible Valheim replicas, both large and small, which you can now get your hands on. Check out their Kickstarter campaign, which is live for another couple of days. Book your items before February 26th while you have the chance! The best part about the Kickstarter is that it’s run entirely by Heroic Replicas, so it hasn’t impacted the Ashlands development at all! We’d of course like to continue to give you some sneak peeks of what we’re working on, and for that we’d like to start off with the third and final Walk & Talk episode. We hope you’ve appreciated the series! But of course we have some good old fashioned still images for you as well! The Ashlands is a hostile place, even for the creatures that live there. You’ll be able to stumble upon the corpses of some of them on your travels. Just be careful of whatever killed them in the first place… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/fbf445d6db0811ff28509c1fc0d771754fbb1c14.png The skulls of the very same creatures can also be used to create this fancy-looking wreath, which is both decorative and useful. Can you guess what for? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/28bd8047bc7f35630ae3cf5a8917cab449afbf94.png We also want to give you a clearer view of something from the Walk & Talk episode. We go into a bit of detail about the weapon customisation you’ll be able to experiment with in the Ashlands, and how you’ll use gems to give special properties to your items. This sword, for example, is the same sword that we’ve already shown you a lightning version of, but this is what it will look like if you upgrade it with a bloodstone instead: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/ef07625e74a5fd6bd83d6dc0a6ab53abf4c4f625.png Build of the Month Even though we’re yearning for spring, we couldn’t resist this dreamy winter castle by Chicken_Phobia.

We want to kick off the year right away with another episode of our Walk & Talk series; it seemed like a lot of you really appreciated episode one, and we hope you’ll enjoy listening to us chat once again: Just like last time, this episode shows off some things we haven’t revealed previously.

Like with all our updates, it will hit the PTB first and then the live version a short while after that. But for now we want to leave you with a little something over the holidays, so we’re going to share with you the first of a short series of “Walk & Talk” videos, in which community manager Josefin, artist/generalist Robin and programmer Jonathan chat about some Valheim and Ashlands topics. It’s not unlike the Fireside Chat videos we have previously made, but in a slightly different packaging: Just in case you missed it, we have also shared another interview with one of our freelancers. This time it was Lee Williams, the writer behind a lot of Valheim’s lore, who got to introduce himself and his creative process! And now, as usual, over to the teasers! Since it’s almost yuletide, we wanted to show you some of the tasty-looking dishes we have cooked up in the Ashlands kitchens.

892970,Development Blog: Well Equipped,"Greetings, vikings! November is pretty dark and dreary, but we hope to brighten the darkness with this blog post! As you may have noticed, we released a patch earlier this month which both featured a Unity upgrade as well as some seasonal items for autumn. Unfortunately it was released from the Public Test Branch a bit later than we had hoped, which meant that you didn’t get the jack-o-turnip and the pointy hat until after Halloween was over. We’re sorry about this, but we will make sure to switch this system to an automatic one in the future, so that you will always have the seasonal content available during certain times of the year! But as always, on to the teasers! We want to start off this post by showing off one of the new armour designs for the Ashlands, now fully modelled and textured. Since fire is not only a symbol of destruction, but also of rebirth and new beginnings, we have named this set after one of the two first humans in Norse mythology: Embla. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/019f10dc552df999fc3a8f5b0a99e59f66854f53.png And as you may recall, we have said that Fortress time! will be a central part of the Ashlands. This is still the case, and we wanted to show you a current peek of one of the eponymous fortresses. Of course, it will not just be the wall on its own that you have to get past… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/e67c13db39d0158df45447e6db6b5ef7ba93389f.png Last time we showed you some weapons that will be added to the game with the Ashlands update. Many of you pointed out that they didn’t look particularly magical or special compared to the earlier concept art, and you are correct. We won’t tell you just yet how you will be achieving the extra power boosts for these weapons, but we wanted to show you one of them in a more final form: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/2011c677daaa821a9fcade702991907452874c80.png Build of the month For this month, we want to show off this massive castle by aGurkis1!

892970,Development Blog: Heavy Hitters,"Hello, vikings! It’s time for another monthly check-in! As you may have noticed, there is currently a patch out on the Public Test Branch, which we as always invite you to play! It features an engine update – but also some seasonal content like the Jack-O-Turnip and a brand new witch hat! Since our last blog post, we have also announced the winners of the Trial of Tyr, and we have teased you a little bit about our internal Ashlands playtesting on social media. After that playtesting post, we got a lot of questions about whether or not you will need to start a new world when the Ashlands update is eventually released. The answer to that is that it won’t be strictly necessary to get the new content, but it will be something we strongly recommend in order for you to get the best experience. The same has been true for previous large updates as well, and will most likely be the case for the rest of Valheim’s Early Access period. You can of course still bring your current characters with you into your new worlds! But now on to the teasers, which we know you are all waiting for! First off, we want to go ahead and show you a small selection of the new weapons you’ll be able to craft in the Ashlands. Pictured below is a greatsword, a regular sword, a mace and yes, dual wielding axes. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/f6c8b7d98fbedee37a1e318d96ef6d26dc5cd391.png We also want to show you this mysterious contraption… It looks a bit like the Obliterator, but it does something quite different. What do you think this might be used for? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/95127423d0424af3122ea100d2410f23df5990e9.png We’ve previously shown you a bit of the Ashlands and what they look like where you will first set foot. But let’s also take a new peek at what they’re like further inland, where the lava can dominate pretty large areas! Crossing these lakes of molten rock will be a challenge of its own, we assure you… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/ce713edac651caccbf4b0279d5caa0fb4e18808c.png Build of the Month Since it’s properly autumn now, we couldn’t not choose this Swamps based stave church by splash_opain for this Build of the Month!

892970,The Trial of Tyr – Announcing the Winners,"The time has come to announce the winners of the very first Valheim speedrun competition – The Trial of Tyr! We're so impressed by everyone who attempted this difficult challenge and we want to thank everyone who gave it a go. But now, without further ado, we present to you our three champions: Third Place With the total playtime of 13 hours, 4 minutes and 7 seconds, the third prize goes to ""Mr ADEL"". You can watch the run in this YouTube playlist. Second Place The second place is claimed by ""ThreadMenace"", who completed the run in 10 hours, 52 minutes and 1 second. You can watch the entry on YouTube: First Place And finally, with a total playtime of only 7 hours, 54 minutes and 22 seconds, the grand victory goes to ""Time Traveler"" (or 时空旅行人, in the player's native Chinese). You can watch the full run on YouTube: Interview with the Winner Because we suspect you might all be a little bit curious about how one manages to kill all of Valheim's bosses in less than eight hours, we have asked Time Traveler some questions about the entry: Q: Could you please tell us a little bit about yourself? Who are you and how long have you been playing Valheim? A: Hello guys, I'm Zhengyuan, a Valheim player from China, also known as ""the Time Traveler"" (时空旅行人), which is the ID I use on Bilibili, a Chinese video site, or 森罗万象 (""the all-inclusive"") on Youtube. I primarily post my Valheim streams and guides on Bilibili. I added Valheim to my steam library on February 7 2021, when it was released into Early Access on Steam. My adventure as a viking started there and since then I have spent circa 4500h in Valheim -- almost all of my spare time is dedicated to it. It has become my favourite game ever. Q: You're pretty active in the community with making guides and videos. What motivates you to speedrun the game and why do you enjoy it? A: Oh, that's a long story. The first 50 hours I spent in Valheim were really tough. The ores cannot be teleported. I had to retrieve my items by corpse run, not to mention all the skill loss. And some mobs at the moment were so tricky to deal with, like the troll, bonemass, the stone golem... All these mechanisms made Valheim extremely hardcore and challenging. And I was definitely not alone. When Valheim was just released, players from all over the world should have similar experience of struggling that I had. Many would say it was extremely difficult to play Valheim solo, if not impossible. And I did it. After my first solo ""completion"" playthrough, I began to delve into my research on Valheim, like the items, the mobs, the mechanisms, and so on. I kept wondering how to turn some crisis into triumph efficiently, how to defeat the bosses without taking damage from them, or how to improve the efficiency in my solo gameplay, and had experimental or actual games through numerous characters and world saves. At some moment, I figured out I could set up temporary bases in the current biome, so as to save time from massive ore transfer. I understood different mobs have different damage resistances, which means it is more efficient to use spears on trolls or hammers on Bonemass to deal massive damage to their weak points. I studied the pattern of enemies and figured out what their flaws are and when they are vulnerable, which indicates when I could dodge and when I could fight back. As I have developed some useful survival techniques and accumulated some combat experience, finally I could complete Valheim without any death, or 一命通关, which means one-life completion in Chinese. At that moment I had played Valheim for circa 300 hours. Then I started posting my gameplay videos on Bilibili to share my gaming experience with my viewers. In China I am thought to be the first player to complete Valheim with one life, and have received some recognition and encouragement from the community. I am very grateful to that, and motivated to further refine my gameplay. Therefore, after my ""one-life completion"", I have achieved ""one-life speedruns"", breaking my own records, and focusing on both not dying and completing the game as fast as possible. As such, my videos gradually evolved into something about hardcore combat, extreme challenges, and breaking limits.Through my speedrun recordings, I want my viewers to understand and master my skills from a first-person perspective, so that they can improve themselves and have better combat in Valheim. I feel a great sense of accomplishment, willing to put a lot of passion into one-life speedrun. So I continuously challenge myself, surpass myself, and the contest is a great opportunity for me to prove all of it. Q: You managed to complete the game in under eight hours. How did you prepare for it? How many times did you attempt it before you were satisfied with your final submission? A: My previous answer explains a lot. I have some succeeded Valheim one-life speedruns before, and the trial of Tyr is also a one-life speedrun contest. Though it seems like I don't have to do somethi...",1696938042,

892970,Development blog: Creature Feature,"Well met, travellers! Summer has reached its end, but the Ashlands remain hot as ever. As you might have seen on social media a couple of weeks ago, we shared another piece of concept art – this time a light armour design. That brings us up to three separate armour sets for the Ashlands, which means there should hopefully be something you’ll like regardless of your playstyle! Last time we focused a lot on the landscape and terrain – and we’ve shown off another landscape image on social media since then too – so this time we figured we’d take another look at the Ashlands’ inhabitants instead. Like we have said many times already, game development is an iterative process and things often change over time. For example, we have ended up giving a new look to the Bonemaw Serpent, which lives in the seas surrounding the biome. Keep an eye out for those sharp spikes when you’re sailing! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/11ed39cdf0898076a57045c6f51c61347a15b97e.png We also felt that there was a type of enemy lacking.

You know by now that Valheim carries plenty of traces of old civilisations, and the Ashlands will be no exception. And even while most of the biome will be a fiery wasteland, the old ruins will still have kept a thing or two intact. We’ll let you discover for yourselves what can be found there, so for now we’ll just show you the Blender version of what they can look like: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/742d88db0a9b8d122f0f843b518818ab4086c4b0.png With the submissions for our Trial of Tyr closing last week, we would like to thank and commend everyone who managed to complete the game on hard mode!

892970,Development Blog: Lava Landscapes,"Hello again vikings! As you may have noticed, we took a small break from these monthly updates while the Hildir’s Request update was on the Public Test Branch. Much like with the Mistlands, we felt that it wouldn’t make for too much interesting reading while we were mostly looking at bug fixing and the like. But now Hildir has properly arrived in Valheim and we shall go back to the monthly blog posts! In case you’ve managed to miss it though, Hildir’s Request features a new merchant who will sell you some new and fancy clothing to wear around your house – after you have helped her with her requests, which entails going after some mini bosses who have laid their claim on some dungeons around the world. The update also features world modifiers to make your game easier or harder, or somewhere in between, so customise away! While the bugs were dealt with in Hildir’s Request, we have also been continuing to work away at the Ashlands. For example, we’ve been experimenting with the terrain generation to make it so that the Ashlands never border any other biomes other than Ocean. The journey there will be perilous, so you’d better be ready for it before you set sail! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/dd5df225f3e3a8e246c1c65e1a973f67290af778.png The terrain generation has also been focused on the various levels of elevation in the biome itself. We want it to feel exactly right – not like the large flats of the Plains nor the craggy hills and valleys of the Mistlands – and that requires a lot of iterations. We do believe we’re getting close to the kind of terrain we want now, especially when we get to come upon places like this: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/a85403610bb582d1af7ee1d3bacd16710ae9084f.png But you’d better be careful around that lava, because it’s going to hurt an awful lot to step in! At least for those who haven’t adapted to the infernal landscape, that is. It’s not all going to be fire and lava, though – the area is called the Ashlands for a reason! We have been working on getting different areas of the biome to feel distinct as well, with more trees and deep layers of ash closer to the coastline and more lava the further inland you go. Once upon a time the Ashlands was a lush forest full of life, before devastation happened… {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/4fd0e9357cf2961489e6ed4047329836c077892b.png And last, we also hope you haven’t missed that we have a speedrun competition going! Set the game to hard mode, kill all the bosses as fast as you can, and record the whole thing for a chance to lay claim to your very own unique viking tankard to celebrate your victory! You can read more about the competition and how to enter here. Build of the Month Since we’ve had the blog posts paused for a little bit, we’ll highlight several builds this time around! Take a look at this quaint cabin that HelloHellie made, this intricate tavern by therabbitramen and this twilit inn built by masshun_jp! If you want your creation to be featured, use the hashtag #ValheimBotM on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. You can view previous builds in this thread on Steam. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/14551099e3bbda8e4825f74d79238e62f1c6d852.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/6808d07f695009554387175810063738c68d6377.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/0b64956919c4f49ab8034e29016dc6bc3e34a058.jpg Until next time, vikings! /The Iron Gate team If you’d like to discuss the content of this post, please visit our Discord, or our forums on Reddit and Steam, or make a comment on social media!",1693393303,

892970,Patch 0.217.14 - Hildir's Request,"The time has come for all those who have stocked up on gold from troll caves and fuling villages! Said gold is the prime currency in the world of Valheim after all, and there's a new vendor in the tenth realm where you can spend your riches. For as you know, Haldor is not the only merchant in the family – and his sister Hildir has made her way to Valheim at last. But she has had some trouble on the way, and it appears most of her stock has gone missing. When you find her, she might request some help! By completing the tasks she has for you, you will unlock more things to buy from her – both new clothing as well as some other items that might come in handy in your base. This update also brings some long awaited server modifiers; select a lower difficulty for a more casual experience, ramp it up for a hardcore playthrough, or come up with a mix of your own! Besides general difficulty, you will find settings for portals, resources, raids and more, all so that you can customise your experience to your viking heart's content.

892970,THE TRIAL OF TYR,"Welcome to Trial of Tyr, Valheim’s Hard Mode Contest! Please note that these rules have been updated as of August 25th. If you have submitted an entry before that, make sure that it complies with the new and updated rules. If it does not, you are of course welcome to submit a new run. Vikings, the time has come to prove your worth to the gods once and for all. You’ve slain the mighty Eikthyr, you’ve bested the horrors that hide in the Swamps and you’ve taken Yagluth’s power as your own, but the Allfather has more in store for you. There can be only one champion, one viking that is stronger, braver and faster than everyone else. Welcome to the Trial of Tyr, a competition that will pit the best among you against each other in a race against time. To celebrate the upcoming Hildir’s Request update that will introduce difficulty levels to Valheim, we are announcing a hard mode solo deathless contest, challenging Vikings around the world to enter Valheim and defeat all bosses on hard mode solo, without dying and as fast as possible. The winner of this contest will dine in the halls of Valhalla with a custom-made engraved viking tankard that will bear the winner’s name and completion time. There are also three merch kits at stake for the first, second and third prize: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33695701/4aacf0288965aeaceacfec52a164dc3755940861.jpg As with every contest, there are rules you will have to follow in order to participate, and have your run be considered for first place. These are as follows: The run must be made by a single player without dying, external help or the use of any dev commands. No mods or other kinds of third party software are allowed. You are not allowed to exploit the game in any way. This includes the usage of bugs, glitches (for example, but not limited to: Clipping through objects, resetting status or even conditions by logging out, duping, and boss summoning exploits, etc.) and all other methods not intended by the developers which are used to gain an unfair advantage over other players. You must play with the “Hard” preset in the world modifier settings. You must stream and/or fully record your run. In order to pause the run (taking breaks are important!), players must toggle the pause screen, stop recording, then after the break, start recording and untoggle the pause screen. If the player needs to log out, the recording must restart as soon as the player presses play. Cuts in the recording may NOT be made during active playtime (when you’re able to freely move your character). When submitting, please calculate your total run time and subtract any pauses. We will verify the run time when watching your submission. You must play with a new character and a new world, on the official Trial of Tyr world seed: MX7L9GYcf2 (You are allowed to scout the seed in advance, but for the actual run you must make a new world). The run must be played on the current stable (default) branch of Valheim. Re-mapping keys is allowed, but only within the confines of the game. Using secondary software to bypass this is not allowed. Your time starts the second your character lands in the start temple, and the run is considered finished when the player has defeated all of the Valheim bosses (Eikthyr, The Elder, Bonemass, Moder, Yagluth and The Queen) and mounted their heads at the Ancient Stone Circle. The winner of the competition is the player with the fastest completion time — players can submit multiple runs if they manage to beat their previous times. Please upload your run and submit your entry according to this form, before Tuesday 19th September at 23:59 CEST / 14:59 PDT, to be considered for the competition. And should you want to show off your run, please make sure to use the hashtag #Trialoftyr on social media! Terms & Conditions",1692705716,
892970,Patch 0.217.13 (Public Test),"This update is for the Public Test version of Valheim, and may therefore be unstable.

As always, remember to be considerate towards players not partaking in the Public Test, in case they want to avoid spoilers. Please make sure to make backups of your save files before playing. Yes, we know we've said before that we hoped the last patch was going to be the final one before we release Hildir's Request to the default branch, but third time's the charm, right? If all things go well, we shouldn't need to make any further fixes after this in order to release it properly. After the last PTB patch a lot of you were upset that we did some changes to the newly added quick-stack function. In this patch, you'll find that it has been altered to once again be done with a single button press, but the inventory will automatically open up (and then close again) so that you can still see what you're actually doing with your inventory. Hopefully this is a change that will make most of you happy! Detailed Patch Notes: Fixes & Improvements: * “Quick stack all” hotkey added again by holding the use key when opening chests (The chest will now open so you can see what is being moved, and then close if you keep holding the key) * Increased the chance of starred Fulings to spawn inside Sealed Tower * Fixed the R-stick shortcut for the Stack All button while you are browsing the player inventory * Fixed an issue where the error “can’t add component to Terrain” was filling the player.log * Precision placement of buildpieces changed to only show when holding ctrl * Fix exception thrown when compressing modifier data of world with unmodified preset set",1692190815,['patchnotes']

Like last time, this patch makes your saves significantly less backwards compatible than other patches, so make sure you really do make extra backups this time. As always, we will do our best so that you will be able to continue with your save files when this goes live, but there is always a risk that you might have to restore your backups when playing on the public test. Patch notes: * Fixed issue with some worlds not showing up correctly * Fixed an issue with creating a character with the same name as a previous one * A permanent backup is now created when loading into a new world version in case you want to revert back * Bed issues fixed * Issue with monsters moving before finished being staggered fixed * Fixed issue where monsters could have the wrong weapon after exiting and re-entering an area * Fixed issue with loading worlds on dedicated server * Worlds with underscores in their names fixed",1685627046,['patchnotes']
